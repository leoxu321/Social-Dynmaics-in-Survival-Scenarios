0	3000	Hello!
6000	11000	Six weeks ago, I set out to discover whether 14 ordinary British men
11000	16000	and 14 ordinary British women could do something extraordinary.
16000	19000	Survive on two remote Pacific islands...
21000	23000	..filled with dangerous wildlife...
23000	25000	That is a big fucker.
25000	27000	It came right at me!
27000	30000	..at the height of the tropical storm season.
30000	34000	How on earth are we expected to survive in this?
34000	38000	What I want to find out is, has all of this cushioning
38000	41000	that civilisation has experienced over the last 50 years
41000	45000	made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct
45000	48000	that I believe is deep within us all?
50000	52000	In this groundbreaking experiment,
52000	56000	the castaways faced surviving entirely alone for six weeks.
56000	57000	Holy shit!
58000	61000	Tonight, I discover how both the islands fared.
61000	63000	You're really on more than nature, I say.
66000	69000	I'll reveal and explain the techniques
69000	71000	that men and women use to survive...
72000	75000	..find out how island life affected them...
75000	78000	I am not the same person who went to the island.
81000	83000	It's the best thing I've ever done.
83000	86000	..and what it was like when they returned to civilisation.
86000	87000	Oh!
87000	89000	What the hell's going on?
89000	91000	Showered and everything!
91000	92000	Oh!
92000	93000	No way!
93000	95000	It's absolutely brilliant, babe.
95000	97000	Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.
106000	109000	After 41 days, I returned to the islands
109000	112000	to find out how the castaways have stayed alive
112000	114000	using only their wits
114000	116000	and some basic survival skills.
116000	117000	Is it him?
122000	124000	Such a big part of me is so relieved
124000	126000	we've reached this point where we're extracting them.
126000	129000	This is the most in-depth experiment I've ever done.
129000	131000	Six weeks, height of a rainy season.
131000	132000	Brutal.
139000	140000	Welcome!
140000	142000	Wow, look at you guys.
142000	143000	Well done.
143000	144000	Well done, you.
144000	145000	Thank you.
145000	146000	Well.
146000	147000	Done.
147000	148000	You.
148000	149000	Amazing.
149000	150000	Thank you.
150000	151000	Genuinely.
151000	153000	I think what's interesting about doing two separate islands,
153000	155000	one for the men, one for the women,
155000	158000	is seeing how two very different groups of people
158000	160000	cope in the same hardships.
162000	163000	Look at you guys.
163000	165000	I thought I smelled bad.
165000	167000	I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work, isn't it?
167000	168000	Success!
168000	169000	It's the smell of success.
169000	170000	Thanks for coming back.
170000	171000	Yeah.
171000	172000	Let's have a look at the camp.
172000	175000	We would like to introduce you to the Croc and Trotter,
175000	177000	which is the name of our camp.
177000	178000	Guys, this looks incredible.
178000	179000	It's all right, isn't it?
179000	182000	You know, this is like out of a movie set, Robinson Crusoe.
182000	183000	Yeah.
183000	184000	So with this sign here,
184000	186000	I think this is like a symbol of how far we've come.
186000	190000	So it's no longer a camp, but it's now our home.
190000	191000	Sounds a bit like a pub.
191000	192000	Yep.
192000	193000	Correct!
193000	194000	That's what we're doing.
196000	200000	I discovered they'd constructed a fire pit and seating area,
200000	201000	a communal table,
201000	203000	and individual raised beds...
205000	207000	..that even built themselves a staircase.
208000	211000	Because of the torrential rain, that hill was treacherous,
211000	214000	so one of the first things we did is,
214000	216000	while everyone else basically built the shelter,
216000	217000	I built the steps.
217000	218000	You know, little things like that
218000	220000	where you're trying to conserve energy.
222000	225000	As a team, we definitely thrived, no doubt about it.
225000	227000	I mean, you only have to go and look round the camp
227000	229000	to realise that it was a pretty serious set-up.
231000	232000	Respect.
232000	234000	You know, I know what you guys have been through.
234000	235000	Brutal.
235000	237000	Good effort, you know.
239000	243000	On the women's island, they took a different approach.
243000	244000	Would you like a tour?
244000	245000	I can't wait to see it.
245000	246000	Coconut.
246000	247000	It's our passe.
247000	249000	Made by coconuts that we ate.
250000	252000	You've eaten a lot of coconuts.
252000	254000	Far too much coconuts.
256000	258000	The women had made a huge effort
258000	260000	to make their camp feel homely and cheerful.
260000	262000	Wow, guys, look at this.
262000	263000	This is cool.
263000	264000	It's very cool.
264000	266000	And it's so clean.
266000	271000	You know, it is not easy to get an island like this clean.
271000	272000	This is amazing.
274000	277000	This is way better than I expected.
277000	279000	And I look at how the men did stuff
279000	282000	and it was functional, technical.
282000	284000	It didn't have this kind of warmth.
284000	287000	Little touches of decoration, you know.
287000	289000	To me, it has much more of a heart...
289000	290000	..to it.
290000	291000	This is home.
294000	296000	The first rule of survival
296000	299000	is to find a safe place to build shelter.
299000	301000	Just see the rocks in the distance just there?
301000	302000	That's home.
302000	304000	That's where we're going.
304000	306000	The men chose an excellent spot.
306000	307000	Booyah!
307000	308000	Beach!
308000	310000	It was close to the sea,
310000	312000	which is a great source of food,
312000	314000	but set back enough from the beach
314000	316000	to give the natural protection from the elements.
316000	318000	Because it's elevated,
318000	320000	this is not really going to get that wet.
322000	324000	Right, what do you want me to do, Paul?
324000	327000	What we need now are cross members.
327000	329000	Having chosen their location,
329000	331000	the men set about building shelter
331000	333000	to protect themselves and their fire
333000	335000	from the frequent tropical storms.
335000	337000	It's got a fairly good canopy.
337000	339000	It's got four corners that we can notch off,
339000	342000	put rope into, cover over the top.
342000	344000	From my experience in the wild,
344000	346000	constructing a good shelter is crucial.
346000	347000	Not only to get yourself out of that water,
347000	350000	but also just for morale.
350000	352000	You know, if you're just getting pissed off
352000	353000	all day, all night,
353000	355000	to have somewhere to hide away,
355000	357000	get out of it, means so much.
359000	362000	So, um, these are the dormantries.
362000	365000	The men went on to build individual covered beds
365000	367000	that were raised off the floor
367000	369000	to protect them from the jungle critters.
369000	371000	A group of guys decided that they were going to start
371000	373000	throwing up a bed for everybody,
373000	375000	and then you would personalise your own bed
375000	377000	by putting a roof on your pitch,
377000	379000	depth of bed, length of bed, that sort of thing.
379000	381000	The beds were built using A-frames
381000	384000	and lengths of washed-up rope for their mattresses.
384000	387000	OK, whose is the best, do you reckon?
387000	389000	Mine.
389000	391000	And that's this one.
391000	393000	A man's bed is his castle.
393000	395000	I got stuck into my bed, making it as comfortable
395000	397000	as I possibly could, cos once I'd got in that bed,
397000	399000	I wanted that to be my personal place for me to go,
399000	401000	close my eyes and be at home.
401000	404000	So I realised, once they decided to make individual beds,
404000	406000	pick a decent one, make it a palace.
406000	408000	Are you happy for me to have it, guys?
408000	410000	By all means, sir.
410000	412000	Are you going to be sad to leave this, Vic?
412000	414000	Yes, I am, yeah, yeah.
414000	416000	That was my one luxury on this island,
416000	419000	and a good night's sleep every night.
419000	422000	Oh, God, yes.
422000	425000	If the beddies are rocking, don't come and rock in.
428000	430000	Oh, Jesus.
430000	433000	It's really dense up here, so we need to get moving.
433000	435000	On the women's island,
435000	437000	establishing a base camp took longer.
437000	440000	This is the direction where we should be heading in.
440000	443000	The group split, and after getting lost in the jungle...
443000	445000	I think it's that way.
445000	448000	..it took them nine days to establish a permanent home
448000	450000	with a sustainable water source.
453000	457000	For the women, it wasn't until their final week on the island
457000	460000	that they came up with the idea for a communal bed
460000	462000	where they could keep each other warm.
462000	464000	OK, and then just tie that there. Perfect.
465000	468000	We felt that it was a really important way
468000	472000	of utilising our greatest resource, which are plastic bottles.
472000	474000	And you can probably get six or seven of us on it.
474000	475000	And it's fully lined.
475000	477000	Can I have a go? Please go and lie on it.
477000	479000	I mean, it's not quiet... No, it's not quiet.
479000	480000	..but it's comfy.
483000	484000	I mean, this is...
484000	487000	This is 1,000 times comfier than the male one.
487000	489000	Yes! Yes!
491000	494000	The only thing is, you get up in the middle of the night, go for a pee,
494000	496000	everybody knows you're getting up.
497000	499000	What have you been sleeping on before this?
499000	501000	Beach. The beach.
501000	502000	Which is brutal.
502000	504000	But it's not bad if you're spooning, Bert.
504000	506000	No. We love a spoon.
513000	516000	There were several really good reasons for sleeping as a group.
516000	517000	There was a sense of safety.
517000	519000	If there were anything nasty was to come into camp,
519000	521000	the group was there to deal with it.
521000	523000	You've got to choose your spot now, Georgie.
524000	528000	Mmm, decisions, decisions.
529000	532000	I think we were really happy with spooning in a really sad way.
532000	535000	It was quite a big comfort for a lot of us
535000	537000	and definitely a way to keep warm.
537000	539000	Nice and warm.
542000	545000	You know, maybe this is a difference between men and women.
545000	547000	The men wanted their space.
547000	549000	They wanted these individual shelters where they can hide away
549000	551000	and they go, I'm annoyed with him.
551000	553000	I close my curtains and I'm done.
553000	555000	But actually, community is strength.
557000	561000	I very much anticipated that the women would be very much the homemakers.
561000	564000	It would be right top of their list to build shelter.
564000	567000	I think it was interesting just how long it took.
567000	569000	They look pretty good.
569000	572000	Oh, for fuck's sake.
572000	574000	They just didn't have the skills.
574000	577000	They had to learn these skills by getting things wrong
577000	579000	and they got there in the end.
579000	582000	But one thing the women were better at was making fire.
582000	585000	They did it much quicker than the men.
585000	587000	So this is Vesta.
587000	591000	She was absolutely flaming, but she's decided to go a bit down.
591000	592000	Why Vesta?
592000	595000	Because Vesta is the Roman goddess of the hearth.
595000	598000	For us, she's been the heart of the camp
598000	600000	and the main thing that we've kept going.
600000	603000	The women used a traditional friction-based method,
603000	606000	spinning a bow drill to create heat by friction...
606000	608000	Bloody good ember.
608000	611000	..then blowing on the ember to breathe life into the flame.
611000	613000	Here we go! Oh, my God!
613000	614000	Wow!
614000	615000	It's got fire!
615000	616000	It's got fire!
622000	625000	Well, we tried all sorts, the bow and the shaft thing,
625000	628000	holding it and rubbing it up and down like fools
628000	630000	and sweating onto it and spoiling it.
630000	632000	We got no smoke or anything.
632000	634000	To me. To me.
634000	635000	Awesome.
635000	638000	That learning curve just went like a U-bend. Boom.
638000	640000	It's gone out of need. Fuck all.
641000	644000	Just basically using the sun to focus there in one point
644000	646000	has given us quite a lot of heat.
648000	652000	It was Kyle that sat most of the second day having a go at it.
652000	654000	I mean, that man's determination was unbelievable.
654000	656000	Sat for hours holding his glasses.
656000	657000	Come on.
659000	661000	Get the sticks ready, lads.
661000	663000	Get up there, get up there.
663000	666000	You've got it, you've got it, you've got it!
666000	668000	Go, go, go!
668000	669000	Yeah!
669000	671000	He was the unsung hero. He really was.
671000	673000	And, my God, we thanked him for it.
676000	678000	Fucking yes!
678000	679000	You nailed it.
679000	681000	You're the hero.
683000	686000	But the fire didn't help them deal with the sandflies,
686000	688000	which attack at sunrise and sunset
688000	691000	and they feed on the protein in human blood.
693000	695000	Oh, it's swollen.
695000	697000	They were unmerciful.
697000	698000	They really were unmerciful.
698000	699000	Scabbed.
699000	701000	Oh!
701000	704000	They got covered head to foot in sandfly bites
704000	707000	and that can have a real demoralising effect.
707000	709000	You're scratching, then things get septic,
709000	712000	you know, you've got salt wounds, a big no-no.
712000	714000	They bit constantly.
714000	716000	Yeah, constantly being bitten.
716000	718000	You can just see them all flying around, it's horrible.
718000	721000	It makes me itch thinking about the insects.
721000	724000	They were everywhere, in people's knickers.
724000	727000	There was no way you could sit down at all unless you're in the water.
727000	730000	Unless you're in the water where some sort of insect
730000	734000	or some sort of bug is not going to absolutely tear your skin apart.
734000	737000	I feel like I'm turning into the fucking Elephant Man.
737000	740000	If anybody films me, I'll kick off.
742000	744000	You fucking bitch!
748000	751000	Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.
753000	755000	And neither did the men escape unscathed.
755000	756000	Oh, God!
758000	760000	Sandfly, seriously.
760000	762000	I'll burn or cut this island down
762000	764000	if that's what it means to get rid of them.
766000	769000	But the islanders came up with some ingenious techniques
769000	771000	to ward off the island critters.
771000	773000	You seal your hood round and put your boxer shorts
773000	776000	that you've been wearing for four weeks over your face.
776000	780000	You just sleep in that rigid position for, you know, six hours.
782000	784000	Just put that over like that.
784000	785000	There he is.
785000	786000	Perfect.
786000	791000	It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever been through in my life.
791000	793000	You mean you don't love the great outdoors, Jill?
793000	795000	Not when I can't see it,
795000	799000	cos I've got to sleep with a fucking T-shirt over me face.
799000	802000	I may as well be at fucking home with the lights out.
803000	807000	And the women used some extra resources not available to the men.
808000	811000	The sanitary bag got misused
811000	814000	and we found a few stuck sanitary towels all over your face.
814000	815000	That's not misused.
815000	817000	They kept them away.
817000	819000	That's exactly the right use.
819000	821000	I cleanse my face with sanitary towels now.
821000	823000	Now I've run out of cotton pads, you can't complain.
823000	825000	You're like, oh, sanitary towel, that'll work.
828000	830000	After six weeks utterly alone,
830000	833000	I've returned to see how the men and women adapted
833000	835000	to surviving on their islands.
836000	839000	When it comes to survival, I often talk about the rule of three,
839000	842000	which means you can survive three minutes without air,
842000	844000	three days without water,
844000	846000	three weeks without food.
847000	851000	During tropical storm season, rainwater is plentiful.
851000	853000	As it rained, it used to come off the trees,
853000	855000	so we used to collect it that way.
855000	857000	It's running like a bloody tap.
857000	859000	We nicknamed it the Jungle Tap.
863000	866000	But once it hits the ground, water is contaminated.
866000	869000	You've got to purify water properly.
869000	871000	If you don't, you're going to get sick,
871000	873000	and groundwater can contain
873000	875000	a whole host of nasties.
875000	878000	Oh, my God, that is horrible.
878000	880000	If you think about it, it's where the animals,
880000	883000	they come to drink, but also it's where they come to crap.
883000	885000	So we'll fill the reservoir to the max
885000	887000	and we'll let gravity do the rest.
887000	891000	With each man needing to drink between two and four litres a day,
891000	895000	they invented a filtering system to purify the water before boiling.
897000	900000	It still doesn't look as clear as I was hoping it would.
900000	901000	No.
901000	903000	We've put it through several bottles with sand,
903000	905000	with a bit of a ripped-up T-shirt in the bottom
905000	907000	to try and filter out all the crap.
908000	910000	It doesn't taste like piss, does it?
911000	913000	It is like... It tastes like middleweight tea.
913000	916000	Have you learned to hate drinking warm water?
916000	918000	No, I don't mind it.
918000	920000	And actually, it's good.
920000	922000	It's really good.
922000	924000	You don't have to kind of just knock it back.
924000	925000	It's decent water.
925000	927000	The water was not an issue.
927000	929000	And actually, dehydration was your own fault
929000	930000	rather than lack of water.
930000	931000	Yeah.
934000	936000	On the women's island,
936000	939000	their water source was far more polluted than the men's.
939000	941000	That is fucking disgusting.
941000	944000	It is. It really is.
944000	946000	Definitely double filtering there.
946000	948000	Fucking hell.
948000	950000	Their system was simple but effective,
950000	952000	using one jerry can to filter
952000	955000	while the other was constantly on the boil.
955000	959000	I think it was Jamie's sock, a little bit of charcoal, my bra,
959000	962000	and literally just dripped it through very, very slowly,
962000	965000	and within a day, you've got 30 litres of the stuff.
967000	969000	I don't want to drink the water.
969000	971000	It tastes of poo.
971000	974000	You drink it, then you gulp,
974000	976000	and then you vomit.
980000	984000	With water sorted, they now needed to feed themselves.
984000	987000	I ensured they had enough indigenous animals,
987000	990000	vegetation, and water to keep them alive.
990000	993000	What they had to do was have the ingenuity
993000	995000	to find it, catch it, and kill it.
995000	998000	Welcome.
998000	1001000	Before entering this extreme environment,
1001000	1003000	they were given basic survival training
1003000	1005000	in what they could hunt and trap.
1006000	1011000	These were just regular, ordinary, everyday people in regular jobs.
1011000	1013000	Diverse jobs, but everyday jobs.
1013000	1015000	This is a boa constrictor.
1015000	1017000	This guy is edible.
1018000	1020000	They do get huge.
1020000	1022000	They've been known to take small children.
1024000	1026000	You can't afford to be squeamish.
1026000	1029000	Killing your food is a survival reality.
1029000	1031000	If it's food, it's fuel.
1031000	1034000	You're a testament to British engineering, this will be.
1034000	1038000	In my experience, one of the most energy-efficient ways of hunting
1038000	1040000	is trapping.
1040000	1042000	If it works.
1042000	1045000	From the intricate Cayman box trap,
1045000	1046000	which, when set off,
1046000	1048000	forms an inescapable prison...
1048000	1050000	Meow!
1050000	1053000	..to the simple spring-loaded trap,
1053000	1056000	which uses a trigger system to ensnare the animal.
1056000	1059000	It comes down to feed or water.
1059000	1061000	Pour a little bit of beer down.
1063000	1064000	Bingo.
1064000	1067000	I had this TV view of trapping.
1067000	1069000	You make one trap, you catch one animal.
1069000	1071000	No, no, no, no.
1071000	1072000	OK, ready?
1072000	1074000	You have to put out a lot of traps,
1074000	1075000	you have to keep going back,
1075000	1077000	you have to keep going back to them,
1077000	1080000	and eventually, if you're lucky and you've done it right,
1080000	1081000	you'll catch something.
1081000	1082000	Right, I'll distract him.
1082000	1084000	Hey, Mr Croc!
1084000	1087000	But once you've trapped an animal, you need to kill it.
1087000	1089000	We need to get a loop over that mouth.
1090000	1093000	Ooh! Look at that beauty!
1093000	1096000	With the crocodile, the men used a noose to control the jaws
1096000	1098000	so it could be manoeuvred into position.
1098000	1101000	Watch him, watch him! Go now, go now!
1101000	1103000	Then they used their body weight to pin it down.
1103000	1104000	Come on, all right!
1104000	1106000	Yes, mate, yes!
1106000	1107000	That's it.
1107000	1110000	And dispatch as quickly and humanely as possible.
1110000	1113000	The technique that they used to catch that crocodile
1113000	1115000	was actually textbook.
1115000	1117000	It was pretty impressive, because there's no doubt,
1117000	1120000	you know, you're faced with the number-one predator on the island.
1120000	1121000	It's intimidating.
1123000	1126000	I felt very, very strongly, like, if we're going to kill stuff,
1126000	1128000	we should kill it humanely
1128000	1130000	and we should not waste any scrap of it.
1130000	1132000	Come on, look at that!
1132000	1133000	Whoa!
1133000	1135000	Mate, get in!
1135000	1136000	Unbelievable!
1136000	1138000	Let the feast begin, boys!
1138000	1139000	Yes!
1143000	1144000	These are some of the trophies we kept.
1144000	1146000	We absolutely ate everything.
1146000	1148000	Seven feet of beautiful crocodile.
1148000	1150000	That's all that remains, pretty much, apart from the sign.
1150000	1152000	Thing is, if you hesitate, you lose.
1152000	1154000	Set your traps, set multiples of them.
1154000	1155000	You've got to be opportunistic.
1155000	1157000	It's great, you're right.
1157000	1158000	Dosh.
1159000	1164000	While some men accepted that killing was necessary to eat...
1164000	1166000	Hi, sage and onion.
1167000	1168000	Ooh!
1168000	1170000	..one of the things I think the women struggled with
1170000	1173000	was putting aside their instinct to nurture
1173000	1176000	and turning it to an instinct to hunt and to kill.
1179000	1182000	Hunting and killing has been the biggest eye-opener
1182000	1184000	that I've taken from the island.
1184000	1187000	Taking a life is never easy,
1187000	1190000	and for the women, it was a real turning point.
1190000	1194000	They overcame one of the hardest psychological obstacles,
1194000	1197000	showing they had what it takes to be survivors.
1201000	1204000	You can spend a week trying to trap an animal,
1204000	1207000	and then the actual killing process is pretty gruesome.
1207000	1209000	It's actually a really emotional thing.
1209000	1213000	Using a knife, the most humane way to dispatch an animal,
1213000	1215000	one way to dispatch a pig,
1215000	1217000	is by severing its jugular veins,
1217000	1219000	which renders the animal unconscious.
1221000	1224000	It was so hard. It was horrible.
1226000	1230000	It took them a long time to embrace the hard reality
1230000	1232000	of this isn't going to be pretty.
1232000	1235000	But from that point on, the women, just like the men,
1235000	1237000	were able to take their rightful place
1237000	1239000	at the top of the island's food chain.
1241000	1243000	While there's plenty to eat on land,
1243000	1244000	and you can catch it,
1244000	1247000	the most reliable source of food for the men and the women
1247000	1249000	wasn't on the island at all.
1250000	1253000	All of the seas around here are literally teeming with life.
1253000	1256000	There's something like 500 different edible species of fish,
1256000	1259000	and it's why, when it comes to desert island survival,
1259000	1261000	I always say to people, fish first.
1261000	1264000	Once you figure out how to catch them,
1264000	1267000	you've got a well-stocked larder right on your doorstep.
1267000	1269000	Oh, look, look, look, look!
1269000	1271000	Rays. Fuck, they're shallow, aren't they?
1271000	1273000	Come on, boys, let's get one of these.
1273000	1274000	It's easier said than done
1274000	1277000	when you don't have the right tools for the job.
1277000	1279000	Stingrays won. Survivors now.
1279000	1281000	Yeah!
1281000	1283000	No, she just lost it!
1283000	1285000	Get him behind it.
1285000	1287000	Oh!
1287000	1288000	Cut him off.
1288000	1291000	Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?
1291000	1295000	I don't think any fish you couldn't, couldn't eat around.
1295000	1297000	It's rubbish.
1297000	1299000	I loved the fishing.
1299000	1302000	I loved doing the fishing, but I was rubbish at it.
1302000	1303000	Bastard him.
1303000	1305000	That spear's not worth donkey poo.
1305000	1307000	Fucking rubbish.
1307000	1310000	Then the reality kicks in that you have no idea what you're doing
1310000	1313000	and hopefully that you're going to be able to clutch at things
1313000	1314000	to make them work.
1314000	1316000	That's why it's called fishing and not catching.
1316000	1318000	It was a big learning curve.
1318000	1320000	It really was a big learning curve.
1320000	1322000	You fucking beauty!
1324000	1326000	Look at the size of that bitch!
1326000	1328000	As part of their basic survival kit,
1328000	1331000	I provided both islands with a handful of fishing hooks.
1333000	1335000	Oh, Barney, you're an inch or two longer.
1335000	1338000	It's directly proportional to the size of my penis.
1338000	1341000	Which meant they could experiment with improvised rods.
1341000	1343000	That idea is so romantic, isn't it?
1343000	1345000	To be able to carve your own fishing rod,
1345000	1348000	sit there with your stick like a gnome and soak up the sun.
1348000	1350000	Oh, I got a big one!
1350000	1351000	Whoo!
1353000	1354000	Fuck!
1354000	1356000	But it was far from romantic, really.
1356000	1358000	It was a really hard graft.
1358000	1360000	Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
1360000	1362000	She's caught a fish!
1362000	1363000	There it is!
1363000	1365000	Daddy brought home the bacon!
1365000	1366000	Yeah!
1366000	1367000	Yeah!
1367000	1368000	Yeah!
1368000	1369000	Yeah!
1369000	1370000	Oh, I saved everybody.
1370000	1371000	I was almost like Jesus.
1371000	1374000	I fed the thousands with nothing more than a homemade fishing rod.
1376000	1379000	In a survival situation, the sea can be a lifesaver.
1379000	1381000	But if you don't treat it with respect,
1381000	1383000	it can just as easily take you out.
1385000	1386000	There he's gone!
1390000	1391000	Oh, shit!
1392000	1394000	Whoo-hoo!
1394000	1395000	I've seen it happen.
1395000	1399000	A misjudged tide or a freak wave and it's game over.
1399000	1401000	Rock fishing can prove deadly.
1401000	1404000	Best fishing was always in the most dangerous spot.
1404000	1406000	And bad shit happens really quickly.
1406000	1408000	It takes 12 months for Christmas to come.
1408000	1410000	Bad stuff happens that quick.
1410000	1412000	And that's why rock fishing is considered
1412000	1415000	one of the most dangerous sports in the world.
1415000	1417000	Oh, my God!
1417000	1418000	Oh, shit!
1418000	1421000	Literally, within half a second, he was gone like that.
1421000	1423000	And it was genuinely terrifying.
1423000	1425000	And I just remember screaming at the top of my voice,
1425000	1426000	Ross!
1433000	1437000	There's nothing like a successful hunt to lift the spirits.
1437000	1439000	Is this the first time we've actually had breakfast?
1439000	1440000	Yeah, I think it is.
1440000	1441000	Amazing.
1441000	1443000	But as I know from experience,
1443000	1446000	the island diet can have a few unwelcoming effects.
1446000	1449000	The island diet can have a few unwelcome repercussions.
1452000	1454000	Oh, pardon me.
1454000	1456000	Sorry.
1456000	1458000	God, that was horrible.
1458000	1460000	I'm going to have to go.
1460000	1462000	Oh, no, you're not going to be sick, are you?
1462000	1464000	I don't know. I don't feel very well. Sorry!
1465000	1466000	Pardon me.
1466000	1469000	Why does that always happen when I'm talking about food?
1469000	1471000	That's not what's supposed to happen.
1471000	1474000	Basically, I've been having explosive diarrhea.
1476000	1480000	I would get completely naked, do a poo...
1482000	1485000	..and just run straight into the sea
1485000	1488000	and have a shower and bath in the sea.
1488000	1491000	With no modern conveniences on the island,
1491000	1495000	the call of nature presented something of a dilemma for the women.
1495000	1497000	You were doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah.
1497000	1498000	What?! Yes.
1498000	1499000	Are you kidding me? No.
1499000	1501000	Why are you shitting in the ocean?
1501000	1503000	Because it's clean.
1503000	1504000	Going for a poo.
1504000	1505000	A lot of people went in there.
1505000	1508000	A lot of people went into the jungle and dug holes.
1508000	1510000	I have to confess,
1510000	1513000	I was really worried about something biting my bum,
1513000	1516000	so I used to go just on the water's edge,
1516000	1518000	which I know upset a lot of people.
1519000	1523000	The men weren't so fussy about where they did their business.
1523000	1524000	Here comes my esteemed colleague.
1524000	1527000	I think he might have some good news for the camera.
1527000	1530000	I've officially dropped anchor in Poo Bay three times.
1531000	1533000	Oh, such a relief. I feel like a new man.
1533000	1534000	Going in the sea, for me,
1534000	1536000	it was absolutely perfect.
1536000	1538000	So I've started shitting in the bath.
1542000	1545000	Six weeks after abandoning the men and women
1545000	1547000	on two remote tropical islands,
1547000	1551000	I went back to see for myself how they managed to stay alive.
1556000	1558000	Shit!
1558000	1561000	It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.
1561000	1564000	Sometimes the hardest thing about surviving on a island
1564000	1567000	is living with your fellow castaways.
1567000	1569000	It's fucking immaturity.
1569000	1571000	It's sulking and it's attention-seeking.
1571000	1574000	They don't know this is not an enjoyable experience for me.
1574000	1576000	I fucking hate it.
1576000	1578000	You pointing a finger at me and saying,
1578000	1580000	well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.
1580000	1581000	Kyle!
1581000	1583000	We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,
1583000	1585000	and it looks like... Yeah, yeah.
1585000	1587000	Looks like you're doing fuck-all when it comes to wood.
1587000	1589000	Before I went into the island, I was worried.
1589000	1591000	It could go one of two ways.
1591000	1593000	When women are great, we're fantastic communicators,
1593000	1595000	good at multitasking.
1595000	1596000	I know we're not finished.
1596000	1599000	I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.
1599000	1601000	So give me a break, please.
1601000	1604000	I'm not saying that, I'm just saying you haven't finished, that's all.
1604000	1605000	Right.
1605000	1606000	When a group of women are bad,
1606000	1609000	it's bitchy and backstabbing and really nasty.
1609000	1611000	Well, you're not here for the team any more,
1611000	1612000	you're here for yourself.
1612000	1614000	Are you trying to start an argument?
1614000	1615000	I'm asking, that's what you're saying.
1615000	1617000	You are trying to start an argument.
1617000	1619000	I think I've done quite well to hold my tongue,
1619000	1622000	because I could have called her a fucking stupid cunt.
1622000	1624000	Like I wanted to.
1624000	1627000	Constantly moaning and grumbling and complaining.
1627000	1629000	I think, oh, God, if you all do my head in.
1629000	1632000	If anything's going to make me leave this island,
1632000	1634000	it's the people.
1634000	1636000	It's the lack of team work.
1636000	1640000	I think my major achievement was actually not hitting anybody.
1642000	1645000	I think one of my concerns for you guys right at the beginning
1645000	1647000	is that, you know, you're such diverse people.
1647000	1650000	When the gloves are off because you're tired, you're hungry,
1650000	1652000	from my experience, I can be quite explosive.
1652000	1653000	And that is hard.
1653000	1655000	I don't know, you liked an argument, didn't you, Vic?
1655000	1656000	Did I?
1656000	1658000	I don't remember any of that.
1660000	1663000	I was taking the bones out so we can use them for the next meal.
1663000	1665000	All that was left to do with that soup was stir it.
1665000	1667000	How difficult can stirring soup be?
1667000	1671000	Because you are in such an extreme environment,
1671000	1675000	tiny, tiny little things are going to get you agitated.
1675000	1678000	To some it would look like you didn't want to do the harder job.
1678000	1681000	I would say, fuck you to that person, that's what I'd say.
1681000	1684000	And I was just like, guys, you're arguing about fucking soup.
1684000	1685000	You know what I mean?
1685000	1687000	Just let's fucking calm down, eh?
1687000	1689000	There's no need to be like this.
1689000	1691000	I really do think that this experience
1691000	1694000	is the ultimate pressure cooker environment.
1694000	1697000	Living in close quarters like this, it's inevitable.
1697000	1699000	You're going to get conflict.
1700000	1702000	When there's a little bit too much pressure, you need to let it off.
1702000	1705000	You need to have a good swear or a shout or fall out with somebody.
1705000	1709000	Whether you're right or wrong, it's better.
1709000	1710000	It's better.
1711000	1715000	But listen, Victor, I'm sure it won't be our last little lock on the horns,
1715000	1716000	but no hard feelings, mate.
1716000	1719000	Not much weather, fella, not much weather.
1719000	1724000	If left unchecked, tensions among the men could have torn the group apart,
1724000	1728000	but they came up with their own novel way of dealing with conflict.
1728000	1733000	We've had our morning meetings and in that we've had a beef section.
1733000	1737000	If anyone has a problem, it's aired to the group, in front of the group,
1737000	1739000	and talked about like adults.
1739000	1740000	As a result, I think we can all say,
1740000	1742000	there's been the odd tiff here and there,
1742000	1744000	but nothing more than the lover's quarrel.
1746000	1748000	Anyone got any beef?
1748000	1751000	What's important is that grievances don't fester.
1751000	1753000	If you can shine the light on what you're finding difficult,
1753000	1754000	it tends to go away.
1754000	1756000	Good way to start the day.
1756000	1758000	Do you think we're getting everything off our chest and everything like that?
1758000	1759000	Do you think it's working?
1759000	1761000	Don't want any beef stewing.
1762000	1765000	Is that why you wanted to emcee, just for that jaw?
1765000	1766000	That was it?
1766000	1767000	I've been thinking about this all night.
1767000	1768000	I thought so.
1770000	1773000	The women devised an altogether different approach
1773000	1775000	to healing rifts in the group.
1775000	1777000	Island therapy.
1777000	1779000	I'll start.
1779000	1782000	Bea, I feel like your positivity is something
1782000	1784000	that I've never come across before.
1784000	1787000	I am so fond of you, Jules, and I think you're hilarious.
1787000	1789000	It's cringe.
1789000	1793000	One of the most important qualities is actually kindness.
1793000	1796000	You know, and it's not something you necessarily immediately think
1796000	1799000	is critical to a survivor, but you live with someone for six weeks,
1799000	1801000	and those sort of conditions,
1801000	1804000	boy, are you grateful for the person who's kind.
1804000	1808000	Becky, I think you are absolutely wonderful.
1808000	1810000	Maybe we didn't always perfectly get along.
1810000	1813000	There were times where I'd quite like to have gouged their eyes out
1813000	1815000	or stabbed them in the face,
1815000	1818000	but I will always have experienced that with them,
1818000	1821000	so forever we'll have this amazing bond.
1821000	1824000	Harvey, all that time we spent in the jungle together,
1824000	1826000	I couldn't have got through it without you.
1826000	1828000	You were so positive.
1828000	1829000	I'm so sorry.
1829000	1831000	I'm not used to it!
1836000	1839000	Arriving on the island with little more than the clothes they stood up in,
1839000	1842000	the island's beaches were a rich source of materials
1842000	1844000	for the castaways to put to good use.
1844000	1846000	What's this? Yes!
1846000	1847000	Look at that.
1847000	1850000	Not the cleanest teacup in the world.
1850000	1852000	I'm sure we can give it a wash for them.
1852000	1854000	That is amazing!
1854000	1857000	A metal can that we can boil stuff in.
1857000	1858000	Look what I've found.
1858000	1860000	An unopened can of ginger ale.
1860000	1861000	No!
1861000	1863000	And it's in date as well.
1863000	1864000	Oh, my God.
1864000	1867000	One thing that always staggers me with these desert islands,
1867000	1868000	however remote they are,
1868000	1872000	is just the amount of trash you often see washed up on the beaches.
1873000	1875000	Discarded rubbish offered an opportunity
1875000	1878000	to make life on the islands a little more comfortable.
1878000	1880000	Hey, lads, look.
1880000	1882000	Found a pink pear.
1883000	1885000	Look at these bad boys.
1885000	1886000	This is the male version.
1886000	1887000	LAUGHTER
1888000	1889000	What's this?
1889000	1890000	Oh, yes.
1890000	1891000	Lovely toothbrush.
1891000	1892000	That is brilliant.
1892000	1893000	That is brilliant.
1893000	1894000	Oh!
1894000	1897000	I've got a pink, kind of 14-year-old girl's toothbrush.
1897000	1899000	Where else would you do that?
1899000	1902000	You take a little bit of burnt wood and stick it in your mouth
1902000	1905000	and then a washed-up toothbrush you've found.
1905000	1906000	LAUGHTER
1906000	1908000	But it was effective, actually.
1908000	1909000	It was very effective.
1909000	1910000	It was very effective.
1910000	1911000	It was very effective.
1911000	1912000	It was very effective.
1912000	1913000	It was very effective.
1913000	1914000	It was very effective.
1914000	1915000	It was very effective.
1915000	1916000	It was very effective.
1916000	1917000	It was very effective.
1917000	1918000	It was very effective.
1918000	1921000	Oh, my goodness.
1922000	1924000	I found me a hair clip!
1925000	1931000	I now have a collection of hair clips from the island.
1932000	1933000	Another comb!
1933000	1935000	Wide tooth!
1935000	1936000	Very important.
1939000	1942000	The women used scavenged items to turn their camp
1942000	1944000	into a home away from home
1944000	1946000	and even created an island hair salon.
1946000	1947000	And now...
1947000	1949000	Bear, don't look too scared.
1949000	1951000	LAUGHTER
1951000	1952000	This is where...
1952000	1954000	This is where I'm quite out of my comfort zone.
1954000	1957000	Bear, when you threw me into that sea,
1957000	1959000	I was out of my comfort zone!
1959000	1960000	LAUGHTER
1960000	1964000	If it wasn't for all the treasures that the sea brought us,
1964000	1968000	I'm not sure we would have been able to do as much as we did.
1968000	1969000	LAUGHTER
1969000	1970000	Jungle headband.
1970000	1972000	That's good, that's a bit more Rambo.
1972000	1973000	It's quite...
1973000	1975000	You survived my territory,
1975000	1976000	and I've now survived yours.
1976000	1978000	LAUGHTER
1984000	1986000	In this hostile environment,
1986000	1990000	the castaways were putting their lives in danger on a daily basis.
1990000	1994000	There's no doubt with this experiment this island was not benign.
1994000	1996000	Oh, God!
1996000	1997000	What the fuck was that?
1997000	1999000	Something just fucked me.
1999000	2001000	It's a scorpion, guys!
2002000	2005000	Everything on the island was dangerous.
2005000	2008000	There was nothing safe.
2008000	2011000	They faced starvation, dehydration...
2011000	2013000	You're so weak!
2013000	2015000	..and exhaustion.
2015000	2020000	And it was inevitable, over six weeks, that there would be injuries.
2020000	2022000	Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.
2022000	2025000	She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.
2025000	2026000	Especially in the blistered area.
2026000	2029000	The first thing that went through my head when the water can exploded was,
2029000	2031000	gosh, that is hot.
2031000	2032000	And then the second thing was,
2032000	2034000	oh, my God, I don't want to leave the island.
2034000	2036000	I'm still standing.
2036000	2038000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2038000	2040000	So, if you can see there, you OK?
2040000	2042000	Yeah, yeah, I feel a little bit faint.
2042000	2044000	You look ever so slightly peaky.
2045000	2047000	OK, so don't look, Bex.
2047000	2049000	Just don't you dare look.
2049000	2051000	In case of a serious medical emergency,
2051000	2055000	I had a rapid-response team on a 24-hour standby.
2057000	2059000	But the islander still felt vulnerable.
2059000	2062000	She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.
2062000	2063000	Oh, my God.
2064000	2065000	Oh, my God.
2070000	2072000	I definitely worried for my life on the island.
2072000	2074000	Like, genuinely, after the collapse, then I realised,
2074000	2076000	yes, we have a support team,
2076000	2078000	but it does take them a while to get to us.
2078000	2081000	So, yeah, we need to be careful.
2081000	2084000	I just got off and I saw everything went black.
2087000	2089000	What happens when you extend the amount of time
2089000	2091000	that they're trying to survive for,
2091000	2093000	you up the risk ratio exponentially.
2094000	2097000	You know, cos now you're making decisions when you're tired,
2097000	2099000	you're dehydrated, you're starving,
2099000	2102000	and so much can happen in those last few weeks.
2105000	2106000	Be careful!
2114000	2116000	Babe, babe, babe, babe!
2116000	2118000	Any incident is a serious incident
2118000	2120000	when you're playing around with Mother Nature.
2120000	2122000	The power of the water...
2122000	2124000	Ah! Ah-ha! You OK? You OK?
2124000	2126000	OK.
2126000	2129000	Oh, shit!
2129000	2131000	It was a hell of a fall.
2131000	2133000	See that? Yeah.
2133000	2135000	That is almost... Oh, that's tendon.
2137000	2140000	It was so close to the end, to making it,
2140000	2142000	but it wasn't to be, you know.
2144000	2146000	Once evacuated from the island,
2146000	2149000	cameraman Will was flown to the nearest hospital.
2152000	2153000	The plastic surgeon,
2153000	2155000	has done an awesome job.
2155000	2158000	I had cut through a muscle
2158000	2160000	that controlled the wrist,
2160000	2162000	so I'm going to have a good scar.
2162000	2163000	Erm...
2163000	2164000	But...
2164000	2165000	I don't know. Yeah.
2165000	2166000	Everything's fine.
2168000	2171000	Whoa! Look at that!
2171000	2173000	Carbs and veg!
2176000	2178000	The smell...
2178000	2180000	Honestly, it's like nothing else.
2180000	2182000	It's absolutely heartbreaking.
2182000	2184000	To have not made it to the end.
2185000	2187000	This kind of makes up a great little bit.
2188000	2190000	After six weeks on the island,
2190000	2194000	ten men and ten women made it through to the end.
2194000	2196000	And now having survived...
2197000	2199000	Looks like a tornado!
2199000	2201000	That is terrifying!
2201000	2204000	..they were about to return to civilisation.
2204000	2207000	OK, come on, then, give us your highs and lows.
2207000	2210000	Literally, just to get to the end
2210000	2212000	and finally be watching the sunrise
2212000	2214000	of what will be my last day on the island,
2214000	2216000	that was just overwhelming.
2216000	2218000	We got past strangers, we got past friends,
2218000	2220000	and we became family.
2220000	2222000	Really do feel like you can conquer anything
2222000	2223000	when you're all together.
2223000	2225000	When we're going back home, what is there to stop us?
2225000	2227000	Nothing else can really stand in our way.
2227000	2229000	You know, you've got light in your eyes
2229000	2231000	and it's in all of you.
2231000	2233000	And you only get that glint
2233000	2234000	when you go through the mill,
2234000	2235000	come out the other side of it.
2238000	2239000	Guys, I think you're amazing.
2239000	2242000	It's time to get you off this island.
2242000	2244000	Yeah!
2244000	2245000	Let's go, boys.
2245000	2246000	Yeah!
2247000	2249000	So Bear dropped us off on this island
2249000	2251000	and it's just a random island.
2252000	2253000	Bear then come back
2253000	2256000	and he was picking me up off our island.
2256000	2258000	And it was such a strange sensation
2258000	2260000	and I think quite a lot of the other lads felt like that as well,
2260000	2262000	like that was our ground now.
2264000	2265000	Whoo, boys!
2265000	2268000	Return to civilisation was weird.
2268000	2271000	You spent a lot of the time wishing for that day to come
2271000	2273000	and dreaming about it and being like,
2273000	2275000	when that boat turns up, it's going to be amazing.
2275000	2277000	Oh, we did it, guys!
2277000	2279000	But then the reality was I wasn't ready.
2279000	2281000	I wanted to stay.
2281000	2284000	I wanted to stay with these amazing women
2284000	2287000	and living in this amazing experience.
2287000	2288000	Well done, boys.
2288000	2290000	Well done.
2290000	2292000	Let's grab a tackle and get out of here, yeah?
2292000	2294000	Knowing that the time was up
2294000	2296000	and that this great, great, great adventure we were on
2296000	2297000	was coming to an end,
2297000	2299000	that was really sad, that, yeah.
2300000	2303000	I'm so heartened to arrive here
2303000	2307000	and actually see real, genuine love, care and community.
2307000	2310000	And they don't look emaciated and broken.
2310000	2314000	They look actually healthy and smiling and proud.
2314000	2317000	And pride is something that is hard won
2317000	2319000	and they've done it the hard way.
2324000	2326000	Oh, the relief. Absolute relief.
2326000	2330000	Just to know that we were finally going to get back to reality
2330000	2332000	where we can fill our bellies,
2332000	2334000	it was just, yeah, amazing.
2334000	2337000	OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.
2337000	2338000	Yeah!
2338000	2340000	You've done it. You've done it.
2344000	2346000	It's, like, so happy.
2348000	2352000	For the men's arrival, a special welcoming party awaited.
2352000	2353000	In they come.
2353000	2355000	In the form of injured cameraman Will.
2356000	2357000	Will you?
2360000	2362000	I could see all their faces on the side of the boat
2362000	2364000	and I kind of gave them a little wave
2364000	2366000	and they all kind of, like, cheered and jumped out,
2366000	2367000	came running over.
2367000	2369000	It's giving me goosebumps now to think of it.
2369000	2371000	Wow, you all stink!
2373000	2375000	It was, you know, it was really good
2375000	2377000	to kind of get the team back together.
2379000	2382000	After spending six weeks cut off from the world...
2382000	2384000	Oh, it's so weird to touch.
2385000	2388000	..re-acclimatising was going to take time.
2390000	2392000	It feels...
2392000	2395000	I'm going to need to train myself.
2395000	2397000	I can't remember how to work it.
2397000	2400000	I knew this was going to happen, I'd forgotten how to work it.
2400000	2402000	It feels so weird!
2402000	2404000	Fucking hell, it looks weird!
2405000	2407000	That first phone call.
2409000	2411000	I was really looking forward to it,
2411000	2413000	but not the emotional rollercoaster that I knew was going to come.
2413000	2416000	I mean, purely speaking to my missus just pushed me over the edge.
2416000	2418000	Never, never been like that in my life that I can remember
2418000	2421000	other than being a kid sobbing over bugger all.
2421000	2423000	Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.
2423000	2425000	My bit of squeeze on the phone, it was lovely.
2425000	2427000	It was really nice.
2429000	2431000	Hello, baby!
2431000	2434000	I'm so happy to talk to you, I cannot tell you.
2434000	2436000	Do I say good to hear your voice?
2436000	2440000	It was so strange and weird and intense
2440000	2442000	and I really loved it.
2443000	2445000	I really loved it.
2446000	2450000	I didn't realise that when I spoke to my mum and heard her voice,
2450000	2452000	just how powerful that was.
2452000	2454000	Hello?
2457000	2458000	Mum!
2458000	2460000	Is that Mummy?
2460000	2462000	Yeah.
2462000	2464000	Oh, Mummy!
2464000	2466000	I wasn't upset, I was just so happy.
2466000	2468000	I've never been so happy.
2468000	2470000	My mum's pissed me off since being back.
2470000	2472000	She's annoying, but, you know, I'm not going to try and forget that.
2473000	2475000	I'm going to take that moment with a phone call
2475000	2477000	because, actually, you realise that she's not annoying,
2477000	2479000	she's the best.
2479000	2481000	Hello?
2481000	2483000	Hello!
2483000	2487000	Hearing my daughter's voice after six weeks was just beautiful.
2487000	2491000	Oh, baby, I've missed you so much!
2491000	2495000	And kind of made me realise what I have,
2495000	2498000	how rich my, kind of, life at home is.
2498000	2501000	The truth is, you cannot go on this island, endure,
2501000	2504000	and leave the island the same person.
2504000	2507000	It is a life-transforming experience.
2509000	2510000	Oh, my God!
2510000	2513000	After being stripped of all modern comforts,
2513000	2517000	the men and the women had an appreciation for the simplest things.
2517000	2519000	Oh!
2519000	2522000	Returning to the civilisation was really weird.
2522000	2524000	Whoo!
2524000	2527000	I got sort of visual indigestion.
2527000	2529000	Oh!
2529000	2531000	Oh!
2531000	2533000	Oh, my God!
2533000	2534000	Look at this!
2534000	2536000	Get in front of the shower and everything!
2536000	2537000	Get in the toilet!
2537000	2539000	Oh, isn't it beautiful?
2539000	2541000	I can't get over how beautiful it is!
2541000	2543000	Argh!
2543000	2545000	Oh!
2545000	2547000	Fucking hell!
2547000	2549000	Oh, God!
2549000	2552000	No way!
2552000	2554000	Everything that you totally took for granted
2554000	2557000	is suddenly the most amazing thing.
2557000	2559000	Oh, my God!
2559000	2560000	Argh!
2560000	2563000	You know, we're a few months on now,
2563000	2565000	and I'm still just so grateful of everything.
2565000	2566000	Every silly thing.
2566000	2568000	Sitting on a chair, you know.
2568000	2570000	Where does that chair come from?
2570000	2571000	It's amazing.
2571000	2573000	I can't believe I'm talking about a chair.
2573000	2575000	Wow!
2575000	2577000	Yay!
2577000	2578000	That looks great.
2578000	2581000	After weeks of surviving on very little food,
2581000	2584000	the men and the women were given a strict diet to follow
2584000	2586000	to allow their bodies time to recover.
2586000	2587000	Wow!
2587000	2588000	The starter.
2588000	2589000	That better be the starter. Yeah.
2589000	2593000	We were instructed that we would be given a meal plan,
2593000	2597000	and I thought the meal plan would have been a lot bigger.
2597000	2598000	It's so good.
2598000	2599000	It's so good.
2599000	2601000	I just wish it was four times as big.
2601000	2603000	Just can't get it in quick enough.
2603000	2604000	Oh, my God.
2604000	2606000	Oh!
2606000	2607000	Want more food?
2607000	2608000	Six.
2610000	2614000	I have secret videos of me and Belinda
2614000	2618000	when we got off the island scoffing Mars bars and drinking beer.
2618000	2620000	Oh!
2620000	2622000	Have a crisp.
2622000	2624000	How are they?
2628000	2631000	That night when I come off the island,
2631000	2633000	I went against the rules
2633000	2636000	and I ate, I think, two or three steaks,
2636000	2638000	pina coladas, beers.
2638000	2640000	I went to town.
2640000	2642000	That night, I went to bed,
2642000	2644000	three o'clock in the morning,
2644000	2647000	it was like someone had opened up a tap in my arse,
2647000	2650000	and I never got off the toilet until about ten o'clock the next day.
2650000	2652000	I think I lost about six stone in one sitting.
2659000	2662000	I think what I gained from the island
2662000	2666000	was a sense that the human spirit is unbreakable.
2666000	2667000	Yes!
2667000	2669000	It made me feel fantastic.
2669000	2671000	I was 25 again.
2671000	2673000	For six weeks, it was great.
2673000	2674000	Fantastic.
2674000	2675000	Thank you.
2675000	2676000	I am not alone.
2676000	2679000	I am not the same person who went to the island.
2679000	2681000	I was really shy.
2681000	2683000	I was just scared of what people would make of me.
2683000	2686000	But the island, it helped me find friends,
2686000	2688000	like, lifelong friends.
2689000	2691000	I think we had an amazing bond.
2691000	2694000	We've shared experience of that,
2694000	2696000	which we'll keep for the rest of our lives.
2696000	2698000	She floats!
2698000	2700000	What? They've made her out?
2702000	2704000	It's that feeling of living on the edge
2704000	2706000	and living in the extremes.
2706000	2708000	But still being really happy.
2708000	2710000	That's what amazed me the most.
2710000	2712000	100% I would do it again.
2712000	2713000	I loved it.
2715000	2717000	I think, probably, the experience of the island,
2717000	2720000	for me, was life-changing
2720000	2723000	and incredibly humbling.
2723000	2726000	I just think it's the best thing I've ever done.
2726000	2727000	Full stop.
2729000	2732000	Seeing them at the end, proud of what they've done,
2732000	2735000	tight as a group, actually is inspiring.
2735000	2738000	And, ultimately, they learned, never give up.
2738000	2740000	Every single one of them said that.
2740000	2742000	They said, this is about just being bloody-minded
2742000	2744000	and not giving up and sticking with it.
2744000	2747000	And, really, that's the heart of a great survivor.
