0	13000	Two uninhabited Pacific Islands, more than 5,000 miles from the UK.
13000	20280	One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British
20280	21280	women.
21280	30120	When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power or mental strength
30120	31120	that wins the day?
31120	35280	Who will have what it takes to stay alive?
35280	44000	Tonight, we follow the women.
44000	50400	In 21st century Britain, old-fashioned ideas about men and women have disappeared, and
50400	51260	traditional gender roles have disappeared.
51260	58260	Women are often expected to do it all, combining childcare with excelling at work.
58260	62120	Don't let that happen again, I don't know who's doing it, it's really, really embarrassing
62120	63120	and unprofessional.
63120	68080	But if stripped of all of the advantages of modern life, are multitasking 21st century
68080	72600	women better cut out for survival than men?
72600	79000	To find out, I'm abandoning 14 ordinary women to fend for themselves on a remote desert
79000	79500	island.
81260	93120	They will be utterly alone.
93120	95120	Filming everything themselves.
95120	97120	Right, you're filming me, filming you.
97120	99120	That is the biggest shark I've ever seen.
102120	103120	They'll have to hunt for food...
103120	105120	You're all right, you are.
105120	106120	..for water...
106120	108120	Yeah, it's collecting water now.
108120	109120	..and for shelter.
109120	112120	Oh, for f***'s sake.
114120	118120	The women will be taken to the very edge of existence...
118120	119120	Ah!
119120	121120	..living on the island for six weeks
121120	123120	in the middle of tropical storm season.
127120	128120	It's like a tornado.
128120	130120	That is terrifying.
131120	134120	We need a radio and medic now.
134120	136120	It's not a programme, it's just f***ing ridiculous.
136120	140120	Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?
140120	142120	And leave it there.
142120	144120	When pitted against the extremes of nature...
146120	150120	..have these Monday women got what it takes to survive.
151120	153120	Guys!
153120	155120	That is a big f***.
166120	169120	People hold a lot of their self-worth in things like money,
169120	171120	what they're able to buy, what car they have,
171120	174120	what clothes they have, make-up, how beautiful they are.
174120	176120	When all of that's gone on the island,
176120	179120	I think it all comes down to what sort of a person you are.
179120	181120	I think you can be slightly different.
181120	183120	You can be slightly mental to want to do this, right?
183120	185120	I think you've got to be slightly off your tree.
185120	188120	As human beings, it's the closest we're going to come to a reboot.
188120	191120	I'm about to abandon 14 British women
191120	194120	on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.
195120	198120	I want my daughter to know that her mum is actually quite brave
198120	202120	and she's not just this person that's there to make tea.
202120	205120	I want to show her that you can do anything.
205120	209120	I'm really looking forward to going back to the hunter-gatherer,
209120	210120	our animalistic roots,
210120	212120	and finding your own food.
212120	215120	I think it's only by pushing yourself to these extremes
215120	218120	that you get to find out who you truly are.
218120	220120	These are ordinary women
220120	223120	with no previous experience of surviving in the wild.
223120	226120	I'm not going on because I can kill an animal
226120	228120	and I know I can survive and I can chop down trees.
228120	231120	I'm doing this because I can't.
231120	233120	But I'm eager to see if I can.
233120	234120	It's the adventure.
234120	236120	There's so much I haven't seen.
236120	238120	There's so much I haven't done.
238120	239120	I'm running out of time.
239120	241120	And I might be running out of health.
244120	246120	How fast are we going right now?
246120	247120	About 30 knots.
247120	249120	We can go really fast if you want.
253120	256120	I think people often think that to be good at adventure or survival,
256120	258120	you've got to have big muscles.
258120	261120	But actually, in the battle to stay alive,
261120	264120	it's one in here and in here, not on these.
266120	267120	Currently on the island,
267120	268120	all of us girls,
268120	271120	I think we will not only survive,
271120	272120	but I think we'll thrive.
275120	276120	This is your island.
276120	277120	Straight ahead.
279120	282120	There's no beach!
286120	289120	There are a lot of currents around this, OK?
289120	292120	So I'm going to try and find little areas of slack water
292120	293120	to get you in.
295120	297120	Unpredictable riptides and hidden rocks
297120	299120	make these waters treacherous.
301120	304120	This is the closest I can get the boat to the shoreline.
305120	307120	I'm not going to sugarcoat this for you guys.
307120	309120	It is going to be hard.
309120	311120	It's going to be hard physically.
311120	313120	It's going to be hard emotionally.
313120	315120	And the thing to remember is positivity,
315120	318120	positivity, positivity.
320120	324120	It's not the white beaches and the sun that we were daydreaming of.
324120	325120	I was OK until I got to this point,
325120	328120	and now I'm really panicking.
329120	330120	Hey!
330120	331120	How deep is that?
331120	333120	You know, it is going to be out of your depth.
333120	334120	There are rocks in there.
334120	335120	Just be smart.
336120	337120	To get to the island,
337120	339120	the women have no choice but to swim to the shore
339120	341120	in the clothes they're wearing.
342120	344120	It's the thought of being all night
344120	347120	with no dry clothes and no fire,
347120	349120	cos we have to make mistakes.
349120	350120	Don't think about it.
350120	351120	Don't think about it.
351120	352120	Just one by one.
352120	354120	It's going to take hours.
354120	356120	We'll just cuddle each other tonight.
356120	357120	Yeah.
357120	358120	Everyone's allowed the old wind.
358120	359120	Once we get you in the water,
359120	360120	you'll be done with it.
360120	361120	Yeah.
361120	362120	Yeah?
362120	363120	Then it's all in front of you.
363120	365120	It's all uphill from here.
365120	366120	You'll be great.
366120	367120	You'll be great.
368120	370120	It's all uphill from here.
370120	371120	Yeah.
371120	372120	You're good to go.
378120	379120	Let's go for it.
380120	382120	The women take with them bags and cases
382120	383120	containing their filming equipment
383120	385120	and medical supplies.
386120	388120	This is croc territory.
388120	391120	Let's get you out of the water as fast as we can.
393120	394120	OK, let's go.
401120	404120	From this moment on, they'll be completely alone.
404120	405120	Who are you?
405120	406120	George.
406120	407120	George. Excellent.
407120	408120	Becky.
408120	409120	Becky. Hi, Becky.
409120	410120	Happy.
410120	411120	Ah!
413120	414120	It's so nice to meet you.
414120	415120	I'm Harveller.
415120	416120	Nice to meet you.
416120	417120	What do you do?
417120	418120	I'm a psychotherapist.
418120	419120	Oh, my God!
419120	420120	Yeah!
420120	421120	Belinda.
421120	422120	I'm Jamie.
422120	423120	Jamie.
423120	424120	Nice to meet you.
424120	425120	What's your name?
425120	426120	Ah, Becky.
426120	427120	Hello.
427120	428120	Belinda.
428120	429120	Well, that was suitably chaotic.
429120	430120	You know, it's 4 o'clock.
430120	431120	It's going to get dark here in a couple of hours.
431120	432120	And already, you know, there have been 15 minutes
432120	433120	of chat, chat, chat on the beach.
433120	434120	They need to work hard, get moving.
434120	435120	But, yeah.
435120	436120	It's so nice to meet you.
436120	437120	Thank you.
437120	438120	Thank you.
438120	439120	Thank you.
439120	440120	Thank you.
440120	441120	Thank you.
441120	442120	Thank you.
442120	443120	But, yeah.
443120	444120	There's nothing I can do.
444120	446120	These are things they're going to find out.
446120	450120	It's time for me and the crew to leave.
450120	453120	We won't be back till the end of the experiment.
453120	454120	Oh!
454120	456120	I am peeing!
456120	457120	I'm peeing!
457120	458120	I'm peeing!
458120	459120	I'm peeing!
459120	460120	Oh!
460120	461120	I still need to pee.
461120	464120	I don't know if I want to pee through my trousers.
464120	465120	Oh, boy.
465120	466120	I don't know.
466120	467120	Drop them.
467120	469120	The women's home for the next six weeks
469120	472120	is this remote, uninhabited beach.
472120	477580	Pacific Island. To make sure they have a fighting chance of survival, I've ensured
477580	483040	there is enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation to keep them alive. But
483040	488440	only if they have the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it. I've dropped the
488440	493060	group in the most inhospitable part of the island. There's unforgiving jungle and
493060	498620	deadly creatures all around. Now just two hours before sunset, the group need to
498620	506180	move away as quickly as they can. Are you still weeing, Jade? I'm weeing. I need to find that peaceful moment where I can actually weee.
506180	512020	The thing is I'm weeing. And then I push more and I'm weeing more. I think it's because I've held it in for so long.
512020	519620	Guys, it's really dense up here so we need to get moving. We're just gonna try and take all the kit up this slope basically.
519620	524620	Bring it up because I think the tide's coming in and then try and find some way to fucking sleep.
524620	526620	Can you take this camera of course?
526620	528620	All of the women will be filming.
528620	533620	But four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.
533620	537620	They'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.
537620	541620	Please, could you just push me at my back? No, it's my weight. I can't get it up.
541620	544620	Here. Wait. That's it. That's what I needed.
544620	549620	The women have no food and just one day's supply of drinking water.
551620	554620	We need a decent place to sleep tonight because it's nearly dark.
554620	557620	We're not gonna have it here. We actually need to go. We really do.
558620	560620	All right, who wants to carve the way?
560620	568620	To stand any chance of surviving, they've been provided with three knives, three machetes and some basic fishing equipment.
568620	572620	Anybody that's using a knife, just tell us. Don't whack it out.
574620	577620	Guys, are we going right or straight?
577620	579620	Guys, should we get together and have a chat?
579620	580620	Well, let's ask her.
580620	582620	Shall we come up? There's a clearing.
582620	587620	With little daylight left, the group's priority must be to find a safe place to camp and quickly.
588620	591620	We can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.
591620	593620	100%. 100%.
593620	597620	Do you want to lead the way? Make a decision. You lead the way.
597620	600620	Anywhere you think looks the clearest, we'll follow you.
600620	606620	I'm not going that way, right? It's more dense and the light is through over here, so I want to go over here.
606620	609620	Guys, be really careful when you come in on this trail.
609620	611620	I'm still going up.
611620	613620	Keep going. Keep going.
613620	615620	Need to get the fuck out.
615620	616620	What?
616620	617620	Oh!
617620	618620	Stay still. We've got dinner.
618620	619620	Oh, my God.
619620	620620	What is it?
620620	621620	Snake.
623620	624620	It's right near me.
624620	626620	A huge fucking snake came towards me.
626620	627620	It's fine.
627620	629620	I think what you need to do...
629620	630620	Fucking hell.
630620	632620	Right, it's going up the tree, girls.
632620	634620	Shall I just chop its head off?
634620	636620	It came right at me.
636620	638620	What? What, its head?
638620	640620	And it came straight towards me.
640620	642620	And then we stood on it.
642620	644620	That's why I ran away.
644620	646620	Oh, fuck.
647620	649620	I'm going to fucking die on this island.
649620	652620	You're not going to die. You are not going to die.
652620	654620	It came right towards me like that.
654620	657620	Just breathe slowly and walk up to me now.
657620	659620	How am I going to sleep in this island?
659620	660620	Come on. What's her name?
660620	661620	Jamie.
661620	662620	Jamie, come to me.
662620	663620	Oh, my God.
663620	664620	Just come to me.
664620	665620	Right, I'll come to you.
668620	670620	To be honest, I'm frightened of everything.
670620	675620	Bogs and snakes and crocodiles and sharks.
675620	679620	But I really, really want to overcome the fear.
681620	685620	Materialistic things really shouldn't matter.
685620	689620	But, unfortunately, they do matter a lot to me.
689620	692620	I can't imagine what it's going to be like
692620	695620	going back to complete and utter basics.
695620	699620	It might change me into a new woman completely.
699620	700620	I have no idea.
700620	702620	Oh, I was on an island for two minutes
702620	704620	and a snake attacked me. Fuck me.
704620	706620	I don't want a snake coming towards me.
706620	708620	Take a deep breath, please.
708620	709620	OK.
709620	710620	Just in.
710620	711620	Just stand still.
711620	712620	And breathe in.
712620	713620	Right.
713620	714620	And breathe out.
714620	715620	It's not going to get you.
715620	717620	It looks like it's bloody coming.
717620	720620	It's bloody not. Stop fucking looking for it.
720620	724620	So, basically, the whole place is crawling with snakes.
724620	725620	Go on. Move on.
727620	728620	Keep moving.
728620	730620	I want to get out of here.
730620	733620	When you're pushing through dense jungle into the unknown,
733620	735620	everything is a potential threat.
735620	737620	You've got caiman crocodiles, you've got snakes,
737620	738620	you've got wild pigs,
738620	742620	all of which are most likely to attack when they're surprised.
742620	743620	You let your guard down,
743620	747620	the wild is going to bite you on the backside hard.
747620	749620	I feel like everything's crawling on me.
749620	750620	It's not.
750620	752620	You've got to try and just take your mind away
752620	754620	and just pretend you're walking through some lovely area
754620	757620	of a botanical garden.
757620	759620	Oh, shit, there's a yucca.
759620	760620	Oh, wow.
760620	761620	Right in front of us.
761620	762620	Look.
762620	764620	Look.
764620	766620	We've got a yucca.
766620	769620	Guys, we need to get our priorities straight.
769620	770620	It's an early win.
770620	774620	They've identified a valuable source of carbohydrate.
774620	776620	We're getting too excited about yucca.
776620	779620	I'm actually quite concerned about sleeping not yucca.
781620	782620	This is nuts.
782620	784620	I didn't know places like this existed.
785620	787620	Oh, my hair.
787620	788620	It's caught on fire.
788620	789620	I hear more spikes.
789620	791620	Guys, there's spikes on this that you can't even see.
791620	793620	We're getting denser.
793620	795620	Is everybody happy to continue through this?
795620	797620	Well, um...
797620	800620	I think we need to think about how much sunlight we have left.
800620	802620	If I have to, I'll walk through the dark
802620	805620	because I am not sleeping here because of that snake.
805620	806620	I'm with you on that one.
806620	807620	I don't know what else is here.
807620	809620	With light running out fast,
809620	813620	the women are no closer to finding a beach to set up camp.
813620	817620	Guys, where we just stopped, where there is quite a big open space,
817620	819620	this might be a good place to just base.
819620	820620	Let's do it.
820620	821620	Right.
823620	826620	I really, really do feel like I want to get out of this area
826620	830620	because I feel like we've made absolutely zero progress.
830620	832620	Let's get out of here.
832620	836620	It's really making me quite anxious and stressing me out.
836620	840620	14 British women have been abandoned on a remote Pacific island
840620	844620	with nothing but the closest stand-up in and a few basic tools.
844620	846620	Sorry, tree.
848620	850620	What I want to find out is,
850620	854620	has all of this cushioning that civilisation has experienced,
854620	858620	has it made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct
858620	860620	that I believe is deep within us all?
860620	862620	OK.
862620	864620	With night closing in,
864620	867620	the women have decided to abandon their search for a beach
867620	869620	and set up camp in the jungle,
869620	872620	taking their chances with the deadly critters.
872620	873620	Strength is the key.
873620	875620	Strength isn't an outward thing.
875620	876620	It's an inner thing.
876620	877620	It's an inner quality.
877620	879620	And whether you're a man or a woman, you can have that.
879620	882620	It's about how you react to the hardship.
893620	898620	Ring, ring, go away, come again
898620	900620	When we get off there sailing
900620	902620	Just got changed and now it's raining.
902620	903620	Oh, yeah?
903620	905620	I've only got me normal pants.
905620	907620	If the women are to survive,
907620	911620	they'll need to live through six weeks of the tropical storm season.
913620	914620	At its worst,
914620	919620	the torrential rain can dump up to an inch of water in an hour.
919620	922620	My current knickers and trousers are wet through,
922620	925620	so I feel like I've wet myself a bit.
925620	927620	I've been wearing a shitty nappy.
927620	932620	I have dry socks, though, which are in my bra.
932620	934620	Keeping it even drier.
934620	936620	Yeah, that's a good idea.
936620	940620	Without shelter, the only protection the women have from the elements
940620	942620	is their raincoats and ponchos.
942620	944620	It's absolutely hideous.
944620	946620	It's going to get dark soon.
946620	950620	And that will mean that there's no heat at all.
950620	953620	So we will go to bed cold and damp,
953620	956620	and we'll have to sleep on a cold and damp jungle floor.
956620	963620	I've got my fucking hands in my hairdresser.
963620	966620	And, like, I can't afford this.
972620	976620	Do you want to see the water coming out of my socks on film?
976620	978620	Don't worry.
978620	982620	7pm, and the women are determined to get a fire started.
982620	985620	If you can find another tree with some of that, great.
985620	987620	But that will burn very, very quickly.
987620	989620	It's cold and it's horrible.
989620	991620	I'm trying to actually not even think about it.
991620	992620	That's what I'm trying to do at the moment,
992620	995620	just focus on what's going on and not focus about the dark.
995620	999620	Because if we don't get a fire and we sit down, awful.
999620	1001620	After just two days' survival training,
1001620	1005620	Becky, Georgina and their team have made a bow and drill.
1005620	1009620	And we move this really slow and low, Becky.
1009620	1011620	I like it long and I like it slow.
1013620	1015620	Spinning one piece at a time.
1015620	1018620	One piece of wood against another should create enough friction
1018620	1020620	to produce a burning ember.
1020620	1022620	Honestly, who'd be a bloody caveman?
1027620	1029620	We've done it once, we'll do it again.
1029620	1031620	We can do this, girls. We can do it.
1033620	1035620	We're all so desperate to make fire
1035620	1038620	and the conditions are just so wet.
1038620	1041620	I just have a feeling we're going to stay up all night
1041620	1043620	and try and make fire.
1043620	1044620	Any smoke?
1045620	1048620	How long do you think the girls have been at it now?
1048620	1052620	Three hours, maybe more than three hours.
1052620	1054620	These women I'm with are amazing.
1054620	1058620	I've gone from absolutely terrified
1058620	1063620	to sheer thrill and enjoyment.
1063620	1065620	Oh, there's tons of smoke.
1065620	1067620	It's like a frigging wigwam.
1067620	1069620	Keep going.
1069620	1071620	I don't think I can hold it much longer.
1071620	1072620	Ah!
1075620	1076620	Bloody good ember.
1076620	1078620	We're going for it.
1078620	1080620	Maybe it's going too far on that one.
1082620	1083620	Yes.
1085620	1086620	You're very nearly there.
1086620	1087620	Here we go!
1087620	1088620	Oh, my God!
1088620	1089620	Wow!
1089620	1090620	Do it again, just a little bit more.
1090620	1091620	Oh, my God!
1091620	1092620	Oh, my God!
1099620	1101620	Us women just like to do this by persistence,
1101620	1103620	persistence, persistence.
1103620	1104620	Yeah.
1104620	1107620	Becky and her team's determination has paid off.
1107620	1108620	Not even a little fire.
1108620	1110620	A fucking giant one.
1110620	1112620	After just five hours of trying,
1112620	1115620	these women have achieved what took mankind
1115620	1117620	hundreds of thousands of years.
1117620	1120620	Guys, how are we actually feeling about the fire?
1124620	1126620	But almost more importantly, what it does for the women
1126620	1129620	is going to give them a sense that they're gaining control
1129620	1131620	of their environment.
1131620	1133620	Is everyone stripping off?
1133620	1135620	She's got my dress stuck in my knickers.
1137620	1139620	I don't want to sound too cocky too early.
1139620	1140620	No, I don't think we should.
1140620	1141620	I don't think we should at all.
1141620	1144620	But right now, this is...
1144620	1145620	We're winning.
1150620	1152620	Oh!
1152620	1154620	Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
1154620	1157620	Fucking fuck me!
1157620	1159620	What the fuck is that?
1159620	1160620	What is it?
1160620	1161620	Please tell me that's not a spider.
1161620	1162620	What is it?
1162620	1163620	It's that big crab over there.
1163620	1164620	Can you see it, Jo?
1164620	1167620	Oh, my God, there's no way I can sleep here.
1167620	1170620	Fucking hell!
1170620	1172620	We're not staying here tomorrow.
1172620	1174620	We're all going together, and we're going that way,
1174620	1176620	and we're not going to stop until we find a flaming beach.
1176620	1177620	Oh, no.
1177620	1179620	Lady's got crabs.
1188620	1190620	The women have had a restless first night
1190620	1192620	on the damp jungle floor.
1192620	1194620	I tried to have some sleep,
1194620	1196620	but the noises in the night
1196620	1198620	and the crabs that were creeping up on us,
1198620	1199620	I just couldn't...
1199620	1202620	I just sat up all the time with the torch,
1202620	1204620	the head torch, like that.
1204620	1206620	I did. I woke everybody up with my fart.
1206620	1210620	You did about five or six big, loud ones.
1210620	1212620	Yeah, well, no, no, no, they weren't loud.
1212620	1213620	Oh, no.
1213620	1215620	You just decided to sleep at our party.
1215620	1216620	Walk me up.
1218620	1219620	This is that...
1219620	1221620	It's a yucca,
1221620	1223620	and it's a bit like a potato.
1223620	1226620	Despite lack of sleep, Julie's playing mum
1226620	1229620	and has rustled up a little breakfast.
1229620	1232620	I'm very excited. We've got our first foods.
1232620	1234620	Oh, hang on.
1234620	1236620	Oh, my God.
1236620	1238620	Not as nice as normal food.
1238620	1241620	When we're actually starving, it'll be absolutely amazing.
1241620	1243620	The group may have found food.
1243620	1244620	Add to the collection.
1244620	1246620	What's that?
1246620	1248620	Oh, it's swollen.
1248620	1251620	But during the night, it's the women themselves
1251620	1253620	that are featured on the island menu.
1253620	1255620	Look at my back.
1258620	1260620	I've got, like, a full face of spots,
1260620	1262620	and I can't even, like, wipe my eyes,
1262620	1263620	because my hands are dirty.
1263620	1264620	Look at my nails.
1266620	1268620	Basically, I cannot be dealing with this.
1270620	1274620	One side of me is like, I want to do this, I love nature,
1274620	1275620	I am one with nature,
1275620	1277620	and the other side of me is just like, look at my fucking face.
1277620	1278620	Are you kidding me?
1278620	1280620	You know, what the fuck, right?
1280620	1282620	You always look gorgeous when you're young.
1282620	1283620	You do.
1283620	1284620	Don't be.
1284620	1285620	I think so.
1285620	1286620	No.
1286620	1287620	We're all young.
1287620	1288620	Do you know what?
1288620	1289620	Your boobs are better than mine.
1289620	1290620	Well, mine are false.
1293620	1295620	The urgent priority for the group
1295620	1297620	is to find a safe place to camp,
1297620	1299620	away from the jungle creatures
1299620	1301620	and near a sustainable water source.
1303620	1305620	There's only going to be, what, like, 20 litres of water,
1305620	1308620	and that's not lasting us 14 people for very long.
1312620	1315620	As nice as this camp is, we want to...
1315620	1317620	I am trying to be nice.
1317620	1319620	Go and find the beach.
1319620	1321620	So, one group's going to go look,
1321620	1323620	and one group's going to stay here.
1323620	1324620	Who's in the go group?
1324620	1325620	Can I come?
1325620	1326620	Yeah.
1326620	1327620	Have you got your whistles?
1327620	1328620	Yes, we've whistled us.
1328620	1329620	Hold on a minute.
1329620	1333620	You think that you can walk right round this island in the water?
1333620	1334620	We don't know.
1334620	1335620	I don't know.
1335620	1336620	It's trial and error, isn't it?
1336620	1337620	I don't think so.
1337620	1340620	I think this decision has been made a little too quickly,
1340620	1342620	and I just think we need to plan.
1342620	1343620	Why don't we just stay here
1343620	1345620	for another few hours thinking about it?
1345620	1347620	Or we could go.
1347620	1348620	Are you not coming now?
1348620	1349620	Yeah, I am.
1349620	1350620	Off your butt, then.
1350620	1351620	We're off.
1355620	1357620	I've done the children.
1357620	1358620	I've been mum.
1358620	1359620	I've done my business.
1359620	1363620	I'm at this age now where I need to do something for me.
1363620	1366620	For me, when I was younger, I did want to do certain things,
1366620	1368620	but I never had actually either the balls or the friends
1368620	1369620	to do it with me,
1369620	1371620	and I didn't have enough balls to do it on my own.
1371620	1374620	And now I want to see if I can cope.
1377620	1380620	So do you see if we go to the end of that bit there
1380620	1382620	and see what's around the corner?
1382620	1384620	I wish I had water with me.
1384620	1386620	With nothing to carry it in,
1386620	1389620	Abi and Fran's group set off with no water.
1389620	1391620	I'm really hoping to find a beach,
1391620	1392620	because last night was not good.
1392620	1394620	Because last night was not fun.
1394620	1399620	My body does not like this at all.
1399620	1403620	I hope there's paradise beyond these rocks.
1403620	1407620	Finding a good camp is a key priority.
1407620	1410620	They'll need a base with vital resources close at hand,
1410620	1412620	the sea for food,
1412620	1414620	the materials to build a shelter,
1414620	1416620	and a plentiful water source.
1416620	1419620	Let that be a beach, please.
1419620	1421620	Oh, my God, it's grim.
1422620	1424620	I have a feeling when the tide is high,
1424620	1425620	that disappears.
1425620	1426620	What, the whole of that?
1426620	1427620	I agree.
1427620	1429620	And that's a mangrove there.
1429620	1430620	Yeah.
1430620	1432620	This whole thing's been futile round this side, then.
1432620	1433620	This is shit.
1433620	1435620	What do you want to do?
1435620	1436620	I need to have a drink.
1436620	1440620	So we have a good trek to get back to drink town.
1444620	1446620	I'm, like, shattered.
1446620	1449620	We can't let this island take its toll on us on the second day.
1449620	1451620	It's hot. We don't have water.
1452620	1456620	Just even trekking is a risk right now.
1456620	1458620	The women have left themselves exposed
1458620	1461620	in oppressive 30-degree heat with nothing to drink.
1461620	1463620	I'm sick.
1463620	1465620	I'm going to have to sit down in a minute.
1465620	1466620	I'm going to collapse.
1466620	1469620	It's a long way back to their temporary camp.
1472620	1475620	Guys, we've had a fall.
1475620	1477620	Oh, fuck.
1477620	1479620	OK, don't panic.
1479620	1481620	Shit, no, don't. Are you all right?
1482620	1484620	Oh, shit, no, wait.
1484620	1485620	Sit forward. Sit forward.
1485620	1487620	You've got to sit forward.
1487620	1489620	OK, here we go.
1489620	1491620	Put your head down low. Low, low, low, low, low.
1491620	1492620	Don't let your head burn.
1492620	1493620	I'm so sorry. I know.
1493620	1495620	Would you stop apologising?
1498620	1500620	In temperatures like this,
1500620	1502620	the women have got to drink a lot,
1502620	1505620	between two and four litres of water a day.
1505620	1507620	If they don't, they're finished.
1507620	1509620	Come on, friend.
1509620	1512620	Let's do a little walk.
1514620	1517620	My parents were Iranian, like, very protective,
1517620	1521620	and I have literally lived such a sheltered life.
1521620	1524620	All of the decisions in my life have been made for me.
1524620	1527620	All they ever see is just study and get married.
1528620	1531620	I want to prove that I can be independent,
1531620	1536620	that I can survive and that I can make decisions for myself.
1536620	1538620	Yeah, go back, get a drink.
1538620	1540620	That's it. I just feel like I'm on a bomb.
1545620	1548620	I actually just thought we'd find some idyllic beach within 24 hours,
1548620	1551620	but actually, the reality is we're actually only something like,
1551620	1556620	oh, God, a few hundred metres away from where we jumped out the stupid boat.
1556620	1558620	So, right now, I feel a bit of a failure.
1560620	1563620	I can't believe we can't get out of here.
1563620	1567620	The whole notion of surviving on a tropical island may sound idyllic,
1567620	1572620	but the reality behind the picture postcard fantasy is brutal.
1572620	1574620	It may look like paradise,
1574620	1579620	but trying to survive on an island like that really can be hell on earth.
1582620	1585620	I've been trying to keep these tears in all along.
1585620	1588620	Stop it, Jade. Just try and stop.
1588620	1591620	Just try and stop, cos it'll make you feel worse by crying.
1594620	1596620	That's my friend.
1597620	1600620	It's not great, I'm not gonna lie.
1600620	1602620	Day three on the island.
1602620	1606620	The women have been forced to spend another night of misery in the jungle
1606620	1610620	after failing to find a safe place to camp with a water source.
1610620	1612620	Everybody just needs to find that bloody beach,
1612620	1614620	cos I'm not staying here again tonight.
1614620	1615620	No way.
1618620	1621620	Stop with the tears, because it isn't going to do anything.
1621620	1623620	It's not going to change anything.
1623620	1626620	I think Jade's really struggling with just getting used to...
1626620	1629620	..like, island life, as we all are.
1629620	1632620	I know that sounds really harsh, and I'm not being a bastard,
1632620	1633620	I'm trying not to be, but...
1633620	1635620	No, it's the truth, yeah.
1635620	1637620	I sometimes, with my children, have to just say,
1637620	1640620	''Shut up.'' Do you know what I mean? To pull them round.
1640620	1642620	Can't you channel your anger through somewhere else?
1642620	1644620	Yeah, I'm angry with Bear Grylls.
1644620	1646620	Go with that thought. Yes.
1646620	1648620	Just go with that thought.
1648620	1651620	Yeah, I'm really angry with Bear Grylls.
1657620	1660620	More desperate than ever to get out of the jungle,
1660620	1664620	the women are sending out another search party to find a beach camp.
1664620	1668620	Can we form a circle or something, so we can have a chat?
1668620	1673620	But before they leave, Jade has an announcement to make.
1673620	1676620	I am not prepared for something like this.
1676620	1679620	I'm really, really glad that I've come here,
1679620	1682620	but I don't want to continue.
1682620	1684620	That's perfectly fair.
1684620	1685620	What is it that's tipped you over the edge,
1685620	1688620	that you just can't cope with any more?
1688620	1692620	Everything's wet, even my socks are wet, my shoes are wet.
1692620	1694620	I've got bites all over my hand on my face,
1694620	1696620	and, yeah, they go in, and they might not look as bad.
1696620	1698620	Did you not think that was always going to happen, though,
1698620	1700620	that we were going to get bitten and we were going to get wet?
1700620	1703620	You're wet and you're cold and you're this and you'll go back...
1703620	1705620	And I'm ill. I'm unwell. And you'll have food.
1705620	1707620	I'm unwell. I've been bitten to shit, I'm unwell,
1707620	1710620	and my health comes first, and...
1710620	1712620	If we found the beach today,
1712620	1714620	and if we did find the glorious beach
1714620	1715620	that there is,
1715620	1717620	then things could be so different.
1717620	1719620	I don't know what to say.
1719620	1721620	I know I can see.
1721620	1724620	I don't want to, yeah, and that's all honesty.
1724620	1726620	Put my hands up, you know.
1726620	1729620	Put my shriveled, hanging nail,
1729620	1731620	bitten hands up.
1732620	1734620	Jade, I'm really enjoying the experience,
1734620	1737620	but I don't like that I've been bitten on my face.
1737620	1739620	I look like shit. I'm just looking at myself,
1739620	1741620	and I look like shit.
1741620	1743620	I'm just kind of a bit over it,
1743620	1744620	and it's like, you know, if you don't want to be here,
1744620	1747620	you don't want to be on the edge, fuck off.
1747620	1749620	Unable to persuade Jade to stay...
1749620	1751620	Foxtrot to Bravo.
1751620	1754620	..the women have no choice but to use their emergency sat phone
1754620	1757620	to request her evacuation from the island.
1757620	1761620	I know this is total bitching, but I'm just going to be honest.
1761620	1767620	She comes across really unintelligent.
1767620	1772620	She is not intelligent enough to actually realise
1772620	1773620	what she was getting herself into.
1773620	1775620	Coming on the island.
1775620	1779620	Bye, love. I can't get up. I've got nothing on my feet.
1779620	1782620	After less than 48 hours on the island,
1782620	1785620	hairdresser Jade is making her way to meet the boat
1785620	1788620	that will take her back to civilisation.
1788620	1791620	What's the point of me waxing my bikini?
1791620	1793620	I haven't even shown my legs yet.
1796620	1798620	The truth is, for the women on this island,
1798620	1800620	every single one of them will have a low point.
1800620	1802620	It is just a nature of survival.
1804620	1807620	No! No!
1807620	1810620	This is all about seeing who, in those moments,
1810620	1812620	who rises and who crumbles.
1815620	1818620	Right, everyone take a whistle. Thank you.
1818620	1821620	The women urgently need to get their search for a camp under way
1821620	1824620	and find a permanent water source.
1824620	1827620	Their original supply of drinking water has run out.
1827620	1830620	All they have now is one muddy puddle.
1830620	1832620	We've gone that way.
1833620	1836620	The one direction we haven't gone is that way.
1836620	1838620	Yeah, that's where we are, thank you.
1838620	1841620	This time, 58-year-old Forrester's daughter Fee
1841620	1844620	will lead the expedition party's hunt for a beach.
1844620	1847620	I'm used to being in forests,
1847620	1849620	and I'm not going to be really happy
1849620	1851620	if people start telling me I'm going the wrong way.
1851620	1856620	The most important thing is that we go, and we go in a straight line.
1856620	1859620	Seven women volunteer to join Fee on the trek,
1859620	1861620	including furniture maker Kate.
1861620	1862620	She's got the sense of direction.
1862620	1864620	I'm following her.
1864620	1868620	Abi, Fran and three others stay behind in their temporary camp
1868620	1870620	to keep the vital fire alight.
1870620	1872620	We will come back with a beach.
1872620	1873620	Please do.
1875620	1877620	Go on, move on.
1877620	1881620	Fee's plan is to cut right through the dense jungle interior
1881620	1883620	to the opposite side of the island.
1883620	1885620	This is not a decent route.
1885620	1887620	It's full of veins and everything.
1887620	1888620	We're in a jungle.
1888620	1889620	I know.
1889620	1891620	Splitting up your group is a high risk.
1892620	1896620	But if you do decide to send out an advance party...
1896620	1899620	Preparation, preparation, preparation.
1899620	1903620	It really is fundamental to good survival.
1903620	1906620	..and you've got to prepare for any eventuality.
1906620	1910620	One small mistake can quickly spiral out of control.
1910620	1914620	I've got our group water where we can keep hydrated.
1914620	1916620	With rations restricted,
1916620	1920620	they've only brought two litres with them in improvised bamboo cups.
1920620	1921620	In this heat,
1921620	1924620	that's likely to last less than an hour.
1924620	1926620	I love it. I actually think that's really tasty.
1926620	1927620	It is nice, isn't it?
1927620	1928620	I think the bamboo flavours it.
1931620	1933620	In the last nine or ten years,
1933620	1936620	I've been made redundant four times.
1936620	1940620	I went from being this high-flying career woman to nothing.
1940620	1944620	I don't think the children have anything about me
1944620	1946620	that they would talk to their friends about.
1946620	1948620	You know, Daddy designs roads for a living.
1948620	1950620	I don't think there's anything...
1951620	1953620	..that makes me amazing to them.
1953620	1955620	I have to finish it and have to do it
1955620	1957620	and make my children proud of me.
1957620	1958620	Fee? What?
1958620	1960620	What about that way? That's downhill.
1960620	1962620	And there's lots of sunlight, which means...
1962620	1965620	No, we've had lots of matches with lots of sunlight.
1965620	1967620	What we need to do is get up here.
1967620	1968620	Fuck!
1968620	1970620	George, I'm just going to forge ahead.
1970620	1972620	She's going through anything.
1972620	1975620	Doesn't matter what it is, Fee's going to go through it.
1975620	1976620	She's on her mission.
1979620	1980620	George.
1980620	1983620	George, I have no idea if this is going to work.
1983620	1986620	Who gives a fuck? At least we're trying.
1986620	1990620	Fee's expedition party are now deep in the island's jungle interior.
1990620	1991620	What?
1991620	1994620	I've ripped my trousers even more.
1994620	1996620	I couldn't get any more ripped.
1996620	1998620	Fluids are running dangerously low
1998620	2000620	and they still have no idea how far they are
2000620	2002620	from a beach or a water source.
2002620	2005620	They're just losing so much water.
2005620	2008620	In unrelenting 34-degree heat,
2008620	2011620	the group are now sweating a litre of water an hour.
2012620	2015620	The more we're sweating, the more we're losing, aren't we?
2015620	2017620	Is that us running out of water now?
2017620	2018620	Yep. Yeah.
2018620	2019620	Oh, dear.
2019620	2023620	We've run out of water, which is pretty stupid, actually, I think.
2023620	2025620	God, this is nuts.
2029620	2031620	Lost and adrift in the jungle interior,
2031620	2033620	the women have no idea what they're doing.
2033620	2036620	The women have no idea when they'll find their next drink.
2036620	2038620	It's hard work. It's just draining.
2038620	2041620	Yeah. It's like being in a spider's web.
2041620	2045620	Is there any way to get fucking through?
2046620	2047620	This is looking better.
2047620	2049620	Wow. Look at that.
2049620	2050620	Sky!
2051620	2053620	I can smell the sea.
2053620	2054620	Fuck!
2055620	2058620	If we get there, can we have a celebratory swim?
2058620	2060620	I'm not wearing any pants.
2060620	2062620	Do I just have to go for the full-on mask?
2062620	2063620	Yeah.
2063620	2064620	I don't want to.
2064620	2065620	Whoa!
2065620	2066620	I can feel it.
2066620	2067620	Yeah, it's here.
2067620	2068620	Whoa!
2068620	2070620	I can see a fucking palm tree.
2070620	2071620	Whoo!
2071620	2074620	Unless I'm delusional, that is the decking sea woman.
2074620	2075620	This is for us.
2075620	2077620	Guys, we found it!
2077620	2078620	Is there a beach?
2078620	2079620	Yes!
2079620	2080620	Oh, God.
2080620	2082620	Whoo!
2082620	2083620	Look at this.
2083620	2084620	Oh, my God.
2084620	2085620	I feel like I'm going to cry.
2085620	2087620	Oh, my God, it's being sunk!
2087620	2088620	Yes!
2088620	2089620	Whoo!
2089620	2090620	God, God!
2090620	2091620	Amazing.
2091620	2092620	Yes!
2092620	2093620	Whoo!
2093620	2094620	Whoo!
2094620	2095620	Oh, my God!
2095620	2096620	It's like a mountain.
2096620	2097620	Whoo!
2097620	2098620	Although, really?
2098620	2099620	Did you ever think we would make it?
2099620	2100620	I honestly didn't.
2100620	2101620	We did it!
2101620	2102620	I know I'm going to cry.
2102620	2103620	Come on.
2103620	2104620	Oh!
2104620	2105620	This is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen.
2105620	2120620	And you know, if it was the most disgusting beach, this would still be the most beautiful
2120620	2121620	achievement, because that in there is horrific.
2121620	2122620	We're going swimming now.
2122620	2125620	in that cool Pacific water.
2125620	2127620	WHISTLE BLOWS
2151620	2153620	With the discovery of the beach
2153620	2155620	comes a lifeline for the women.
2156620	2159620	Honestly, I feel so dehydrated.
2159620	2162620	Basically, my mouth was feeling like Gandhi's flip-flop.
2162620	2164620	No energy.
2166620	2168620	We can clean our teeth...
2169620	2171620	..and we can comb our hair.
2171620	2173620	And I found some flip-flops.
2176620	2179620	The expedition party have discovered a beach,
2179620	2182620	but they're yet to find a permanent water source.
2182620	2184620	It looks like it might rain.
2184620	2185620	So, we're going to...
2185620	2188620	We might actually be showered all night tonight.
2189620	2190620	Shit.
2192620	2194620	Going down dark, we have no water.
2194620	2196620	We have no fire.
2196620	2198620	The sand flies everywhere.
2198620	2201620	So, you know, there is potential for it to be amazing,
2201620	2203620	but right now I'm just thinking,
2203620	2206620	oh, my God, how are we going to get through the night?
2208620	2212620	With night drawing in, the women have no choice but to sleep here
2212620	2214620	and return to collect the others in the morning.
2215620	2217620	I can actually smell myself.
2217620	2218620	Yeah.
2218620	2219620	I completely hum.
2219620	2220620	Yeah.
2220620	2221620	My armpits smell.
2221620	2222620	The worst thing is our feet.
2222620	2223620	Yeah.
2224620	2225620	With no shelter,
2225620	2228620	the group will have to take their chances with the elements.
2228620	2230620	And the frustrating thing for me is,
2230620	2232620	we all bloody knew to go be prepared.
2234620	2236620	Oh, my God.
2236620	2239620	3am and the heavens have opened.
2239620	2242620	Shivering, freezing cold.
2242620	2243620	I don't like this.
2243620	2244620	The women's expedition party
2244620	2246620	discovered a beach to base their camp,
2246620	2249620	but haven't yet found the key to their survival,
2249620	2251620	a sustainable water source.
2251620	2254620	We had a dunder about, well,
2254620	2256620	all the palm ponds that we found for our bed.
2256620	2260620	They're soaked through, stranded and dehydrated.
2260620	2263620	What the good thing is about getting this wet
2263620	2265620	is that we can wring out our shirts and suck them,
2265620	2267620	and I'm really not joking.
2268620	2271620	At the minute, we are barely coping with the situation
2271620	2272620	in which we find ourselves.
2272620	2273620	Barely.
2273620	2274620	Barely.
2274620	2278620	I mean, hardly, actually.
2278620	2279620	Barely.
2280620	2281620	Because we didn't prepare properly.
2281620	2282620	No.
2282620	2284620	That is the bottom line.
2284620	2286620	And now we're sitting in the fucking rain again.
2286620	2288620	Incredible.
2288620	2289620	In the height of storm season,
2289620	2290620	the weather can literally change
2290620	2291620	in the blink of an eye.
2291620	2294620	You know, one minute you're going to have scorching sunshine,
2294620	2296620	the next, thunder, lightning, torrential rain.
2296620	2298620	And in these sort of extreme conditions,
2298620	2300620	even the thickest jungle canopy
2300620	2302620	is going to give you precious little protection.
2303620	2311380	7am. It's day four on the island.
2311740	2314620	At their temporary camp, the night of torrential rain
2314620	2318680	has also had a disastrous consequence for the five women left behind.
2318680	2322940	The fire went out last night because of the weather.
2323660	2326780	All the kind of wood and everything we need was wet,
2327120	2331600	so when we put it on the fire, it just made the fire die.
2332220	2333340	It's just gone out.
2333340	2335120	The situation is critical.
2335780	2338440	Without fire, the group have lost their only means
2338440	2340600	of purifying the water from the muddy puddle.
2341300	2344720	They're now down to capturing rainwater in Beth's poncho.
2346440	2348340	This is what we're resorting to now.
2350600	2351540	Roof water.
2354640	2356420	On the other side of the island,
2356720	2359280	the expedition party is also having to rely
2359280	2361240	on an alternative source of hydration.
2361240	2368540	I think all of these coconuts are making my bowels move a little bit.
2370160	2375380	So I'm going to have to go and look for somewhere to try and do a poo.
2375740	2377160	I may as well just do this.
2377160	2378880	I'm going to have to put that on.
2381620	2384040	Because I've got no fucking place.
2387440	2391100	The women set off along the beach, scouring the area,
2391240	2393240	looking for a sustainable water source.
2393700	2395240	We saw all those riverbeds,
2395240	2397940	and I reckon this is where one of them obviously comes out,
2397940	2400080	because we've got this massive drainage point
2400080	2401340	of all this fresh water.
2402960	2403880	Hang on.
2403880	2406860	Are my eyes deceiving me, or is that a huge water source?
2410000	2412500	It's slightly muddy, but it's not salty.
2413200	2414420	Yay!
2414420	2415820	We found water!
2415820	2419740	We just need to find a container now to boil it in, and fire.
2419740	2424240	The discovery of the water source means the women can use this beach
2424240	2425740	as their permanent base.
2425740	2427240	All right, let's get going.
2427240	2430540	But before they make a camp, they face a daunting trek
2430540	2432740	through the jungle to collect the others.
2432740	2434240	Have we got any water again now?
2434240	2435240	No, we've got nothing.
2435240	2436240	Have we not got any water?
2436240	2437240	Nothing. We've got nothing.
2437240	2439740	So we're going on this trek knowing that we're going to get
2439740	2443240	absolutely fucked and dehydrated.
2443240	2445740	Now, honestly, I have no idea if this is right,
2445740	2448040	but we've made a plan, so we've got to stick to it.
2448040	2449240	Navigating under...
2449240	2452240	thick jungle canopy is always going to be difficult.
2452240	2455240	It's going to be unpredictable, you don't get reference points,
2455240	2457240	you haven't got the sun to guide you,
2457240	2460240	and embarking on a journey like that in 30-degree heat
2460240	2463240	with no water, really, you're on borrowed time.
2465740	2467240	You need to do it like you mean it.
2467240	2468240	Shall we show you?
2469240	2470240	Brilliant.
2471240	2473240	The women are marking their path
2473240	2476240	to help find their way back to the beach on their return.
2476740	2478240	Found a period tree.
2479240	2481240	It's on its monthly right now.
2481240	2484240	Let's go this way. It looks like there's a bit of a path.
2484240	2486240	I think we should be going more that way.
2486240	2487240	Which way? No way.
2487240	2488240	No!
2488240	2489240	That's going back on ourselves.
2489240	2493240	Exactly. We've just got to keep going this way, I'm afraid.
2493240	2495240	This is actually the opposite direction.
2495240	2497240	We're going back towards the beach.
2497240	2499240	What the fuck is this?
2500240	2503240	The expedition party are deep in the jungle interior
2503240	2506240	and have mistakenly headed north in the wrong direction
2506240	2508240	from their temporary camp,
2508240	2511240	now completely lost, they're doubling back on themselves.
2513240	2516240	You know, you have to ask yourself the reason they haven't come.
2516240	2518240	Do you think they're not coming?
2518240	2519240	Well...
2520240	2522240	They've got to come back.
2523240	2526240	Abi and the others have been unable to relight their fire
2526240	2528240	and have run out of drinking water.
2528240	2531240	They are now desperate for the other women to return.
2532240	2534240	I'm really fed up.
2534240	2538240	Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, four days, 100 metres from home,
2538240	2541240	100 metres from being dropped off. It's crazy.
2541240	2544240	Which way do you think our current base is?
2544240	2546240	Well, I think...
2547240	2548240	..it...
2548240	2550240	Oh, fuck.
2550240	2552240	I'm so confused, I don't know.
2553240	2558240	The expedition party remain lost and dangerously dehydrated.
2564240	2566240	What just happened there?
2566240	2569240	I was just calling so that hopefully the base camp
2569240	2572240	will be able to hear the hello and make a sound back.
2572240	2575240	Hello!
2576240	2577240	Listen.
2577240	2579240	Hang on. Shush! Shush!
2579240	2581240	Blow again. It was a one-whistle response.
2581240	2583240	Hello!
2584240	2585240	Yeah, that way.
2585240	2586240	They definitely whistled.
2586240	2589240	I wouldn't be surprised if they couldn't find the whistle at the other camp
2589240	2591240	and that's why they didn't reply.
2591240	2594240	Hello!
2597240	2598240	Fuck!
2598240	2600240	That's the first bird.
2600240	2601240	It's a minor bird.
2601240	2602240	So is this fucking birds?
2602240	2603240	I think it's birds, yeah.
2603240	2604240	Fucking birds!
2604240	2606240	We got a bit prematurely excited.
2606240	2608240	Right, where the fuck do we go now?
2609240	2612240	Moving through jungle, you get wall after wall of dense undergrowth
2612240	2614240	and what happens when everything looks the same,
2614240	2616240	it's so easy to lose your bearings
2616240	2619240	and then you get that rising sense of panic.
2619240	2624240	That big tree there, it's got all my slash marks in it from the way we came.
2626240	2629240	I think you're getting really confused with the directions
2629240	2633240	because if you go up that hill, that's where we just came from,
2633240	2635240	except we came up from a beach there.
2635240	2636240	We did not come from there, Fi,
2636240	2639240	because I've been marking trees all along that route there.
2639240	2642240	No, there's a much clearer way of saying it.
2642240	2643240	The ocean...
2643240	2645240	What I would say, Fi, at the moment, is that your way of saying it
2645240	2647240	is that I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
2647240	2649240	You're the one who's confident to say,
2649240	2650240	I've got a great sense of direction,
2650240	2653240	but you're not taking anything from anybody else.
2653240	2655240	There's another slash mark here.
2655240	2657240	Oh, no.
2659240	2661240	We have nothing to drink.
2661240	2663240	We don't know where we are.
2663240	2664240	Let's do my din.
2664240	2667240	I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.
2667240	2670240	How critical do you think our situation is now?
2670240	2672240	I'm absolutely crapping my pants now.
2672240	2674240	All I care about is water.
2674240	2677240	That is all I care about, water.
2677240	2680240	It's more than 24 hours since the expedition party
2680240	2682240	left their temporary camp
2682240	2684240	and are now further away than ever.
2685240	2689240	Back at base, the situation is critical, too.
2689240	2691240	Well, they're not coming for us today, are they?
2691240	2693240	Happy fucking Mondays.
2693240	2696240	The women left behind are struggling to find dry wood
2696240	2698240	to relight the fire, and without this,
2698240	2701240	they can't purify the remaining water in the puddle,
2701240	2703240	and they've barely eaten for four days.
2703240	2705240	Do you think we should start a fire?
2705240	2706240	Yes.
2706240	2709240	Do you want to start clearing all that shite off the fire, Gran?
2709240	2711240	I can't. My heart's beating like mad.
2711240	2713240	So is everybody's, Gran.
2713240	2714240	We're all in the same boat.
2714240	2715240	Fucking hell.
2715240	2716240	Let's not be bitchy, please.
2716240	2718240	People can manage and people can't,
2718240	2721240	and we'll have our ups and downs, but let's not bitch.
2721240	2722240	I'm sorry.
2722240	2724240	No, come and sit here. Deep breaths and don't talk.
2724240	2725240	Just come and sit here.
2725240	2727240	Come and sit on the comfy chair.
2727240	2728240	And sit there.
2734240	2736240	Don't let anyone fuck you off.
2736240	2738240	Breathe in slowly, please.
2738240	2740240	I've got a problem with her crying.
2740240	2742240	I've got a problem with her sitting on her arse
2742240	2744240	saying she doesn't feel well enough.
2744240	2745240	Stop doing anything.
2745240	2747240	All our hearts are beating fast.
2747240	2750240	Julie, you just order me about all the time.
2750240	2751240	I can't show you what I do.
2751240	2752240	Oh, my God.
2752240	2753240	No, that's not true.
2753240	2754240	That's absolutely not true.
2754240	2756240	Oh, my God, I was trapped the first day.
2756240	2758240	We're in day four now.
2758240	2760240	She needs a fucking rest.
2760240	2762240	And that is it.
2764240	2765240	Thank you.
2765240	2770240	Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?
2770240	2772240	And leave it there.
2772240	2774240	Tension in the camera really hurts.
2774240	2776240	OK.
2776240	2778240	Oh, my gosh.
2778240	2781240	It's just so hard.
2781240	2784240	And I'm not going to leave this, so I've got this bit.
2784240	2786240	I don't know how many days.
2789240	2790240	Next time on the island...
2790240	2792240	I think that was genuinely shitty,
2792240	2794240	walking away and letting the rest of us die in a big way.
2794240	2795240	We need to find food.
2795240	2797240	That's the big issue on the camp.
2797240	2798240	Whoo!
2798240	2799240	Yeah!
2799240	2801240	Get it, get it, get it, get it.
2801240	2802240	Fantastic.
2802240	2806240	This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in...
2806240	2807240	Argh!
2807240	2809240	We nearly got killed, actually.
2809240	2810240	..or eat you alive.
2810240	2813240	Everything around us is trying to kill us.
2813240	2814240	Argh!
2814240	2815240	Yeah, it's a scorpion.
2815240	2817240	I'm dropping like flies. We've not even started yet.
