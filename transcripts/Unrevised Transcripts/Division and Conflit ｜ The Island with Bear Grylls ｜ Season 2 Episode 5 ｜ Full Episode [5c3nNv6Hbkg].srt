1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:23,240
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,860
utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:40,940
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:51,740
strength the Windsor day it's too cute I can't who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,980
follow the men's island

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:05,300
it's a scorpion guys it'll be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height of the harsh

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,700
tropical storm season a bit like being in a disaster film they'll have to find their own water

9
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:21,380
and hunt for their own food watch him watch him go now go now that is amazing have these modern

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,940
day men got what it takes

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,240
to survive we're all sweating our bollocks off up there fella and it looks like yeah yeah looks

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,980
like you're doing call when it comes to wood

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:44,780
two weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island

14
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,460
that was the dumbest thing I ever did but now three of the men have quit now the dead weight's off let's get on with it

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,200
there and the island has taken its toll on the 11 that remain

16
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,460
I'm genuine I've never been so terrified in my life

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,260
having barely found anything substantial to eat they're now on the brink of starvation

18
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,580
we ain't conquered Jack nothing

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,240
and they say nothing

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,020
speaking of who you are

21
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,920
scriptwriting

22
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,340
it's a bit like being in a disaster film or you know or when um you hear on the

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,920
news that people have had a typhoon come through or a flood there's no water there's no electricity

24
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,600
you know stomachache

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
car is definitely needs some organます

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,820
could you get on with the show

27
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,840
like you've been hit by a major disaster.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,260
Oh, look, another day in paradise.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,040
It's been 15 days since the men arrived on the island.

30
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,600
And so far, they have survived on a meager diet

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,840
of a few hundred calories a day.

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,260
So thin now, like ribs, all sorts of bones

33
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,380
appearing that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.

34
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,760
Oh, hang on.

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, hang on.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,620
Lie down, mate, if you've.

37
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,220
Oh.

38
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,900
It's the nearest I've got to fainting,

39
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
or I assume it's fainting, having never

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
fainted before.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,140
But my vision just went, like, pulsating in and out,

42
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,420
in and out, in and out, in and out.

43
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,300
And then before I knew it, I was on my ass.

44
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,220
Sort of semi-collapsed.

45
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,820
We're surviving off limpets and, like, the odd one fish.

46
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,720
It's not going to sustain us for the next god-how-ever weeks.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,220
I think another week of this, we'll be struggling massively

48
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,080
just to even get up in the morning.

49
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
We need to find a way.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,740
We need to find a solid source of food or, you know,

51
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,000
we're going to be facing meltdown.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
We're out of food.

53
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,700
The bottom line is we don't have any food other than limpets.

54
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,780
We're getting weaker and weaker.

55
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,940
I certainly feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker.

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,480
So my priority is how I feel about, personally, is food.

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
I think the majority of our resources

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,940
should be to getting us good fish today.

59
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,240
Let's go.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,660
We are going to find lunch.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Come on, fishy, fishy, fishy.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
In a survival situation, you always face one huge dilemma.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,700
And that is, if you want to eat, you've got to hunt.

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,440
Hunting burns your energy.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,500
And there's no guarantee you're actually going to catch

66
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,360
anything at the end of it.

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,940
Any glimmers yet, Vic?

68
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,180
Oh, I can see fish.

69
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,920
Can you?

70
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Bastard, you.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every time you go looking for food, you're gambled.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're gambling.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're gambling with your energy reserves.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know what, Pidge?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You seem to be a bit lacking in enthusiasm.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, I'm so dead on my feet.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm actually dead on my feet.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I feel just completely gone.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You just keep nibbling it straight off the end.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The luck of the gods is not with us today.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Everyone's getting tired.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Everyone's hungry.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everyone's sick of bacon limpets.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We need some decent food.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We need it quick.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,500
If we don't get it soon, we're just going to start dropping like fires.

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Despite the group's desperation, one man refuses to be beaten.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's all push it to the edge.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I feel fine.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Another day at the office.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I feel really good, yeah.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Vic wants to change tactics and take the hunt to an unexplored part of the island.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
One kilometer from camp is a vast freshwater lagoon where he believes a much bigger prize

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
could be lurking.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One that could provide the group with the calories they so desperately need.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We are going hunting for fish.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We are going hunting for Mr. Cayman.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go lay some traps, fellas.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's go hunt some beast.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
As well as the search for food, the men's survival depends on them having a constant supply of drinking water.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They need at least 30 liters a day, which they must collect on a back-breaking two-kilometer round trip.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sam, when you go past Carl, can you ask him to come and help do the water run, please?

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's not shirking, is he?

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, I'm just saying the water run he's doing, and he's chewing his gums.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You do the maths.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
All right.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's go.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Grab Carl.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Kyle, are those crocs going to be okay for going across to get some water?

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Uh, there's nothing else knocking about to do water.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've done a lot of mileage the last few days.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think I'd rather do something a bit more camp-based today.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've done water two days in a row, mate.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So this is my third day, so, you know.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate it.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, we've got 11 people here.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But they're not here now, mate.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Uh, Carl, why don't we just sit here and tidy the camp, then?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll do it.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's no problem, mate.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cheers.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Cheers.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thanks, Piers.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Off we go.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I just sat in the office in front of the screens.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I know there's more to life than that.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So I just got to a stage where I wanted to break away from it, step away from the screens,

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and just do something different.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I like to think I can step up to most challenges.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I like to see myself as someone who will see things through to the end.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So if I was a person who was struggling in the group and was a useless one,

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that would be a big knock to my confidence.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Big knock.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was a little disappointed in Kyle.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It would have been nice if he just stepped up to the plate and said,

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you know what, I'll step in.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But he wasn't in the mood to do that today.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's not so much that I'm hungry.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The worst thing is just the energy.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I never for a second thought my energy would be as low as it has been.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Fuck.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't even lift up my legs.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now keep an eye out for Mr. Fucking Yurt.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
See a caiman, I'll scream.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How big did they say they get?

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Fuck, there's not many of these.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Six foot, the caiman, and six meters, the alligator.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, these are alligators?

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Fuck it.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know where Vic gets his energy, but I need half of that energy.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because Vic has got energy all the way through the day.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If I could take anything away from this island,

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I would like to be a little bit more like Vic Fellows.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
See, like that.

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That is actual shit.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What the fuck is this, Jurassic Park?

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's not shit.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's shit.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's not shit, fella.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is it?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's mud out of here.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you know what it is?

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sure there's a T-Rex here.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, fuck, that's great.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What do you do if you see something snapping at your feet?

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you going to do?

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you going to just machete it?

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Worst case scenario, we can't pin him or what have you.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm fighting for my life.

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's happening, isn't it?

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
As best as a facilities manager can do.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm 47.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This could be my last crazy hurrah.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And what better way to do it than the ultimate challenge

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
of surviving?

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, it's the ultimate challenge.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Can I provide for me?

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, I am very excited.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's Boy Scouts shit, isn't it?

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We're all over it.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We get knives and spears and stuff,

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
maybe even a bow and arrow to make.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean...

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How good does it get?

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Excited is an understatement.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, sometimes I have to keep...

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
..put a lid on it to not let it get like,

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
boom, shiz!

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That kind of excitement, yeah.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Just keep quiet, keep quiet, guy,

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
cos if there is a croc, we'll see it.

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Where do caimans live?

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I presume they lived in the water.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I thought they lived up trees.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do caimans live in holes?

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I reckon caimans live in holes.

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, dear.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, I'm making that up, but...

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It sounds good, though.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think I've got something in my bollocks

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
that's coming out.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Crocodiles are ambush predators.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They hunt their prey in shallow waters

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and are masters of the stealth attack.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We'll raise a sharp tee,

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and a bite that's three times more powerful than a lion.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Shhh.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sam, shhh.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That is a caiman.

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look, he's up, he's up.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Fuck, he's a biggie.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Now, there is our baby.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That is dinner, yeah.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That is our dinner.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We can get in there.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Would it be worth swimming in?

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Not for me.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not swimming in that.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Not a chance.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That is insanity, yeah.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Fucking bastard, him.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Look, look, look, he's moving.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He's moving.

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Got a bit of a ripple behind him.

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Look at that sign in that fucking head.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He's an inquisitive, he's a little boy, isn't he?

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come to daddy.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We now need to find where he comes in and goes out.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OK.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Wherever we are now is where they come out.

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Dead right.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That is where crocs come out of the water.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, that is perfect, isn't it?

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to make a snare there, right towards the water.

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Have you ever caught anything that snared before?

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Have I ever made a snare before?

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, he's there, he's about.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's back, he's back.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where, where, where?

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Straight through here.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Straight through here.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
See him?

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He fucking has got closer as well, hasn't he?

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That shifty little bastard has got closer, hasn't he?

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He's not scared of us.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He'll have to keep an eye on him.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, I'm setting the trap.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's why I keep looking past you.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He keeps dropping and dunnies that bugger him.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The men have had just two days' survival training

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
where they learnt how to set basic traps.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But the reality of catching a crocodile

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that can measure up to 13 feet is a different matter entirely.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is proper Boy Scout shit, this, isn't it?

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's going to test it.

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll test it.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah?

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh!

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Dinner is served.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh!

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Eh?

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's not bad, is it?

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's all right, fellas.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh!

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's the one.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's bust a move.

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Back to base, yeah?

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Back to base.

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Late afternoon.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
58-year-old Phil is returning from the water run

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
with the help from Dr Pearce.

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Watch your step.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's a good thing we didn't carry over the jerry can

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
up and down these rocks.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Whoo!

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And home.

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
While Kyle continues to rest on the beach.

288
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's a feeling amongst Camden

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
he's not contributing as much as he should be.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's just I feel like I've just been trying to deal with the fire

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and do the water,

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and Kyle's been kind of doing the feet manicuring bit.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a little bit like anything in life, you know.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can have a rest, but do the work first.

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's been almost two weeks since Kyle ensured the group's survival

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
by starting a fire with his guys.

297
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And now he's got his glasses.

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Now, when Kyle first got in here, he cracked the fire.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was absolutely brilliant.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Since then, man's not got a day's graft in him.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Not a freaking day's graft in him.

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I get the distinct impression, Vic, that you're getting a bit miffed.

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm just getting miffed by anybody that springs into my mind

304
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that's not sweating as hard as me.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Pull your thumb out of your arse, you lazy bastard.

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Todd?

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah?

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I feel like I'm kind of nearing my physical limit,

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and I think it's quite a common event I'll come down

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and you're doing your feet or you're sitting by the fire.

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I feel that perhaps you haven't been pulling your weight

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in the last week or so, OK?

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Today, for me, has been a bit of a challenging one, actually.

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Can't lie.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I haven't been able to do as much as I thought I would be able to,

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and, like, when you're in this situation,

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
if you can't contribute,

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you feel like you're really letting the team down.

320
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Despite the men's best efforts,

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
it's yet another day with empty stomachs.

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Bloody hell.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Boys, there's no meat on you.

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You need a bit of cake.

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey, look, you can see Piers' heart beating through his rib, look.

326
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Fucking hell.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Being hungry...

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
..really...

329
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
..does affect your mental and your physical state.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Every step is hard when you're hungry.

331
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There would be a stage where, soon,

332
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
our bodies give up on us.

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And we're not far from that.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How are you feeling now?

335
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Exhausted.

336
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
After over two weeks of near starvation,

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the men's situation is becoming critical.

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Desperate to catch a high-calorie prize,

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Vic and Dan have decided to go on a diet.

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's been a long, long journey.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Vic and Dan have set multiple crocodile traps

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
around the island's freshwater lagoon.

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Bingo.

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But so far, they haven't caught a thing.

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
By the look of it, it's done sod all.

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Fuck.

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Shit.

348
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Nothing, I'm afraid.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
On such an extreme low-calorie diet,

350
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
you're susceptible to infection

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and your mental capacity is low.

352
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And if nothing changes,

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
really, you're on borrowed time.

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Over two weeks with barely any food going in,

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the men's morning routines are anything but regular.

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I feel like it's got to that moment where

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm probably going to need to go for a shit-sink.

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
When it comes to options,

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
if they've got land or sea,

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think I'm going to opt for the sea.

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Where are you going to go?

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction?

363
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know.

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction or...?

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He's going for it.

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Carl's taking a dump in the sea.

367
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Good man.

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, the most beautiful spot in the world to take a dump in.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Have you joined the poo crew?

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So, I'm one for, back at home,

371
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
maybe a four to five shit a day, man.

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A day? A day?

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm pretty good, I'm very regular.

374
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I haven't shat until half six this morning

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and now I feel enlightened.

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm now part of the poo crew.

377
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But 28-year-old Piers, the group's doctor,

378
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
isn't having as much success.

379
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
How's your, um...

380
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How are the bowels? Bowels?

381
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Any movement yet?

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Being stubborn.

383
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wow. No poo for 15 days.

384
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It'll come.

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Are you ready? One, two, three.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
With no food to eat,

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the men still have to expend their energy on vital tasks,

388
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
like keeping their fire going

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to boil and purify the water that they collect.

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hello, hello.

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you want to get a nice picture of Carl grooming himself,

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you're quite welcome to do that while we're all getting wood.

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Where's that? Just round the corner, doing his toes after.

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He's just had a swim.

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Today, we were supposed to all contribute getting wood

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and then do individual tasks,

397
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and he has done nothing.

398
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think my tolerance has kind of reached a bit of a limit.

399
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know, if you do let it boil inside,

400
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
it does become a bit of a problem when it comes to a head,

401
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
like it is now.

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I can't hold something. I can't.

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But, listen, when everybody...

404
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And it ain't just me.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When lots of people bitch and chaff

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and nobody seems to want us to confront it,

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think, come on, boys, we're team-mates.

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Fuck it.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Where is he?

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Up there, sound his arse.

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's taking piss. Come on, man, fucking hell.

412
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Kyle!

413
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Kyle.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How you doing?

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm busting my knackers, fella, doing wood,

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and you're doing your feet.

417
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not doing my feet. I've come out of the water.

418
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Whatever.

419
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah.

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not just me.

421
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It just seems that I'm the only one with balls

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
to come up and speak to you.

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, that's fine.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Every fucker's bitching and moaning

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
that you're never doing wood with us.

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and it looks like...

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

429
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Looks like you're doing fuck all when it comes to wood.

430
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Admittedly, I'm not getting wood now,

431
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
cos I've just come out of the water,

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
cos I went through shit.

433
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're fucking pulling tree upon tree upon tree,

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and it does look like you're always doing your feet.

435
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I won't lie to you, it does.

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's go.

437
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It was almost like a bit of a cheap shot from Vic.

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He's clearly got stuff which has been bubbling under the surface.

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I felt like...

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
..I haven't fitted in with the group,

441
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and, you know, I've done stuff to try and change that.

442
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But sometimes it's just the group dynamics

443
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
that's on for everyone.

444
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
People are starting to fray around the edges.

445
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Some of them are fraying,

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
some of them are coming away at the seams.

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We seriously, seriously need to find

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
a sustainable source of food.

449
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
As the men continue to physically decline,

450
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the group is becoming fractured,

451
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and if members of the group are perceived

452
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
not to be pulling their weight,

453
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
they can easily become alienated.

454
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then if those rifts aren't healed,

455
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it becomes a downward spiral of conflict

456
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that ultimately could destroy the men's community.

457
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hello.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There's a net here. A net?

459
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah.

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, yeah.

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Mate, this could be big.

462
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This could make a big difference to us.

463
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Game-changer.

464
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Game-changer.

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Could be.

466
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Fellas!

467
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Look what I found!

468
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We've got ourselves a gill net!

469
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Whoo-hoo!

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Fucking brilliant.

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's pretty fucking big!

472
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah!

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Get in there, baby!

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What a whale!

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Nice one, Will!

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Sting of the dog!

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yes!

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Roar, roar!

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Brilliant.

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's get ourselves some tea.

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If we get this net in the water,

482
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
then we have our best hope yet of catching fish.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
For thousands of years,

484
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
fishermen have been perfecting the art

485
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
of setting their fishing nets.

486
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If you get it right, you unlock the ocean's larder.

487
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If you get it wrong,

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
then all they'll be doing is wasting their precious time

489
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and precious energy,

490
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
two resources that they can't afford to waste.

491
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Net's out. Exciting times.

492
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What are we looking at?

493
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

494
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Feel quite positive.

495
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think it will catch fish.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I think it might even catch fish for us tonight.

497
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Exhausted after a morning's hard work,

499
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
the men allow themselves some downtime.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So, boys, here's one.

501
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You can request Bear to bring you one item

502
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
for the journey back.

503
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thermos full of English breakfast tea.

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I am going to get a bottle of octomar whisky.

505
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
A whole bottle of whisky?

506
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
A whole bottle of octomar whisky for my journey back.

507
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Bam!

508
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If I could...

509
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
..chicken pie my wife makes,

510
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and she always puts your name in it as well.

511
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Nice.

512
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
All the big love art and all that sort of thing.

513
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Pock pastry lid?

514
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes, dead right.

515
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's quite easy.

516
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You see if it doesn't work out with you and your missus,

517
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
can you give her our number?

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I honestly think there's something wrong with her upstairs

519
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because she really is a nice woman.

520
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
How did you find such a nice woman?

521
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I have no idea.

522
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What have you done?

523
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You must have a size of a dick and a donkey.

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Not a clue.

525
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Not a clue, but God bless her.

526
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
How did you meet your wife, if you don't mind me asking?

527
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I went round and knocked on her door.

528
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Did you?

529
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I fucking did, yeah.

530
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Dead right I did, yeah.

531
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What did you say?

532
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Hello, I saw you at work today.

533
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You turned up to meet your mate.

534
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, yeah, I did, yeah.

535
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I wondered if I could take you out.

536
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Er, let me think about it.

537
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I thought, oh, damn it, she went.

538
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, OK, then.

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That was it.

540
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's such a romantic that you live on the set of Billy Elliot

541
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
meets Postman Pat.

542
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Absolutely brilliant, it was.

543
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So, yeah, well done, mate.

544
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well done, you, man.

545
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Glad you.

546
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Sport with peers.

547
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Trotting along the beach, looking vaguely happy with himself.

548
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So I think Piers might be off to try and have poo number one.

549
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
How many days has he been without poo?

550
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He's 17.

551
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Dr Piers is now the only member of the group

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
who has not yet joined the poo crew.

553
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Any luck, mate?

554
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No luck today, mate.

555
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Here we come.

556
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Here he comes.

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't do it.

558
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Dr Piers.

559
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Dr Piers?

560
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Have we succeeded?

561
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Is it?

562
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Is it?

563
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
No.

564
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, no.

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No!

566
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Mission failure.

567
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, no.

568
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
NASA, we have a problem.

569
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Close.

570
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Be patient, lads.

571
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Be patient.

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Go in your medical kit, get a rubber glove, because I'm going in.

573
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Have fun, boys.

574
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Cheers, mate.

575
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We'll do our best.

576
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Mid-afternoon.

577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
After a couple of hours' rest,

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the men get back to work.

579
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Come on, my son.

580
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Bite.

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Two weeks ago, they were dropped on the island

582
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
with eight fishing hooks,

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but now they're down to just two.

584
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Shit.

585
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Could you unsnag my line?

586
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I've caught it on the rock.

587
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Shit.

588
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, we've lost another rod there, guys.

589
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Shit.

590
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We've lost a hook.

591
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Further down the beach,

592
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
oil engineer Dan and Dr Piers swim out to check the net.

593
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What do we think we've done?

594
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Nothing.

595
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What do we think, William?

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Do you think there's going to be anything on there?

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're saying it.

598
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There's lots of rocks.

599
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Anything, Barney?

600
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No, sadly not.

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We're hoping for the nets.

602
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So I've got to see this moment.

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Doesn't look like a trawl.

604
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, I guess far as it says, it looks like the square root of Eiffel.

605
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
What's wrong?

606
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It looks like we'll be going hungry for dinner.

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Huh?

608
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It looks like we'll be eating ass.

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The nets are empty.

610
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Is that right?

611
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Shit.

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What's happening, fella?

613
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
This is what we've caught.

614
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Caught a load of coral.

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Fuck.

616
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The razor sharp coral has taken over the water.

617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's gone.

618
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's gone.

619
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's gone.

620
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's gone.

621
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's gone.

622
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's gone.

623
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's gone.

624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's gone.

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's gone.

626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's gone.

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's gone.

628
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's gone.

629
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The razor sharp coral has destroyed the men's net.

630
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
No fish at all.

631
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh.

632
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Shit.

633
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We really are up Chips Creek, aren't we?

634
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
With no net, one fishing hook.

635
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Situation just went from bad to much, much worse.

636
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What do you think, Phil?

637
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Well, that's disastrous.

638
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's no food for anyone, and no means to get food.

639
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Shit.

640
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We've got one hook in the net.

641
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Done.

642
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Done.

643
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Done.

644
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Done.

645
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Done.

646
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Done.

647
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Done.

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Done.

649
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Done.

650
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Done.

651
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Done.

652
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Done.

653
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Done.

654
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Done.

655
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Done.

656
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Done.

657
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,200
Shit, we've got one hook left. We're fucked.

658
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,800
So, we've got one hook to fish for a month.

659
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
It's pretty depressing, yeah? More than one.

660
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,000
No joy with nets.

661
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,160
Fuck, are we going to be depleted, or what?

662
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
Disaster.

663
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,880
We're down to our last fishing hook.

664
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,840
So...

665
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,240
the onset of starvation looks upon us.

666
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
With morale at rock bottom, Barney, Phil and Sam Farmer

667
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,160
head out to the lagoon for the daily check of Vic's crocodile traps.

668
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,200
Chances of catching a caiman, 4%.

669
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
The caiman's definitely been here.

670
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,920
How do you know that? Because the trap is destroyed.

671
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,000
Gosh, look at that.

672
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,040
It's almost certain that it's been here for a long time.

673
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
It's been here for a long time.

674
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,960
It's certainly been triggered by a caiman.

675
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,960
The bait's gone, the trigger's occurred,

676
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,640
and it looks like there's been a bit of a struggle,

677
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,920
and the rope is firmly in the water.

678
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,320
Well, that is incredibly encouraging in one sense.

679
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,560
Very.

680
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,360
Is there any chance that the caiman could still be on the end?

681
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,360
There is a chance.

682
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,200
OK.

683
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,280
Fuck, he is.

684
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
Is he? Shit.

685
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
I think he's under here, isn't he?

686
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,040
Is that his back? No way.

687
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,840
Is this his back here?

688
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Come here.

689
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
We need to be a bit careful about this.

690
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,000
I can see scales on the back of that rope.

691
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,080
I can see there are crocodile or caiman-like scales

692
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,400
just underneath the water.

693
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm convinced... Go and have a look.

694
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm convinced he's there.

695
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,840
Just be careful. Be very careful.

696
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
He's there.

697
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
He's there.

698
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,400
Just be careful. Be very careful.

699
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,960
There's no doubt about it, the caiman's there.

700
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

701
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,520
There is a caiman in the water right next to us now.

702
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,120
We need to be careful, cos as soon as we drag him out there,

703
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,040
he's going to be angry.

704
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,720
I can't quite... I cannot quite believe it.

705
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,560
No, I can't either.

706
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,840
I cannot believe it.

707
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,880
My heart... Mine too.

708
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,600
Is your heart beating? Mine too, cos he's obviously alive, right?

709
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Yeah.

710
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,920
So, the crocodile is the largest, it's the meatiest animal

711
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
they're going to find on the island.

712
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,160
But when they're cornered or they're scared,

713
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
that's when they're most likely to attack.

714
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,400
And if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,

715
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,800
you're in trouble.

716
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,960
The minute we disturb this, all hell will break loose.

717
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,720
The three of us could take him on.

718
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,720
I think it's sensible to go and get many more hands.

719
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,080
I want you two to stay here. I'll run back to camp.

720
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
Yeah. Deliver the news. Yeah.

721
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,560
And we're going to pull him out of that trap.

722
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,680
He's going to fight like buggery. Absolutely.

723
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,840
Go on, Barney. Excellent. Yes!

724
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,920
Crocodiles can remain submerged for hours before surfacing.

725
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,920
And as a lagoon is their ideal habitat,

726
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,400
it's certain to be populated by more than just one.

727
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,400
There's definitely an alligator moving this way.

728
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,520
It's a little bit weird looking at one that could get you right here.

729
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,000
And another one that's heading towards you.

730
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,600
It's almost like, where the bait?

731
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
Barney's looking excited. What's up, Barney?

732
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,720
OK, come in, come in. Gather in, gather in.

733
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,520
OK, so we're...

734
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,200
He's ready. I'd say we're 95% sure

735
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,160
we've got a caiman in our second trap.

736
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Fuck off. Let's rock and roll, boys.

737
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,440
Let's rock and roll.

738
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,760
Let's rock and roll.

739
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,120
I think we nailed it.

740
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,880
Let's go. Let's go.

741
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,200
Oh, this is exciting. This is exciting.

742
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Bingo, big fella.

743
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,400
It's either that or a scaly log.

744
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,400
A scaly log we will eat.

745
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,240
Despite being too exhausted to help with the group's daily tasks,

746
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,440
the prospect of a crocodile feast has inspired Kyle to join the hunting pack.

747
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Let's do it, lads.

748
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,200
I feel like Gandalf with my giant...

749
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I feel like Gandalf with my giant shaft.

750
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
How are you feeling, Barney?

751
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,760
It's very difficult because I'm so excited and this is all what we want,

752
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,760
but when it comes to actually pulling the animal out and having to kill it,

753
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,760
I don't know how I feel at all.

754
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,760
For the moment, absolutely buzzing.

755
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,120
Yeah, definitely feel like a tribe on a hunt.

756
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

757
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,480
Everyone's come out prepared.

758
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, this is the most excitement I've felt since I've bloody been here.

759
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,160
How are you feeling, Vic?

760
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,080
I'm feeling excited.

761
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
But we've got a job to do, we dispatch it in a humane manner as we can.

762
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,640
But, woohoo, that's how I'm feeling.

763
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,600
When you're hunting crocs, you've got to make sure that you don't become the prey

764
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,280
because these prehistoric beasts are fast.

765
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,880
Once they get a hold of you, grab you, drag you into the water,

766
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,320
then they strike, bam, lightning speed and incredible power.

767
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,960
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

768
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,920
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

769
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,760
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

770
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,200
This thing is going to go absolutely mental.

771
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,640
Absolutely mental when it comes out.

772
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,800
Such a blessing. It's a dangerous animal, but we need the food.

773
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
We need the food.

774
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,800
This way, guys. Barney.

775
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,560
I've got the cavalry.

776
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,840
Putting on the cavalry.

777
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,040
Where is it?

778
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,920
It literally is just where you can see that blue rope by the log.

779
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,080
The blue rope is wrapped around the caiman.

780
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,560
Oh!

781
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,120
He's big, boys, he's big.

782
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,120
OK, he's moving.

783
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,400
We need to get a loop over that mouth.

784
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
I think one of these branches has him pinned.

785
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,600
He's making bubbles, I think he's going to do something.

786
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,800
Here we go, there we go.

787
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,400
Look at that beauty.

788
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,400
He needs to breathe, doesn't he?

789
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,320
He's hissing at us.

790
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,280
OK, he's trying to go back.

791
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Here we go, boys.

792
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,240
Right, where's that rope with the hook?

793
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,760
Here, look, look.

794
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,320
OK, boys, we need two people on that rope.

795
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,000
We need to pull him ashore.

796
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,240
Is his mouth open?

797
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,920
His mouth is slightly open.

798
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,200
OK, big.

799
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,400
Nice and calmly, boys.

800
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
Come on, big.

801
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,440
Whoa, come on, baby.

802
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,440
Come on, big.

803
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Right, nobody moves, his mouth's open.

804
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,440
Yeah, you get him, you get him.

805
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,960
You fucking get him.

806
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,040
Round his neck, round his neck.

807
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,040
That's it, we got you, little sod.

808
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,040
Come on, big boy.

809
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Come on, boys, come on.

810
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,040
Right, I'll distract him.

811
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,040
Hey, Mr Croc.

812
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Hey.

813
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,640
Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me.

814
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

815
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,200
OK, OK, Vic, go now, go now.

816
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,760
He's probably going to roll soon.

817
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Over the teeth, over the teeth.

818
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh, branch, one more, one more.

819
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,160
Mate, mate, mate, you've almost got it.

820
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,880
Watch him, watch him, go now, go now.

821
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,320
You're in, you're in, you're in, you're in, you're in.

822
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,520
Here we go, puppy dog.

823
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,600
Yes, yes.

824
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,600
Ah, you little fucker.

825
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,920
Watch him, watch him.

826
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,240
Right, Sam, I'm very conscious of you stood in the water, mate.

827
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,200
There is another one in that lake.

828
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,440
Yeah, get out of there.

829
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,640
Yeah, get on the bank, Sam.

830
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,520
Sam, Sam.

831
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,040
Sam, watch his tail.

832
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,280
Sam, get out of the water, mate.

833
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,640
Mate, mate, I think we're good.

834
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
No, see, there is another one in this lake.

835
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,840
If he came along and nipped your heel...

836
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,040
Let's just fucking get this guy.

837
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,880
Have we got enough people tugging on that rope?

838
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
Yeah, yeah, Charles has got it.

839
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,480
There we go.

840
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,760
Right, we now have two.

841
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,360
That's it.

842
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,840
He can still snap, can't he?

843
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,680
Watch his tail on your legs.

844
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
I am on it, I'm on it, don't worry.

845
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,040
All right.

846
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,480
And again, Barney, and again, Barney.

847
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
No, no, no, look what it's snagged on now.

848
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
Right, it's snagged on this one.

849
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,000
Take your time, fellas.

850
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,600
Right, don't cut the rope.

851
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,480
Oh, shit, he's growling.

852
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
This fucker is fucking powerful.

853
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,120
Give him a minute.

854
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,960
I think he speaks English.

855
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,960
Where's the knife?

856
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,800
I've got a knife with me.

857
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,120
Get the knife out ready.

858
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,000
And then, Kyle, what are you doing?

859
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,680
You're going to drive the knife, take him out.

860
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,320
Right, where are you going to put it?

861
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,480
Just behind his eyes, let's go.

862
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,080
Heads on, guys, heads on, heads on.

863
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,320
We go on go.

864
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
One, two, three, we all go on go.

865
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
One.

866
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,400
Two, three, go.

867
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,280
Come on, boys, get in there, get in there.

868
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,000
Drive it out, drive it out.

869
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,800
Go on, lads, push it in.

870
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,720
Push it, lads, that's the one, boys.

871
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
That's it, that's it.

872
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,120
Yes, mate, yes.

873
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,640
That's it.

874
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,360
Gentlemen, we have handbags.

875
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,320
Come on.

876
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,000
Nice teamwork.

877
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Look them down, boys.

878
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,920
Come on.

879
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Come on, boys.

880
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,520
Back it up.

881
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
Come on, boys.

882
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,600
Oh, he's twitching, he's twitching, he's moving.

883
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,800
Kyle, fucking killer blow, mate.

884
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,000
That was awesome.

885
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,560
Get in there, boys.

886
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,840
Woo!

887
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
Actually wrapping up a dinosaur.

888
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,520
We just caught a prehistoric animal.

889
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,760
Damn it.

890
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,520
Amazing.

891
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,400
It feels so caveman.

892
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,080
Doesn't it?

893
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,280
Doesn't it feel so caveman?

894
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,080
Yes.

895
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,080
If Fierce doesn't shit after eating a load of this,

896
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,320
he's got a serious problem.

897
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
I know, just.

898
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,160
How many people in the world can say,

899
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
wrestle the crocodile that killed him?

900
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,360
We are in an elite group of blokes.

901
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,880
After 17 days without anything substantial to eat,

902
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,520
the men have finally hit the jackpot

903
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,520
and dispatched one of nature's most fearsome predators.

904
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,120
Seeing this, it does make you have respect for crocodiles.

905
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
This is a big one, really big one.

906
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
So I just wanted to get it done in a clean way

907
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,720
without making a mess of it.

908
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,400
To pull it off and grab a croc like this is amazing.

909
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,600
Should we rock and roll then, boys?

910
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,400
Yeah.

911
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,560
One, two, three, up.

912
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,160
Kyle.

913
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,840
Yeah.

914
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,240
What would you be doing in your normal life right now?

915
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,200
Back home, it'd be a bit more mundane than this.

916
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,320
I definitely wouldn't have a croc on my shoulders.

917
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Seriously, look how much meat there is on that bad boy.

918
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,480
Fucking awesome.

919
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
Not only have the men proved

920
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,960
that they're top of the island's food chain,

921
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,320
but after surviving on roughly 400 or 500 calories a day,

922
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,000
suddenly they've landed themselves a feast of just epic proportions.

923
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,120
Just think of that fucking delicious dinner we're going to have later, boys.

924
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,840
News of the big catch soon spreads around the island.

925
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,080
Come on, fellas.

926
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,840
Oh, my God.

927
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,920
Holy shit.

928
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, my God.

929
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,240
No fucking way.

930
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,440
You are absolutely shitting me.

931
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,760
That is absolutely enormous.

932
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,640
That's amazing, isn't it?

933
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,800
That is amazing.

934
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Woo-hoo!

935
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
Keep going, lads.

936
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,720
Fucking hell.

937
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,080
And roll, roll.

938
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
Get in there, boys.

939
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,240
Yeah!

940
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Woo!

941
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,280
Yeah!

942
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
Yeah!

943
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,240
Yeah!

944
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Woo-hoo!

945
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,440
Come on, lads!

946
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Come on, lads!

947
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,840
A crock of this size could provide the men

948
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,960
with tens of thousands of calories.

949
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,640
What do you think of that, big boy?

950
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,760
That's beautiful.

951
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
Give some respect to him.

952
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,560
Out of the water, trapped, dispatched, we in 15, 20 minutes.

953
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,560
Yeah.

954
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,560
That's brilliant.

955
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
I'm pleased about that.

956
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
We were very respectful of her.

957
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh, my God.

958
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,040
I think I can see a plate of meat coming along.

959
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,360
Oh, hello.

960
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,680
Look at this, boys.

961
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,680
As if you didn't need any more motivation.

962
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,000
Today, I managed to catch a bloody crocodile.

963
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,080
And my God, was it something.

964
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,600
I'm normally at a desk or on a phone talking to clients.

965
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,440
I don't kill crocodiles.

966
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,840
Carl, look at that.

967
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,840
Oh, mate.

968
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Get in.

969
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,440
Unbelievable.

970
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,360
Wow.

971
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,880
Look at that.

972
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,960
Let the feast begin, boys.

973
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,960
Yes.

974
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Boys get stuck in, it's like chicken.

975
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
That is wonderful.

976
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,560
Just had my first taste of crocodile.

977
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,080
To me, it just tasted absolutely divine.

978
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,920
It's nice to have a mouthful of meat, isn't it?

979
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
Not just a nibble.

980
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,560
We all get more than we can possibly eat.

981
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,240
Here's the heart.

982
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,160
This is Kyle's, the killer.

983
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,640
Kyle, salute you, sir.

984
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,120
Based on the fact that I killed the croc,

985
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,400
I was given the privilege of eating his heart.

986
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,400
It felt like a good feeling.

987
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,600
Almost like a prize for doing a good job.

988
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,600
Go on, Kyle.

989
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,040
I feel like you're inheriting its strength.

990
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,040
Like a boss.

991
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,600
Yeah.

992
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,360
Oh, f**k, that was nice.

993
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,520
God, that was nice.

994
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,880
Oh, that second piece I took was beautiful.

995
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,640
Oh, God, I feel like it's after Sunday dinner at home.

996
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,920
Absolutely lovely.

997
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,120
What a lovely, lovely feeling that is.

998
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
I feel sorry for Piers,

999
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
because he needs to open his bowels,

1000
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
otherwise it's going to be painful.

1001
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,040
Oh, he's going to open them after this.

1002
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,400
So I was absolutely dead on my feet.

1003
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,320
I was completely and utterly gone.

1004
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,880
And suddenly, the morale boost the team needed,

1005
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,320
needed that so badly, to kick the spirits up.

1006
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,320
I think this counts as just for today,

1007
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,320
if nothing else, more than surviving.

1008
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,680
6am.

1009
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,520
MUSIC PLAYS

1010
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,200
Dr Piers is feeling the benefit of last night's feast.

1011
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,880
Here, you've got some big news for me.

1012
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,440
Yeah, I am the last member of the poo club.

1013
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,160
Well done, Piers.

1014
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,320
Do you want to give Piers a round of applause?

1015
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,400
Yes!

1016
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Yes, Piers.

1017
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,440
Brilliant.

1018
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,920
Yes, Piers.

1019
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,880
How did it feel?

1020
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,560
It felt great, actually.

1021
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,520
Really good.

1022
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,600
I thought it was going to be really hard.

1023
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,480
I thought it was going to be like rabbit droppings.

1024
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
It's stuck together.

1025
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,720
Oh, what was it like?

1026
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,160
Like a wet sausage.

1027
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,160
A wet sausage?

1028
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,160
Yeah.

1029
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,160
Dreamy.

1030
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Absolutely dreamy.

1031
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,400
Yeah.

1032
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
It's that crock pushed it all down.

1033
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,520
Lads, crock's ready.

1034
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,840
With plenty of crocodile meat still left over,

1035
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,920
cameraman Ross serves up breakfast.

1036
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Char-grilled to smoky perfection.

1037
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,600
Oh, that's good, isn't it?

1038
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,840
I think it's better.

1039
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,720
I think it's better than yesterday.

1040
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,600
With their bellies full, the men set about their daily chores.

1041
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Look at that.

1042
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,400
We have done wood in the same time it took Kyle to get dressed.

1043
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,200
Tell me that ain't the greatest thing.

1044
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,560
Right, right.

1045
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,920
Team effort, boys.

1046
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,080
I feel like I can just lie on this beach right now

1047
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,080
and think about nothing and do nothing

1048
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,080
and not feel guilty for the first time pretty much since we got here.

1049
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,080
Does this feel personal collection, though?

1050
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,080
This is only for me.

1051
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,080
I thought so, mate.

1052
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,080
A bit slower.

1053
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,080
I thought that.

1054
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,080
A bit slower.

1055
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,080
That's it.

1056
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,080
That's it.

1057
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,080
It's working.

1058
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,080
Oh, what?

1059
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,080
That's it.

1060
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,080
That's it.

1061
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,080
That's it.

1062
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
That's it.

1063
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
That's it.

1064
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
That's it.

1065
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
That's it.

1066
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
That's it.

1067
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
That's it.

1068
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,440
That's it.

1069
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
That's it.

1070
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Lovely.

1071
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,640
Enjoy the idyllic tropical sunshine.

1072
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,640
I think life isn't too bad after all.

1073
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,880
For the second night in a row,

1074
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,480
the men anticipate a hearty feast of crocodile meat.

1075
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,760
Does everyone fancy the last of the crock?

1076
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,920
I would love a bit.

1077
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,320
As well as giving the group vital calories,

1078
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,280
the sudden intake of rich food

1079
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,040
appears to have solved another of the men's problems.

1080
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,360
Dan, how were your ablutions this afternoon?

1081
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,080
Danny had a trump and a fall of food, didn't he?

1082
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,800
He shit himself this afternoon while he was making his bed.

1083
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,800
It's dribbling down my legs.

1084
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,800
Just a little bit.

1085
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,440
A little bit of boo came out.

1086
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,720
I had to squeeze my socks out.

1087
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,720
Who's that by the way?

1088
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,720
Oh, God.

1089
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,360
Well, you fucking arsed, didn't you?

1090
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,400
Crocodile broth this evening.

1091
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,280
It's going to be superb.

1092
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,320
Come on, boys, dig in, please.

1093
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Pass it round.

1094
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
How is it, Vic?

1095
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Oh, it's strong.

1096
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,040
I think strong is a good word.

1097
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,280
There is some distinct smell of poo about this.

1098
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,840
It smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it?

1099
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,600
It does smell a bit suspicious, doesn't it?

1100
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,600
Yeah.

1101
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,600
Shit.

1102
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,920
Oh, crikey.

1103
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,440
Phil, what's the verdict?

1104
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,360
I've had two mouthfuls and that's two mouthfuls too many.

1105
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,840
I can feel the squirts coming on.

1106
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,200
The 30-degree tropical heat

1107
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,160
is making the food smell.

1108
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,320
The meat has spoiled the remains of the crocodile,

1109
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,320
leaving the men, once again, with nothing to eat.

1110
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,680
The final meal of my croc, it was basically rotten meat.

1111
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,120
It was pretty...

1112
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Like it?

1113
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,960
I don't want to think about it too much.

1114
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,400
It was pretty much the worst thing I've ever had in my life.

1115
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,080
Oh. Oh, dear.

1116
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,520
Oh!

1117
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,840
Mind your shoulder, Piers.

1118
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,760
Yeah?

1119
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Well, tonight marked the end of our crocodile feast.

1120
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,600
From now on, we've got no more meat to eat.

1121
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,800
Now that crocodile has dried up,

1122
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,200
we need another source of food in Highland.

1123
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,440
Oh, my God! What's that?

1124
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,560
Is that Andrew? Oh, my God!

1125
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,240
Next time on The Women's Island...

1126
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,600
Oh, my God.

1127
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,120
Oh, my God!

1128
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,840
..thoughts turn to food.

1129
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,640
I think a boogie just came out of my nose.

1130
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,320
Eat it, it's worth nothing!

1131
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,920
Oh, my God, there's two piglets!

1132
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,160
The first thing I thought of was crocodile.

1133
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,760
I thought it was me Force Quackling.

1134
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,760
.

1135
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:41,160
.

1136
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,480
.

1137
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,800
.

1138
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,920
.

1139
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
.

1140
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,920
.
