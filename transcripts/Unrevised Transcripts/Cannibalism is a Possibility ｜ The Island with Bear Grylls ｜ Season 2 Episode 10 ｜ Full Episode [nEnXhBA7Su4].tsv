0	14640	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14640	22980	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they
22980	31560	will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools
31560	37800	and fishing equipment how many fishing lines have you hooked up before film filming everything
37800	46980	themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental
46980	52200	strength the winds a day who will have what it takes
52200	52960	to
52960	56980	to stay alive tonight we follow the men's Island
59140	67900	every single time it's little old me I don't trust you survival will be harder than ever
69700	73300	they'll have to endure the height of the harsh tropical storm season
74920	82720	they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food you took the hook of the lot
82960	87600	and these Monday men oh got what it takes to survive
92020	92680	foreign
98260	105700	four weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island hello
105700	109360	you can see Pierce's heart beating through his rib despite their best efforts
110240	110740	so
112960	115680	been able to find a sustainable source of food.
115680	117840	We need some decent food, we need it quick.
119640	122120	And the men are getting weaker by the day.
122120	123040	Exhausted.
123040	125980	There is absolutely no food in this camp.
125980	128580	The group's become increasingly fractured.
128580	130980	You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people
130980	134340	is physically easy and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.
134340	136900	So far, it's 47-year-old Vic,
136900	139920	the island's top hunter, who's managed to save the group
139920	140760	from starvation.
140760	143260	When in doubt, send Vic out!
156660	159880	If I laid back, a little bit further into the sun,
161140	162940	it would feel like I was on holiday.
166020	168420	Apart from the fact that later on,
168420	170580	I'm gonna have to walk half a mile
170580	170740	for one night.
170740	173880	Water, fish until we can eat,
173880	175280	and chop a load of firewood.
178680	183680	Potentially the shittest holiday anyone will ever go on.
193320	196180	The men have now been living on the island for a month.
198080	200560	Unable to find a reliable source of food,
200560	204140	they've had to survive on a meagre low-calorie diet
204140	207540	of limpets, coconut, and the occasional fish.
207540	209740	We are starting to starve.
209740	210680	We're not eating enough.
210680	213540	I mean, look, I've never seen my ribcage like that
213540	216780	since I was bloody 12 or 13.
216780	218700	I've got a bloody lollipop head.
218700	220860	It looks wrong size to my body.
220860	222580	It looks completely out of place.
222580	223680	There's nothing to me.
224600	227700	After four weeks on such an extreme, low-calorie diet,
227700	229700	the men are actually in danger of entering what's called,
229700	232060	autophagy.
232060	234460	And this literally means to self-eat.
234460	236940	Their bodies start to cannibalize themselves,
236940	239200	and if they don't find a sustainable food source
239200	241920	for the long-term, their physical condition
241920	244460	won't just be in decline, it'll be in free fall.
250820	252500	We'll start with Charlie, what are you doing?
252500	253840	I'm building. Phil?
253840	255120	I'm doing water and wood,
255120	257400	and then chipping in for whatever needs doing.
257400	258240	You're man.
258240	261080	For the exhausted men,
261080	263460	the morning meeting has become a vital way
263460	265440	of sharing out their daily chores.
266660	267900	Trapping assistant.
267900	268740	Good man.
268740	269980	Vic's gonna do water, wood,
269980	272820	and help anybody else doing whatever they need doing.
272820	273840	Sam?
273840	275440	The hunting is the thing
275440	277200	that I'm probably the most excited by.
278120	278960	For a personal level,
278960	282640	I don't think I've quite achieved my personal ambition yet.
282640	285380	My personal ambition would be to catch a vulture
285380	286220	or something like that.
286220	287600	It's a lot of effort to do, isn't it?
288240	290240	Will you be doing wood, then?
290240	291960	Well, when I get back, I can do wood, but...
291960	294280	You've got a master skill at avoiding that wood job,
294280	295680	haven't you?
295680	297520	If you don't bust a gut getting wood,
297520	299160	we're gonna run out, and everybody's gonna know
299160	302020	you were on wood, you were a lazy bastard.
302020	304920	The group has given Sam his orders for the day,
304920	306340	but he's not convinced.
307620	309180	Collecting firewood's important,
309180	310920	and I'll do my bit, definitely,
310920	312920	but I'd love to do a bit more hunting.
312920	317320	And, you know, it's that man against beast thing
317320	318160	that I really enjoy.
318240	323240	Yeah, this is not dangerous.
328200	330360	With around 30 liters of water
330360	333380	and up to 50 kilos of firewood to collect,
333380	335660	the men have a grueling morning ahead of them.
336580	339260	This wood is ridiculous.
340260	341100	Go on, man.
341100	341940	Look at this.
341940	342760	Go on, man.
342760	343600	Go on.
345760	346580	Let's roll.
346580	347420	Yay!
348240	349080	Yeah!
349080	349900	Yeah!
354400	356700	Against the express wishes of the group,
356700	359960	Sam has decided to spend the morning bird trapping
359960	361280	instead of chopping wood.
366020	367120	It's quite exciting.
368180	369920	So I'm under a little hide.
370920	373760	Not the best hide in the world, but a hide.
373760	375460	And I've got this little cord here.
375460	380460	And hopefully, the vulture's going to come down,
380460	383420	grab the meat, and I'll pull this rope,
383420	385420	and we'll be in business.
385420	387420	Let's just wait and see.
387420	393420	I work on foreign news stories.
393420	395420	The problem with news is you always go to
395420	397420	some of the nastiest places in the world.
397420	400420	I have been shot at.
400420	402420	I've had a near kidnapping.
402420	404620	But I try to avoid those sort of things as best I can.
404620	408580	I'm aware that I'm incredibly privileged.
408580	410580	You know, I haven't met the queen,
410580	412580	but I have had an amazing opportunity
412580	414580	to meet people from every different sphere of life.
414580	418580	I would hope that I'm not prejudiced.
418580	423580	I do have opinions, but I've got a bit of grace to me.
423580	425540	Dad, I'm hiding for a vulture.
434540	435980	And you're slightly spoiling it.
436580	437580	Where are you?
437580	438580	I'm hiding here.
438580	439580	Ready for a vulture.
440580	443700	Oh, for fuck's sake.
443700	444820	The whole point of the morning meeting
444820	448460	is to get distinct tasks.
448460	449880	If he's got a task,
449880	452860	he needs to complete the task before any passing.
452860	453080	Phe皇 night.
453080	453580	Now...
453580	455340	or it moves on to something else.
455340	456980	Softly, softly is not working anymore,
456980	459780	so we just need to be a bit more firm with people, I think.
461380	463260	Sam, we need you to stick to our tasks,
463260	464700	otherwise we're not gonna get shit done.
464700	466460	It's like nearly 11 o'clock and you haven't done any.
466460	467300	Good to do.
467300	468140	I'm heading there now,
468140	470180	and it's raining coconut for the doom trap as well.
470180	471700	But you're not doing traps, we're doing traps.
471700	472940	You're not doing traps, are you?
472940	475100	You just concentrate on what you're supposed to be doing.
475100	478580	If you've got a task, stick to it, complete it, finish it.
478580	479420	Right.
479420	480260	Good.
480260	484540	I don't know, I don't know.
484540	486060	Bloke Talk's a good, nice, posh game,
486060	488100	but failing to deliver in my book,
488100	491860	and an island where manual graft is king.
491860	494100	We all have to work and sweat.
494100	495700	Oops, now I ain't done jack shit.
501620	503740	Shall I drop this in then, me old brute?
503740	506340	Sam's reluctance to fall in with the others
506340	509020	is starting to affect his reputation in the group.
510260	513020	Do you know, I've given up trying to second-guess Sam Farmer.
513020	516340	He's his own man, he sort of exists in another world.
516340	518260	He's an airhead, isn't he, and he's...
518260	520340	Oh, yes, oh, yeah, er...
520340	521180	Vultures.
521180	523780	Exactly, he must get a bird trap.
523780	527140	And I think everyone feels the bird traps are a waste of time.
530340	532340	There's a bit of selfishness there.
532340	533500	I don't, I think...
533500	535140	But I don't think it means to be selfish,
535140	536940	I just think that's the way it's been brought on.
536940	538780	For me, and this is my opinion,
538780	541740	if that is something that Sam wants to do,
541740	543500	he'll work fucking hard for it.
543500	545100	Agreed. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
545100	547940	I just think he's had his arse wiped for him for the most of his life.
547940	551300	And as a result, he doesn't realise
551300	554540	when he's possibly not mucking in as much as he could do
554540	555820	with others.
557340	559380	A lot of the guys here are kind of like,
559380	563420	I do hard graft, I come from this place, I don't come from that...
563420	565460	And they're a posh voice,
565460	567740	and the fact that they went to Eton,
567740	568580	I think some guys here...
568780	574300	just don't relate to him very well as the men continue to physically decline
574300	578740	the group is becoming fractured and it's as if they're judging each other not
578740	583940	only on their ability to contribute and find food but also in class prejudices
583940	592420	and that's coming to the fore an hour before nightfall a tropical storm hits
592420	600220	the island it's gonna rain it's coming in guys it's gonna rain when it rains it
600220	609280	rains faster it's hard the men have just minutes to secure the camp before it's
609280	611780	washed away
611780	616540	how's the fire Sam need some dry kindling
617540	621740	desperately need to protect the firewood
622420	640920	it's amazing because it's pouring of rain and under those trees it sort of
640920	646780	feels quite dark inside kind of panic don't stop don't stop and you come out
646780	651300	here onto the beach there's an incredible sunset over there and it's
651300	652300	just glistening on the water
652420	656920	the sun's just glistening on the water and it just feels really quite peaceful
656920	661060	actually really quite peaceful moment split some bamboo and we can make a
661060	667060	drain pipe to carry it down to the beach heavens absolutely opened enough to
667060	674800	wash out the entire camp all hands to the deck there are certain times when
674800	679420	some people need to pull their finger out and start working
679420	681420	Oh
682420	688420	I have had some monster fucking bogeys off this island bogeys monsters yeah that
688420	692380	must be one of the biggest bogeys I've ever had in my life eat it no calories
692380	697300	you dirty bastard I mean you're quite welcome to it fella if you want it I'm
697300	703180	absolutely fine thanks Vic I'm not that hungry yet mate very tasty after last night's
703180	708420	vicious storm the men's shelter is in urgent need of repair
708420	710420	I feel like a shire horse
710420	711420	I feel like a shire horse
712420	717800	I see that might work yeah that one never changes peers Dan and Sam Farmer
717800	721860	have been assigned the job of weaving new palms for the roof that's looks
721860	726100	pretty good that's not right it's not you're bending in the wrong way to start
726100	731260	with but Sam's struggling
733660	741160	I'm working now yes sir I don't know abandon my duty but I'm I'm actually
741160	742420	really crap at this weaving I don't want to abandon my duty but I'm actually really crap at this weaving
742420	746680	no one's good at it everyone shitters each other I can't actually get to work
746680	750560	though I spent 45 minutes pat it and I'm obviously doing something wrong you need
750560	753760	a lot more determination Sam just crack on with it just stay with it I've got to
753760	756660	pay to my strengths and one of my strengths isn't plastic
756660	760200	better fucking stick with it
760520	768420	we need to sort it out demand the fuck up anyone fishing now it's too rough
768420	770420	Sam Farmer is...
770420	772420	Sam Farmer is...
772420	778320	shirking some of the harder tasks and it's been noticed by a lot of members of
778320	780600	the group
782300	786500	I think some people in this group were working harder than others I don't want
786500	792620	to point any fingers but Sam I do have a bit of an issue with Sam Farmer at the
792620	797340	minute yeah he's getting under my skin just seems to potter about the place as
797340	802280	if he's looking for his butler sensing the group is starting to turn
802420	809560	against him Sam decides to approach one of his critics I hate tension and when
809560	813820	you can feel that someone's not quite at ease with you I think it's worth
813820	816420	nipping things in the bud early
816420	818420	Sam can I have a quick word?
818420	821420	I feel that you're a bit frustrated with me and I don't want to make a big deal out of it
821420	823420	a little bit man I am
823420	825420	can we talk about it later? I'm busy
825420	826420	actually...
826420	830300	Sam let's talk about it later okay? I'm working well there'll be plenty of time okay?
830300	832300	I'd rather talk it out now because it's in the air
832420	834420	and quite a few people mention it to me
834420	836420	Sam not now okay?
836420	840420	not now please let me finish this later on when we're having some food
840420	841420	five minutes?
841420	845420	no let me get this tree down and maybe okay?
845420	847420	not highly successful
849420	851420	never mind he's not happy
853420	858420	people are having a bit of a go at Sam Farmer and I'm finding it a bit mean really
858420	861420	Sam works really really hard but he works really hard on his own
862420	867420	and a lot of the things he wants to do he's getting a bit sidetracked in that regard
874420	878420	determined to stop the rift between Sam and the group getting any worse
878420	881420	Will takes him aside for a chat
882420	885420	I definitely think I'm putting my weight
885420	889420	but I think it could be perceived that you're doing the things that you want to do
889420	891420	I honestly don't mind what I do
891420	893420	and I know that I can see that
893420	896420	but if you're doing it on your own and no one's noticing
896420	899420	it doesn't get any kudos at all
899420	901420	how bad is the gossip you think?
901420	903420	quite bad
903420	905420	if I'm honest everyone's
907420	910420	it's yeah I mean that's why we're having this conversation
913420	915420	thanks Will thanks very much
917420	919420	the last few days have been quite frustrating
919420	921420	quite a bit of gunning down
921420	924420	I gossip you know what's Sam up to or what's he doing
924420	927420	and it's really hard it's really frustrating
927420	933420	because I really believe I genuinely believe that I'm working as hard as anyone else
933420	937420	and I'm giving my all and I'm putting my back into this
943420	947420	wanting to explain himself to the group Sam calls a meeting
947420	950420	I've actually found the last three weeks quite hard
950420	954420	I found the physical exhaustion that comes with a lack of food
954420	958420	really hard really really really hard
958420	961420	and I wanted to say thank you really first of all
961420	965420	to all you guys for being so amazing
965420	968420	and also for bearing with me
968420	972420	I haven't sort of almost been myself actually as much as I wanted to be myself
976420	979420	back in the big smoke I dare say that bloke's king of the hill
979420	982420	no two ways about it how he talks walks and conducts himself
982420	985420	a great mind's fantastic but we don't need great minds here
985420	988420	we're cavemen we need to sweat blood and guts
988420	992420	and if you're not then it stands out like a blind cobbler's thumb don't it
994420	996420	determined to prove his worth to the others
996420	1000420	Sam has decided to resurrect the group's old fishing nets
1000420	1002420	we have not put one fish in the net yet
1002420	1006420	if we can get these nets out I feel that the sea is our larder
1006420	1010420	but having failed with a net several times already
1010420	1013420	the others aren't convinced by Sam's latest idea
1015420	1019420	these fucking nets waste more energy than anything else
1019420	1023420	the amount of calories and energy people have expended with no return
1023420	1025420	is unbelievable
1026420	1028420	I mean it's just nuts
1033420	1035420	with heavy weights and floats to get into position
1037420	1041420	Sam's enlisted the help of Barney to set the nets
1041420	1043420	Barney I'm smacked here
1043420	1044420	fuck
1046420	1048420	because there are a lot of rocks around here
1049420	1052420	dragging heavy fishing nets out to sea fighting the currents
1052420	1055420	is going to burn through hundreds and hundreds of calories
1057420	1059420	with so little energy in their body
1059420	1062420	for them it's going to probably feel like swimming through treacle
1063420	1064420	ok ready
1064420	1065420	one two three
1066420	1067260	go

1072420	1074420	exhausting
1075420	1077420	after treading water for over an hour
1077420	1080420	Sam and Barney can finally head back to dry land
1085420	1086420	how you going lads
1086420	1087420	where you got chaps
1087420	1089420	absolutely knackered

1092420	1094420	we really really need to have
1094420	1096420	five minutes or ten minutes of rest
1096420	1106520	lie down do I've got some fish for you there he is the islands top fisherman

1159240	1163960	poisonous puffer fish leaving only three to share for lunch between eleven
1163960	1177580	ravenous men it's not gonna feed the 5,000 Sam is convinced his nets are the
1177580	1180240	group's best chance of breaking the famine
1180240	1181140	but it's not the end of the world
1181140	1181180	but it's not the end of the world
1181180	1187500	he can't man them alone I actually came out here to grab Barney for the net
1187500	1191740	there's wood to be got and it's not fair to leave two or three lads doing it
1191740	1197580	but I thought it was a 20-minute job what made you think that have you done a
1197580	1202960	full day on wood yet no that's why you think it's 20 minute job I know I think
1202960	1207340	you've done I think you have rolled them nets up out there and just go for a swim
1207340	1211160	every day listen this is what happened right when we get back we forgot about all these fish
1211180	1211760	surfs and we forgot about all these fish
1211760	1216240	institutional charges all this talk about thethey hate us and all this shit
1216240	1221340	people say to me what do you do and I'll say every day I sweat it as hard as I
1221340	1224640	could and I was just helpful as I could and they'll say Sam what are you doing
1224640	1229160	said it was a nightmare I had to swim every day for some fish

1235080	1240280	yeah mine to bleeds you wait till we get the Teng sting-ray no palate you'll be

1241180	1244060	Down south will work every inch of blood out of us.
1244100	1246620	I thought you were joking. And you'll smile when you do it.
1246660	1248260	There you go. Yeah, go for it, Sam.
1248300	1250100	Finish that baby off. I'll film you, you do it.
1250140	1251140	Yeah, I'd love to.
1254380	1255940	Man's not got a day's graft in him.
1255980	1258660	Not a fricking day's graft in him.
1258700	1260820	I shouldn't be hard on the bloke, because if you've never done it,
1260860	1264620	if you've had your ass wiped all your life, then so be it, you have.
1264660	1265980	Yeah.
1266020	1270060	I think Vic has made a judgement about me that, you know,
1270060	1271540	life's been incredibly easy.
1271580	1273900	And life has been easy in one sense.
1273940	1276380	I've had, you know, an incredible upbringing.
1276420	1280460	I've no embarrassment about the background I've come from
1280500	1284420	or the family I have or the school I went to
1284460	1287700	or the places I've been.
1287740	1289340	They are a huge blessing.
1296620	1298580	Oh, yeah. That's disgusting.
1300060	1302980	After just a few mouthfuls of fish for lunch,
1303020	1306100	tonight's dinner is looking even more bleak.
1306140	1307820	Limpets.
1307860	1310140	There is probably 15 each, you'll be pleased to know.
1312300	1314340	You can all fucking eat your 15 as well.
1316220	1318380	That's fucking horrible.
1318420	1321740	We're eating barely enough to survive.
1321780	1323820	We really need a haul of something,
1323860	1327580	a big catch to come in or an animal to catch.
1327620	1329620	It's so sapping here.
1329620	1332540	And I'm not quite sure how long we can struggle on for
1332580	1333860	without a decent feed.
1336380	1338540	Not too much pressure, but if you don't get any food,
1338580	1340660	we're fucked, yeah, boys? So, yeah, thanks.
1342540	1347340	Now released from wood duty, Sam sets off to check his nets.
1347380	1349180	I'm feeling positive.
1349220	1353820	Despite the group's hostility, Sam's convinced his nets will work.
1353860	1356380	I refuse pessimism to seep in.
1356420	1357460	Absolute refusal.
1357500	1359380	Optimism it is, then. Optimism it is.
1359620	1367900	Sam knows that a big fish haul can mean not only salvation for the group,
1367940	1370380	but would also restore his reputation.
1373460	1375740	It's quite a long way out, isn't it? Yeah, it is.
1389620	1391620	Argh!
1395020	1396100	Nothing.
1397540	1399620	Oh, it's just what I want to hear.
1401940	1404380	It's just so depressing.
1404420	1405740	It's done so much work.
1405780	1407740	Oh...
1407780	1409100	Very predictable.
1409140	1413060	It's a waste of energy, time, fuel, everything.
1413100	1416140	Stop fannying around and start doing something worthwhile.
1418620	1419460	Morning!
1419460	1424660	And what a beautiful marina it is.
1424660	1428800	After a month on the island, the exhausted men are doing their best to share the most
1428800	1430700	arduous daily chores between them.
1430700	1436980	If you keep walking to the kitchen, you're going to find the water, it's almost there.
1436980	1443500	But yesterday, Sam angered the group by prioritising his fishing nets over firewood.
1443500	1450580	Sam checked nets, which brought absolutely diddly squads, I'm afraid to say, a big fat
1450580	1451580	nothing.
1451580	1454860	So there's a bit of tension between the rest of us.
1454860	1457860	Pretty good.
1457860	1462260	OK, let's start off the day.
1462260	1464260	Who's doing what this war is?
1464260	1465740	Yeah, I'm doing fishing net.
1465740	1467740	I know it's a bit selfish.
1467740	1469880	No, just get stuck into wood.
1469880	1471880	Don't make it a token effort.
1471880	1472880	Get stuck into wood.
1472880	1473380	We need wood.
1473500	1474500	Lots of it.
1474500	1476500	The nets aren't delivering jack shit.
1476500	1480500	We're pissing in the wind with them.
1480500	1487620	I do feel put upon, actually, a little bit this morning, just by the comments.
1487620	1488700	It's just maddening.
1488700	1493180	It's absolutely maddening to be criticised and to be put down.
1493180	1494180	It's really, really hard.
1494180	1495180	And I had to be biting my tongue.
1495180	1496180	Let's make a bow, actually.
1496180	1497180	Do you want to talk to them?
1497180	1502880	Yeah, I might have a chat with them.
1502880	1509880	After days of criticism, Sam is determined to get to the bottom of Vic's hostility.
1509880	1510880	Vic?
1510880	1511880	Yeah?
1511880	1512880	Do you trust me?
1512880	1513880	I would never trust a stranger.
1513880	1514880	Am I a stranger?
1514880	1515880	At first, you were.
1515880	1516880	OK.
1516880	1521880	It's taken me longer to get used to you than it has any of the other guys, because they
1521880	1522880	sound a little bit like me.
1522880	1527880	You're the first person I've ever met that actually speaks like this.
1527880	1530880	Am I suffering your prejudice because of a bad experience?
1530880	1531880	From where I come from?
1531880	1532880	From where I come from?
1532880	1533880	Yeah.
1533880	1535880	We vote one, three, four years on a government, yeah?
1535880	1536880	Yeah.
1536880	1538880	And the person we vote for speaks like you.
1538880	1542880	And we put every last vestige of trust in that person.
1542880	1545880	And then you dick us every single time.
1545880	1550880	I have more respect for a man who will break through my front door and steal my telly when
1550880	1555880	I'm on holiday than I do that man that tells me on, that does this and don't point because
1555880	1559880	it's rude and emphasises with his hands, and he's got a great speaking voice and Boris
1559880	1560880	and all that sort of shit.
1560880	1565880	I have no respect whatsoever because they are thieving, lying, clever people with affluence
1565880	1568880	and money and a good voice and a fantastic education.
1568880	1571880	Vic, you're basically saying you're all the same.
1571880	1572880	That's what you're basically saying.
1572880	1577880	But yes, which is perhaps lack of education, lack of understanding, lack of experience.
1577880	1580880	Which is because I'm trapped in a working class life.
1580880	1584880	People with power and influence, they just abuse the little man every time.
1584880	1586880	Do you assume I do have power and influence?
1586880	1588880	I mean, it's little old me.
1588880	1590880	It's little old me.
1590880	1594880	But it's difficult to get rid of all them years of listening to people with accent
1594880	1598880	and class, tell you one thing and do a totally different thing because then you don't trust
1598880	1599880	them at all.
1599880	1601880	So unfortunately, I don't trust you.
1601880	1602880	Yeah.
1604880	1605880	Interesting.
1611880	1612880	It was hard to hear.
1612880	1614880	I hate conflict.
1614880	1617880	I have a choice, either just to try and ignore it.
1617880	1625880	Or I can try and embrace it and show him that actually I'm very different from those
1625880	1628880	that have put him down in the past.
1628880	1633880	And my hope is that he will see me by the end of this experiment.
1633880	1636880	He will see me as a person who's on his side.
1637880	1642880	For centuries, you know, the British have been totally class driven, almost class obsessed.
1642880	1647880	And it's like a pathological disorder where people get fixated on what they're doing.
1647880	1650880	Where they feel they stand in that pecking order.
1650880	1652880	Are they lower, middle or upper classes?
1652880	1657880	But if the men are going to survive here, they've got to put aside those prejudices
1657880	1658880	and work as a team.
1664880	1665880	Right, people.
1665880	1667880	The fishing wheel will go.
1667880	1668880	I'm away, boys.
1668880	1670880	Catch some supper.
1670880	1672880	Let's have some fish.
1672880	1674880	We can all have a decent meal.
1675880	1676880	With nothing to eat in camp.
1676880	1680880	The starving men have decided to use their last reserves of energy
1680880	1684880	on one big concerted effort to find food.
1684880	1686880	Jesus Christ.
1686880	1688880	Oh, fuck, yes.
1688880	1689880	Get him.
1689880	1690880	Get him.
1690880	1691880	Got him, got him, got him.
1694880	1695880	Fuck.
1695880	1696880	OK.
1696880	1698880	Oh, his tail snapped off.
1698880	1700880	Didn't a bloody snake do that?
1703880	1705880	Despite opposition from the rest of the group,
1705880	1708880	Sam has decided to persevere with his nets.
1710880	1712880	You just have to keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.
1712880	1715880	Sometimes you fail, and sometimes you're successful.
1719880	1721880	We have a first victim down there.
1721880	1723880	Oh, you say then?
1723880	1724880	Being the top fish catcher.
1724880	1725880	Pressure's on.
1725880	1727880	Yeah, the pressure is on.
1727880	1731880	But I also think the mark of a man is in rising to pressure.
1731880	1733880	We still haven't got anything, anything,
1733880	1737880	anything, anything.
1737880	1740880	Desperately, desperately need food.
1740880	1746880	After five exhausting hours, the men have found nothing for dinner.
1746880	1748880	Jesus Christ, look at the fucking...
1748880	1751880	You bastard!
1751880	1754880	Took the hook and the lot.
1754880	1755880	That's bad.
1755880	1756880	Fuck all.
1756880	1761880	Even the island's top fisherman, Vic, has had to admit defeat.
1761880	1762880	Son of a bitch.
1762880	1764880	I'm gutted.
1764880	1767880	I really wanted to bring in a nice haul for guys tonight to eat,
1767880	1769880	do you know what I mean?
1769880	1770880	Fuck!
1773880	1776880	Exhausted, starving hungry and despondent,
1776880	1778880	the men gather back in camp.
1778880	1780880	So what's the plan, guys?
1780880	1782880	Try not to slash my wrist.
1782880	1785880	Without a single scrap of food to show for a day's hunting,
1785880	1787880	the group are out of options.
1789880	1791880	Save one unlikely potential saviour.
1793880	1796880	What would you feel about all of us getting the net in today?
1798880	1801880	Let's say after this meeting, we all troop down there.
1801880	1803880	I mean, I'm being a bit hopeful.
1803880	1804880	How do we empty the nets?
1804880	1805880	You've got to bring them in.
1805880	1806880	Going to have to pull them in.
1806880	1809880	Ooh, fuck it, I'll fight.
1809880	1811880	I think it'd be quite good if we could pull together
1811880	1813880	and get these things done.
1813880	1814880	Yeah, fuck it, count me in.
1814880	1815880	Two crack on?
1815880	1816880	Fair enough.
1819880	1820880	Yes, I'll come in the water and pull a net, yeah?
1820880	1821880	Brilliant. Brilliant.
1821880	1822880	Sounds good to me.
1822880	1823880	Yeah. Yeah?
1823880	1824880	Sounds good.
1824880	1825880	Ready to go?
1825880	1826880	Go.
1828880	1829880	Come on, boys.
1829880	1830880	Bring home the bacon.
1830880	1831880	Bring home the fish.
1831880	1833880	That's some fishies.
1833880	1838880	In desperation, the men agree to give Sam's nets a final chance.
1838880	1840880	If you don't give up, I'll give him that blessing.
1840880	1843880	But they are now making a dangerous gamble
1843880	1845880	with their last reserves of energy.
1848880	1850880	Please be fishing this net.
1850880	1852880	OK, are you ready?
1852880	1853880	Ready, ready.
1853880	1854880	One, two...
1863880	1865880	Yes!
1867880	1868880	Nowhere!
1869880	1872880	There's a lot of whooping coming from those nets, people.
1876880	1877880	Where do you go, lads?
1877880	1878880	Fuck me.
1878880	1879880	Hooray!
1880880	1882680	How many do you think you've got, Sam?
1882680	1883680	I don't know.
1883680	1885680	Jesus Christ.
1885680	1890680	That's the first one, boys.
1890680	1891680	Oh, yeah.
1891680	1892680	Yeah?
1892680	1894680	Oh, there's the second one, boys.
1894680	1898680	And the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.
1898680	1899680	Oh, God.
1899680	1900680	I'm telling you.
1900680	1902680	Look at them coming out.
1902680	1903680	Yeah!
1903680	1904680	Woo!
1904680	1905680	Ah!

1920680	1921680	Yeah!
1921680	1922680	Yeah!
1922680	1923680	Yeah!
1923680	1924680	Yeah!
1924680	1925680	Yeah!
1925680	1926680	Come on!
1926680	1927680	Yeah!
1927680	1930680	Fucking awesome, man.
1930680	1931680	Well done, man.
1931680	1932680	Well done.
1932680	1933680	Well done, fella.
1933680	1934680	Well done.
1934680	1935680	Well done, mate.
1935680	1938680	Fucking excellent.
1938680	1939680	I have a new family.
1939680	1940680	I respect.
1940680	1941680	I really do.
1941680	1942680	That is brilliant.
1942680	1943680	That was the hardest thing I've done in a long time.
1943680	1944680	Fuck!
1944680	1945680	A big fishy hook for the old man and the fish.
1945680	1946680	Get in there, boys.
1946680	1947680	Get in there.
1947680	1948680	Thank you, Vic.
1948680	1949680	Thank you.
1949680	1950680	Very kind.
1950680	1951680	Finally, the net's come good.
1951680	1952680	And that's all Sam Farmer's doing.
1952680	1953680	He's been working tirelessly to get that.
1953680	1954680	I think that Sam's going to be kind of accepted as more a part of the team now.
1954680	1955680	Shit, love.
1955680	1956680	Shit.
1956680	1957680	That looks heavy.
1957680	1958680	Yeah.
1958680	1959680	Yeah.
1959680	1960680	Yeah.
1960680	1961680	Yeah.
1961680	1962680	Yeah.
1962680	1963680	Yeah.
1963680	1964680	Yeah.
1964680	1965680	Yeah.
1965680	1966680	Yeah.
1966680	1967680	Yeah.
1967680	1968680	Yeah.
1968680	1969680	Yeah.
1969680	1970680	That looks heavy.
1970680	1971680	Okay, guys.
1971680	1972680	The first fish.
1972680	1973680	Yes.
1974680	1975680	Second.
1975680	1976680	Hello.
1976680	1977680	Good size.
1977680	1978680	Third.
1978680	1979680	Second.
1979680	1980680	All I wanted was just a fish.
1980680	1981680	One fish.
1981680	1983680	How many fishes have we got?
1983680	1984680	Twenty-one!
1984680	1985680	Gentlemen of the net.
1985680	1986680	Well done, guys.
1986680	1987680	Twenty-one little fishies.
1987680	1988680	Oh, yeah.
1988680	1989680	Oh, yeah.
1989680	1990680	Oh, yeah.
1990680	1991680	Oh, yeah.
1991680	1992680	Oh, yeah.
1992680	1993680	Oh, yeah.
1993680	1994680	Oh, yeah.
1994680	1995680	Oh, yeah.
1995680	1996680	Oh, yeah.
1996680	1997680	Oh, yeah.
1997680	1998680	Oh, yeah.
1998680	2007520	remark
2009740	2011680	Dishes for the dishes.
2011680	2012680	Dinner is ready, boy.
2012680	2013680	Nice.
2013680	2014680	It just goes to show you, the reality is, in a survival situation, it's the ultimate
2014680	2015680	systematic leveler, there's only one class that matters, survival class.
2015680	2019420	Sam's determination has been amazing with MNets.
2019420	2021780	I am really happy that you can see that.
2021780	2023520	Yes, I couldn't.
2023520	2024520	I won't deny it.
2024520	2025540	I couldn't see it at all.
2025540	2027680	I just thought, well, you're a big city.
2027680	2030240	But the big city fan, he's done good.
2031480	2034160	Sam Farmer, my heart comes off to you, sir.
2034160	2036480	Well done, you, for having the balls and the determination
2036480	2037920	to fix them every time,
2037920	2041480	because that certainly weren't my cup of tea at all.
2041480	2044160	Well done, him. Thank you.
2044160	2045960	I'd just like to say a massive thanks
2045960	2049440	and a raise like any other to Sam Farmer.
2049440	2051080	Sam Farmer!
2051080	2053520	Well done, big fella. Founder of the Fishy Feast.
2053520	2054880	Here we are. Here we are.
2054880	2056280	Well made at last, fella.
2057680	2062680	Last night, the men had a hearty 21-fish supper,
2062680	2064680	thanks to Sam Farmer's nets.
2066200	2069200	But following the feast, 36-year-old Will
2069200	2071680	is the only member of the group who's out of bed.
2072680	2074480	It's, uh...
2074480	2076560	Up past eight, no-one's awake.
2076560	2077960	They're gonna make a lot of noise.
2077960	2079280	It's up past eight.
2079280	2080920	Sun's been up for two and a half hours.
2080920	2083920	Normally, I'd finish our morning meeting by now.
2083920	2084920	So...
2084920	2087360	Will's worried the men aren't making the most
2087360	2087640	of the feast.
2087680	2090680	They're worried about the energy they got from last night's meal.
2092680	2094680	I take it we're all going up.
2094680	2095680	Morning!
2099400	2101680	I'm glad you woke me up, pal. I'd have slept in.
2103680	2104680	Morning.
2105680	2109680	This is a complete one-off, unique opportunity.
2111680	2116680	I want to wring out every last possible experience out of it.
2117680	2120680	I think we need a general camp wake-up call.
2120680	2123680	It was half past eight and most people were still in bed.
2123680	2125680	We sat round this campfire every night and said,
2125680	2127680	oh, yeah, I want to go romping round the island,
2127680	2129680	I want to catch a piggy, I want to get caiman,
2129680	2131680	I want to do traps, I want to do this, I want to do that,
2131680	2135680	doing all these things, but two and a half hours of daylight's gone.
2135680	2137680	You know, I think it's just a bit of a shame.
2137680	2140680	Are you insisting we get up? No, I'm not insisting.
2140680	2142680	I know somebody was upset this morning
2142680	2145680	because it was a crescendo of boom, boom, boom, for an hour.
2145680	2147480	You can bang boxes and kick and...
2147680	2149680	It's all you want. We're all grown-ups.
2149680	2151680	Nobody's telling me what time to get up.
2151680	2153680	I know, I'm not telling you... I am finished.
2153680	2155680	Nobody's telling me what time to get up. I'll get up when I'm getting up.
2155680	2157680	Vic, you're making it sound like I was doing that on purpose
2157680	2159680	to try and wake you up. No, not at all. Were you?
2159680	2161680	No, of course not. Then why would I think that?
2161680	2164680	I just laid there laughing, thinking, that's quite funny.
2164680	2166680	You be making noises, you be wanting us to wake up,
2166680	2168680	me wanting us to wake up at half past eight,
2168680	2170680	you were banging boxes and crashing and banging,
2170680	2172680	and I was laughing to myself.
2172680	2174680	I'm going to stay in bed and prove a point.
2175680	2176680	A bit childish.
2177680	2179680	How old are you?
2182680	2184680	11am.
2184680	2187680	The men finally crack on with the day's business.
2187680	2189680	We've got a fish!
2190680	2192680	Having been out overnight,
2192680	2195680	Sam Farmer's nets are continuing to bear fruit.
2195680	2197680	There's another fish below you as well.
2197680	2199680	Oh, my God, this is awesome.
2199680	2203680	I tell you what, we've got enough fish to eat tonight, so that's good.
2203680	2206680	How was it? Awesome. Absolutely awesome.
2207680	2209680	They're both grinning like Cheshire cats.
2209680	2211680	It's got to be good news.
2211680	2212680	The bag is full.
2212680	2214680	A bit of a tiddler, sorry.
2214680	2215680	Yeah!
2215680	2217680	The yellowfiller bag!
2217680	2218680	I want tuna!
2218680	2219680	I love tuna.
2219680	2222680	That net's working treat for them, isn't it?
2222680	2224680	Big tuna.
2224680	2226680	Ooh, another different type of tuna.
2226680	2227680	18.
2227680	2228680	18.
2228680	2230680	Right, filleting.
2233680	2236680	The key is in the care of these tuna is the firmness of the flesh, see?
2236680	2237680	Yeah.
2237680	2239680	Yeah, see, that's gone. Sorry, boys.
2240680	2241680	That is gone.
2243680	2247680	The men are paying a heavy price for their late start to the day.
2247680	2249680	Oh, look at that.
2249680	2251680	We have wasted a lot of fish today
2251680	2253680	because we have got pulleys in too late.
2253680	2255680	Yeah, we don't know. A lot of fish.
2255680	2257680	And this one as well.
2257680	2260680	At the moment, I'm having a real problem with fish getting caught in the net
2260680	2261680	going rotten.
2261680	2265680	You put the nets overnight, the fish could have been caught at one in the morning,
2265680	2267680	they could have been caught at 11 last night.
2267680	2269680	All of a sudden, you get to 10 o'clock this morning,
2269680	2273680	you've been sat in a net for 12 hours going off.
2273680	2276680	It's 11 o'clock and we've only just pulled the fish in.
2276680	2278680	I think we need to get out of bed.
2278680	2279680	Faster.
2279680	2280680	Get out of bed earlier, yeah.
2280680	2282680	I think we'll just have a morning call.
2282680	2285680	Go, right, 7.30, everyone up.
2285680	2287680	I don't want to waste any more fish
2287680	2288680	because we can't be bothered getting out of bed
2288680	2290680	and now checking the nets.
2293680	2294680	Once again,
2294680	2297680	the group's food situation looks bleak.
2297680	2299680	You need to head around this bit.
2299680	2302680	With no food in camp, fishing with a rod and line
2302680	2305680	is now the men's best hope of catching something for dinner.
2305680	2308680	Don't be too long, mate. We've got a long way back, yeah?
2308680	2311680	Will is an incredible man for his energy
2311680	2315680	and his ability to keep not just motivated
2315680	2319680	but to keep the enthusiasm to follow his ideas through
2319680	2322680	when he's running on empty just like the rest of us.
2322680	2323680	It's really quite impressive.
2325680	2327680	I'm going to head around, OK?
2329680	2331680	To get to the best fishing spot,
2331680	2334680	they must navigate the island's treacherous coastline
2334680	2336680	at high tide.
2338680	2341680	I think one of the most critical skills in survival generally
2341680	2345680	is just awareness, you know, an ability to kind of assess
2345680	2348680	and just take your time and think through things
2348680	2349680	before you actually act.
2352680	2353680	But here's the danger.
2353680	2357680	The more malnourished, the more their judgement gets impaired
2357680	2359680	and that's when they can end up taking risks
2359680	2361680	that can put their lives in jeopardy.
2363680	2365680	Your house is looking a bit tasty down there, isn't it?
2368680	2371680	Stop, mate. Stop.
2371680	2373680	Have we left it a bit late?
2373680	2376680	Right, boys, this is where it's going to get naughty.
2376680	2380680	Whoo! It's like that big diving board in Sheffield Arena.
2380680	2381680	Too high.
2381680	2382680	Too high.
2383680	2384680	What's happening, mate?
2386680	2388680	We've got some big ones coming, so let's wait.
2388680	2390680	The idea is to watch them coming in,
2390680	2392680	wait for a flat spot and go for it.
2393680	2394680	Hold!
2395680	2396680	Hold!
2399680	2400680	There he's gone!
2401680	2402680	Back!
2404680	2405680	Oh, shit!
2407680	2408680	There!
2408680	2409680	Whoo-hoo!
2409680	2413680	Right, step, step, hand, yeah?
2417680	2418680	Well done.
2419680	2420680	Next!
2420680	2421680	One pierce.
2421680	2423680	Now pierce. Push off.
2423680	2425680	Push off, push off, push off.
2425680	2426680	Hand, hand, hand.
2426680	2428680	There we go. Bingo, Stella.
2428680	2430680	Whoo! Big whirl!
2430680	2432680	Well, if I were you, I'd come a bit further along.
2432680	2433680	Camera.
2433680	2434680	I can go all the way around.
2434680	2436680	There's no hole. There's no hole.
2436680	2437680	You can't get all the way around.
2437680	2438680	Wrong incline.
2439680	2441680	Vic, I'll not be able to make this with the camera.
2441680	2443680	That's OK. I'm just ready for you coming along.
2443680	2444680	Vic, go across, yeah?
2444680	2445680	Steady away.
2446680	2448680	That's fine. Easy to do that.
2448680	2449680	You all right?
2449680	2450680	Yep.
2452680	2453680	Fucking Jesus.
2454680	2455680	Be careful!
2456680	2457680	Turn around, face the rocks.
2459680	2460680	Yeah, check for loose rocks.
2461680	2463680	Right, aim for the hand, aim for the hand.
2463680	2465680	Keep hold, keep hold, keep hold.
2465680	2466680	There you go, there you go, there you go.
2469680	2470680	Holy shit!
2477680	2478680	You OK? You OK?
2478680	2479680	OK.
2479680	2480680	OK, just come up.
2480680	2481680	Get the fucking camera off!
2481680	2482680	I'm sorry.
2482680	2483680	Get the fucking camera off.
2483680	2484680	I'm sorry.
2484680	2486680	Stay still. Stay still.
2486680	2487680	Are you OK?
2487680	2488680	Give me a, give me a...
2490680	2492680	Let's get off the danger area and then assess the catch,
2492680	2493680	OK?
2494680	2495680	OK, that's nasty.
2495680	2502680	Will is losing blood and is in a state of shock.
2502680	2505680	Let's move on before we get stuck again, OK?
2505680	2506680	Yep.
2507680	2510680	Dr Pearce needs to get him back to camp urgently
2510680	2512680	so he can examine the injury properly.
2515680	2516680	Son of a bitch.
2517680	2520680	I tell you what, that was a massive fall.
2520680	2521680	Totally unexpected.
2522680	2524680	To see that cut was pretty scary.
2525680	2526680	We'll get your blood done.
2526680	2527680	Yeah.
2527680	2528680	OK.
2528680	2529680	Will.
2529680	2530680	Will.
2530680	2531680	Dude.
2531680	2532680	It's actually quite serious.
2532680	2533680	Nice house.
2533680	2534680	Oh, shit.
2534680	2536680	Dr Pearce can finally make a proper assessment.
2536680	2538680	What is that you can see underneath it?
2538680	2541680	Is that muscle or is that bone?
2541680	2545680	I think he's severed one of his tendons.
2545680	2546680	It's bad.
2546680	2547680	I mean,
2547680	2550680	I wouldn't be happy just to patch that up here.
2550680	2551680	No, I wouldn't either.
2551680	2552680	No.
2552680	2553680	Oh.
2553680	2554680	No.
2554680	2556640	is to patch that up here.
2556640	2559880	That needs a surgical exploration in an operating theatre.
2566680	2570320	If I have to go, I'm really devastated.
2575160	2576880	And at the end of the day, Will,
2576880	2580720	remember you're right-handed, it's your livelihood,
2580720	2584720	and we've got to be sensible and realistic.
2587520	2589800	Fuck. Not good at all, this.
2591600	2592880	OK, guys.
2595680	2599360	Just give me a minute, yeah? Give me a minute, lads.
2603760	2606960	He's such a valued part of our team.
2606960	2610240	If he leaves, I would totally feel gutted.
2610240	2610680	So I'm dead.
2610680	2612960	I'm really desperate for him to stay with us.
2615280	2617640	Knowing Will's injury is serious,
2617640	2621960	Dr Pearce has no option but to call the emergency paramedic team
2621960	2623320	for a second opinion.
2623320	2625400	Do you think he's gone off your arms?
2625400	2626920	I do, yeah.
2626920	2628800	I want him to go, in fact.
2628800	2633280	It's something that can't be dealt with on the island, OK?
2633280	2634880	You need a surgeon that's trained,
2634880	2637320	you need a sterile operating theatre.
2637320	2638600	It's real no-braining.
2640680	2642360	He's gone quite deep.
2642360	2643840	Is it Gors there? OK.
2647840	2650400	Injury is muscular and not just superficial,
2650400	2651840	so he needs to be evacuated.
2651840	2653000	OK, hold on.
2653000	2654400	ASAP, Ella.
2654400	2656240	Get your stuff together, OK?
2656240	2657480	All right, fantastic.
2657480	2659040	Keep those for me, guys.
2663040	2666840	After five weeks on the island, Will's time is over.
2666840	2670000	Smallest things, and it's just a simple fall like that,
2670000	2672200	and it's cut my experience off.
2679200	2680960	Oh, mate, I'm so fucking sorry.
2684960	2687440	You've been a fucking hero, mate, you really have.
2687440	2689360	Guys, we need to go right now.
2689360	2690920	I don't care what anyone says,
2690920	2692960	we've effectively had a leader out here,
2692960	2694480	and it's been Will's best effort.
2694480	2696000	He's done it. He's done it.
2696000	2698760	It's been Will's best effort here, and it's been Will's.
2698760	2702840	He's led by example, he's led by inspiration.
2702840	2704800	Thank you, buddy.
2704800	2707480	When people can't be asked or don't want to do something,
2707480	2711080	he's done it himself, and he's filmed the whole thing as well.
2711080	2712960	The man-spinning machine.
2712960	2715280	I think we'll regress to kind of ape men.
2715280	2716320	Will now, he's gone.
2719320	2720640	See you soon, Will!
2723400	2725720	Oh, he's got a sub on, hasn't he? Bless him.
2726000	2727600	Yeah, I think he's upset.
2729200	2730600	See you soon!
2731600	2733400	Good luck, Will. Good luck.
2735400	2737120	All right, fella? Yeah.
2737120	2739280	Yeah? No, listen, it's how it works.
2739280	2741080	You did your best, that's how it works.
2744880	2749680	I never imagined that I'd be so gutted,
2749680	2753880	so disappointed, so kind of upset with one of us leaving.
2756000	2759200	Especially in the last few days, I've gotten with him so well,
2759200	2761200	and I've really made a really good friend of him.
2766600	2769840	Next time, on the final instalment of The Women's Island...
2769840	2772680	No supper for us tonight.
2772680	2773920	I'm starved.
2773920	2776320	You're doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah. What?!
2776320	2778840	We are completely dysfunctional as a group.
2778840	2780040	We need leadership.
2780040	2781800	Well, you're not here for the team any more.
2781800	2783840	Are you trying to start an argument? I'm asking that for you.
2783840	2785840	You are trying to start an argument. Do you know what?
2785840	2788040	Jamie, you're a fucking fag.
2788040	2790440	We're going to end up killing each other by the end of this.
2815840	2821400	It's going to get really bad.
2821400	2823720	I'm telling you, I can't get over it.
2823720	2825080	It's about onions, not onions.
2825080	2826000	I know the onions.
2826000	2829640	Theyrada was dead, she's dead, but she's alive.
2829640	2832000	Well, I don't have a lot of diamonds.
2832000	2833760	Next time on, you know, thoroughly ousted children?
2833760	2835200	That's right, I'm going to end up with them all.
2835200	2836640	You don't know what it's gonna be like.
2836640	2839840	him des bic cam reported he will quietly leave the gym.
2839840	2841640	He is ollut since the beginning.
2841640	2842880	That's a shame.
2842880	2844440	What do you mean?
2844440	2845640	What?
