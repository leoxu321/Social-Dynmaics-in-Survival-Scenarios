1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,920
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,560
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in fishing equipment and a handful of

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:38,920
basic tools filming everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:49,540
be brute power or mental strength the winds a day daddy brought home the Baker who will have

6
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:58,080
what it takes to stay alive tonight is the final installment of the women's I don't want to be on

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,540
camera today anybody

8
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:09,380
survival will be harder than ever the search for food is now a matter of life and death

9
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,660
it's a joke living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season

10
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:26,060
I think we are on our last leg when pitted against the extremes of nature with the finishing line in

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,540
sight these Monday women are

12
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,540
they just sleeping on a bit of ice an april 18th it's just a cold slide you've got to find

13
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,380
the hot potato first've got what it takes to survive I'll do what I'm wanting to do

14
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,120
I understand and go I'm not going to do it let me finish as usual arguments of the staff seeds

15
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,660
why cant you fucking know here and the baby fucking soon

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,400
After nearly five weeks of heat followed by a haberdam program which was a result of the

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,540
on the island the ten remaining women were on the verge of failure they were

18
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,420
dangerously dehydrated and had an urgent medical warning all the plug on this

19
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,220
that their lives were at risk in scary territory where we just don't know

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,440
what's happening to our bodies but they pulled themselves back from the brink

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:32,800
now entering their sixth week surviving on the island food in the camp vicinity

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
is running out the starving women face a battle to make it to the end

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:49,540
desperate for something to eat

24
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,080
Becky

25
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,420
Julie

26
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,420
and Georgie brave the vicious incoming tide to scavenge the last remaining oysters.

27
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:39,620
Oh, bloody hell. Today I'm feeling like absolute shit. I know that I keep saying I feel like

28
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:48,620
shit, but today I feel like dried white dog poo shit.

29
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,400
Since they've arrived on the island, the starving women have shed more than 140 pounds.

30
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,400
between them. The weight of an average woman.

31
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,160
Our coconut supply is running low. Our yucca around here is non-existent. The limes have

32
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,960
now gone. The almond fruits that grow on the trees here, we've eaten all of those.

33
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,080
Oh, they stink.

34
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,300
For six weeks, vegetarian Jamie has been surviving on nothing but nuts and coconuts.

35
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,300
As soon as I get off here, I need to get as much protein in me as I can.

36
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,380
Yeah.

37
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:31,480
I just had a day, but you'll get a big fat sausage in you as soon as you get off here.

38
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Sometimes I do eat meat, but only the sausage variety. Sometimes I like a bit of chorizo,

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
but I don't like them chipolatas.

40
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,940
Here, let me help you.

41
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,480
With food so scarce around camp, the rest of the women are having to rely solely on

42
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,280
the fishing net they've set in the shallows.

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Oh, I think that's something in the net.

44
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It's a shark.

45
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

46
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
That is unbelievable.

47
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,280
All right, got him. Quick, he's getting away.

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
No, he's got a way. He's got a way. He's got a way.

49
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Oh, damn. Damn, damn, damn.

50
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
No supper for us tonight.

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,180
There's 10 of us, and I think we are on our last legs.

52
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,180
I think we are on our last legs.

53
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,180
When Mother Nature slams that larder door firmly shut,

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,180
things in a group can rapidly go downhill.

55
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,180
You're hungry, you're despondent, and it's so tempting to give up.

56
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,180
But like so many things in life and in the wild,

57
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,180
it's actually about how you respond to those crisis moments.

58
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,180
I've literally been up almost all night just trying to keep that fire alive.

59
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,180
From day one, the women have governed themselves in a leaderless community,

60
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
trying to make group decisions.

61
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,180
What, was there not enough wood? Have we run out of wood now?

62
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,180
We ran out of wood last night, and everyone went to...

63
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
You're joking. Yeah.

64
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
People just know they need to fucking get wood.

65
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,180
End of story. That's the bit that I don't get.

66
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,180
There's no leader. Not one person rules the roost.

67
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,180
We work collectively, so we have to kind of use our initiative

68
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
and work off the average.

69
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,180
So if, say, I want to go foraging,

70
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,180
I don't have to be told to go foraging.

71
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
I'm going to go foraging.

72
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,180
All the decisions we've made thus far have been made elaboratively.

73
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,180
We've not needed to conform to a system where there's a leader.

74
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,180
The women need to survive seven more days on the island.

75
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Any hope of dinner depends entirely on catching fish.

76
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
The women are yet to be found.

77
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,180
It's time to establish a rota for checking the nets,

78
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
and Julie has made a discovery.

79
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,180
The net is in a right mess.

80
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,180
It's just... It's curled over that tight.

81
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
There's no teamwork.

82
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
There's no organisation.

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
There's... Nobody wants responsibility for anything.

84
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,180
Holy shit. It's an absolute state.

85
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
I mean, have you seen that?

86
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,180
It's crested, it's crested, it's crested.

87
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,180
High, stormy seas have destroyed their last hope

88
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
of getting something to eat.

89
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,180
Fishing is the only thing that we survive off at the minute.

90
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
We need to get it sorted ASAP.

91
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
It's just getting more and more tangled.

92
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,180
Yeah, I know, but just pulling it like that's going to rip it, isn't it?

93
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
No, it's not.

94
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Well, it is when... I can feel it.

95
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Well...

96
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,180
I'll just wait until we've used it.

97
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Stop being a stroppy cow, Jamie. What's up with you?

98
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
Where's Jamie gone?

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Fucking want to get fucking off here.

100
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
It better be fucking soon.

101
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,180
I would say I've had a hard life growing up.

102
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,180
My mum's got MS and she's been in a care home.

103
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,180
She's always said to me to basically live life to the full

104
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,180
because she's never been able to do the things that I've done.

105
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
It's made me...

106
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,180
It's made me extremely independent.

107
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
So if someone was to start bossing me about,

108
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,180
it would make me really upset and probably make me really angry.

109
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
I'll do what I want, when I want.

110
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,180
I don't want anybody telling me what to do, bossing me about.

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Fed up.

112
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,180
We have to do things that, you know, we don't always want to do,

113
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
but it's for the team.

114
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,180
I've had enough of fucking everything!

115
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,180
It really is shit!

116
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,180
If anything's going to make me leave this island,

117
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,180
it's the people.

118
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,180
It's not like a team work.

119
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,180
Well, darling, I mean, I don't know what to say to you other than,

120
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,180
you know, I completely agree.

121
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,180
I thought we were all going to be a team and pull together and...

122
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
It's not like that at all, is it?

123
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
It's absolutely not like that at all.

124
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,180
The effects of starvation on the body are not just physical.

125
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,180
Extreme hunger makes people desperate, depressed, irritable,

126
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,180
and all the negative emotions that women are experiencing

127
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
will be amplified.

128
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,180
And if there are rifts emerging now, what hunger will do,

129
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,180
it will act like a crowbar, forcing those rifts further apart.

130
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,180
So, what's everybody doing? Can we just make it clear?

131
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Nobody's taken responsibility to set a fire rotor,

132
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,180
so it's left to Beth and Lauren again to keep the embers going through the night.

133
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,180
I'm sorting out the fire. You're sorting out your socks.

134
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
While Jamie has slept.

135
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I think you should help.

136
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,180
Right, well, do you know what I can't be doing with this?

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Literally, you've got to bend over and get a fucking twig.

138
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Well, just stop fucking bossing me about, right?

139
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
Look, there's Rose here.

140
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,180
I want to show my daughter that I can be brave.

141
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,180
I want to show her that there are endless possibilities

142
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
and a woman can do anything.

143
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,180
I'm hoping we're all going to group together and be a team,

144
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
especially because it's just a group of women.

145
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,180
I think we've all got a little bit of something to prove.

146
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
I will help when I'm ready.

147
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,180
I've been up all night with the frigging fire.

148
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
And I'm tired too.

149
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
And you're saying...

150
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
You're sitting there sorting out your fucking feet.

151
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
I've got socks on.

152
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Whatever.

153
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Fucking laziness. It's outrageous.

154
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,180
It's absolutely outrageous.

155
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,180
We're all a bit fed up with Jamie. There, I've said it.

156
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,180
It's really making me frustrated.

157
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
And...

158
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
..every time I stop,

159
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,180
I feel like people are looking at me.

160
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Actually, you know,

161
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,180
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...

162
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
I don't know, but I think we're going to end up killing each other

163
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
by the end of this, I really do.

164
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,180
We are completely dysfunctional as a group.

165
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,180
I find that deeply upsetting and deeply frustrating

166
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,180
that we're led by mush.

167
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,180
We need a leadership to get ourself together,

168
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
to get our food sorted,

169
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,180
and we just can't live from this sort of hand-to-mouth,

170
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,180
piecemeal way.

171
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,180
More thought needs to be going into this, for sure.

172
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Lauren and Beth call an emergency meeting.

173
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,180
We're working for democracy and, you know, things are pretty positive.

174
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,180
Something...something has gone wrong somewhere.

175
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
What do you think has gone wrong?

176
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
We're literally starved.

177
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,180
The group feels fragmented and that we're not a unit.

178
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
I don't know how that fire's managed to keep going.

179
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,180
It's literally by luck and coincidence that we keep rocking up,

180
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,180
going, oh, fuck, the fire's literally just about to go out,

181
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,180
and, oh, God, I've just got that jab of water.

182
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
You know, it's basically lack of structure

183
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,180
because then we have lack of food and it's kind of a knock-on effect.

184
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,180
I think, personally, we need to decide on a leader

185
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,180
to set out what is needed and a plan of action.

186
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I can hear you're really passionate, Georgie, and I totally get it,

187
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
but I think, for me, we collapse.

188
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,180
For me, we collaboratively lead the group.

189
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Harvey, that system is not working because we've done that

190
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
and I think we're stumbling from one day to the next

191
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
and now we're in crises.

192
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,180
I'm with Harvey here. Why is it necessary to have the leader?

193
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Because the leader knows where everything is.

194
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,180
The leader will lead you and go, right, OK, these are the priorities.

195
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Why should I let somebody boss me about and tell me what to do?

196
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,180
I'll do what I want to do.

197
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,180
You cannot stand there and go, I'm going to do what I want to do

198
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
and if someone's telling me what to do, I'm not going to do it.

199
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
But we all need to come together.

200
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Exactly, the arguments have started already.

201
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
It's not an argument, Jamie.

202
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,180
This is what happens when you try and elect leaders.

203
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,180
SHE GASPS

204
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
This is what I didn't want.

205
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
I know, I know.

206
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,180
The last few days.

207
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,180
This is what I didn't want.

208
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Trying to improve their destructive group dynamic,

209
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
it is important for the women.

210
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,180
Now they've turned on each other,

211
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,180
they've pushed their very survival back into jeopardy

212
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,180
and without decisive leadership, they won't make it to the end.

213
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
I'm so torn. I'm torn.

214
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
I think the fact that we're so torn

215
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,180
means that there isn't ever going to be a leader.

216
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,180
I want a double cheeseburger with extra cheese,

217
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,180
extra gherkins, onions, a little bit of lettuce, tomato,

218
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
just for good measure.

219
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
It's the final week on the island.

220
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Food is scarce and the women are starving.

221
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Age. Don't talk about food.

222
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
What's the new rule we say?

223
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,180
Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis.

224
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,180
Just say that instead. It'll stop you thinking about it.

225
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,180
That's why I'm down today. I'm craving food.

226
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Penis.

227
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
We're in a really shit situation

228
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
and there has to be someone that's ballsy enough

229
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
to grab the ball by the horns and go,

230
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
do you know what, guys, this is what we need to do.

231
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
MUSIC PLAYS

232
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
A violent storm is pummeling the island.

233
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Is Jamie still out there?

234
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Yeah, she's having some time now.

235
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Most of the women are sheltering under the fire canopy,

236
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,180
but one of them has removed herself from the group.

237
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Jamie's still toughing it out on the beach.

238
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:07,180
MUSIC CONTINUES

239
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Soaping wet knickers. Isn't that the definition of sexy?

240
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
MUSIC CONTINUES

241
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,180
It's been a broken night's sleep, lying on the wet ground.

242
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm like a fucking elephant, man.

243
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,180
It's really not that bad.

244
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,180
The rain has brought her back to the beach,

245
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,180
but she's not feeling too well.

246
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,180
The rain has brought an onslaught of insect attacks.

247
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I do not want to be on camera today.

248
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,180
If anybody films me, I'll kick off.

249
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,180
The insect bites are driving me round the fucking bend.

250
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
I'd like to punch each fly in the nose.

251
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,180
We had something to fuck off biting us last night

252
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
and I had bites all over my arse.

253
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Bloody ridiculous.

254
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,180
Basically get rid of all this shit on the roof.

255
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,180
Painful, itchy bites aren't their only problem.

256
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180
I mean, there literally is a twig holding that fucking lot up.

257
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,180
The storm has wreaked havoc in camp.

258
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
That don't look good, honey.

259
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
The desperate hunt for food has to be put on hold

260
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,180
as the canopy protecting the fire is on the verge of collapse.

261
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,180
Is that big crack there running along the middle of it? Yeah.

262
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
How are you getting on? Slow.

263
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
But it's better than what we've got, right?

264
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Which is zero right now.

265
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
To shield them from insects and rain,

266
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Jamie and Georgie have decided to build a raised bed with a roof.

267
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
It's a very busy camp today

268
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,180
to make sure we have a good shelter for us.

269
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
And our fire is as dry as a boat.

270
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
All hands on deck.

271
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
Down, down, down, down, down, down, there.

272
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
That's it, you got it.

273
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,180
Shall I go that end and push? Yeah.

274
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Where's everybody gone?

275
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
I think Harvey and...

276
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Me and Jamie are having a lie down.

277
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
It's just got too serious.

278
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
And I know we've got jobs to do,

279
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
but why is there so much pressure all of a sudden?

280
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Guys, we haven't finished!

281
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,180
I know, I know we're not finished.

282
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,180
I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.

283
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,180
Ah! So give me a break, please.

284
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying you haven't finished.

285
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
That's all. Right.

286
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Just whack them all on now.

287
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,180
Oh, God.

288
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
I think I might go on strike tomorrow.

294
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Let's get this roof on, guys, and then we can have a proper tidy.

295
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm going to kill myself with these fucking rockets.

296
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,180
While the rest of the group toil away on the bed shelter...

297
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
..Jamie and Belinda decide to take the afternoon off.

298
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,180
I kind of feel a little bit like, you know when someone comes into your house

299
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:58,180
and takes a massive shit in your toilet, eats all your food, messes your house,

300
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
and then leaves and goes, ''Bye now!''

301
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,180
We have been upset and tired and angry,

302
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,180
and so there's only so long that those things can go on for

303
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
until you have to do something.

304
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
So we have to change it.

305
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
If we're not happy, then do something about it.

306
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Beth and Lauren take decisive action.

307
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
They call an election.

308
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
Jamie!

309
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Hi.

310
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
Hi, love.

311
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
We're having a meeting.

312
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Clothes are optional.

313
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,180
I find Jamie so unpredictable.

314
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,180
I don't know if she's going to shrug it off and just say, ''Oh, do you know what, whatever,''

315
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
or if she's going to kick off about it.

316
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
All the great expeditions have always had a leader,

317
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,180
whether it's Amazon, Scott or Shackleton,

318
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,180
but resistance to leadership is not uncommon.

319
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,180
We've called this meeting today...

320
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,180
..because not much has changed

321
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,180
and most people still want a leader.

322
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,180
If anybody would like to go for leadership,

323
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,180
please make yourself be known.

324
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Me and Beth.

325
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
I'm confused, to be honest.

326
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,180
What's so bad?

327
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,180
We need a leader so everyone knows exactly what they're doing.

328
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
You know my feelings on the leadership.

329
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Not happy with it.

330
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
Our whole experience has been amazing

331
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,180
and so I just want to end on success

332
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
and it means a lot, I think, to show that we never gave up.

333
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
I so get you.

335
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,180
I so want Bear to come and look at our camp and think,

336
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
''Crikey, those girls were good.''

337
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Do we need to take a vote?

338
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
I think we should just go forwards with it

339
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,180
because you're the only people who want to do it.

340
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,180
You're happy to go with Beth and Lauren?

341
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Are people happy with that?

342
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Jamie?

343
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Yeah.

344
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,180
Lauren and Beth are going to run the leadership jointly.

345
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
After all of that, well done.

346
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Thank you.

347
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Be proud of yourselves.

348
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Yeah.

349
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,180
I was so nervous leading up to it.

350
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
I was just thinking, ''Oh, my God, how's this going to be taken?''

351
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Especially after the other day.

352
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,180
But, actually, it seemed pretty positive.

353
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
We need to just straighten out this end.

354
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,180
The new leader's first priority is to feed everyone.

355
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
We are now going to move the nets, basically,

356
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
at a different angle in the sea.

357
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
So, hopefully, we can get a fish.

358
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Yeah.

359
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
We can get a fish.

360
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Together, the women have untangled the vital fishing net.

361
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
OK. Keep it up.

362
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
They're now determined to finally land a big catch.

363
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
I think the net is great.

364
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
I think at least we're trying.

365
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I think God loves to try it.

366
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I think that Jamie is just feeling undervalued,

367
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
that sort of thing.

368
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
With all ten women needed to tackle a food crisis,

369
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Lauren has to bring Jamie back into the fold.

370
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
We need every single one of those girls in the group

371
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
to get through this.

372
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,180
I know what it feels like to fail

373
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
at something that you give your all to,

374
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,180
and I'm not prepared to go through that again.

375
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,180
I probably picture myself as a bit of a young leader.

376
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
In 2013, I decided to row across the Atlantic.

377
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,180
But the boat capsized, I split my head open.

378
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,180
The failure of the row just left a huge void in me.

379
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
And then I thought, yep,

380
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
the island is definitely something I want to do.

381
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
This is definitely how I'm going to get it back.

382
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,180
I always give my everything to whatever challenge I set myself.

383
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,180
So when I fail, I feel...

384
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
I feel that in a big way.

385
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Jay? Jamie?

386
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
So, I just want to clear the air.

387
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,180
I was feeling like you weren't helping out,

388
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,180
but what I should have done, absolutely what I should have done,

389
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
is come and talk to you about it.

390
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,180
I remember I woke up with them bites all over my face,

391
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,180
and that put me in a sort of vicious cycle

392
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,180
where I was, like, just not enjoying being here

393
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,180
and not motivated to do anything.

394
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Get more involved. If you want to do stuff, like...

395
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,180
I do sometimes feel like I can't be arsed.

396
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
SHE LAUGHS

397
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Oh, no!

398
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
I...

400
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
..probably come across selfish,

401
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
but I hope that they can...

402
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,180
..understand that I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...

403
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,180
..I don't want to leave, you know, this island

404
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
feeling sour and bitter.

405
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,180
So, I think we're here. Yeah.

406
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,180
So, this is our beach.

407
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Lauren's plan now is to search for food

408
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
beyond the confines of their beach.

409
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,180
We go up that track until we hit that middle path. Correct.

410
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Then we go down with the sea.

411
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Always on our left-hand side.

412
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,180
She leads a hunting party deep into the jungle.

413
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
See you later.

414
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Along the coast...

415
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
SHE SCREAMS

416
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Oh! My nail got stuck in this fucking gooey bat!

417
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,180
..vegetarian Jamie has volunteered to scavenge for limpets

418
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
to feed the rest of the group.

419
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Oh, my God. Honestly, what is that?

420
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Oh!

421
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,180
SHE SCREAMS

422
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Anything?

423
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
Does that look rotten to you?

424
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Yeah, yeah, an animal's been at it.

425
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,180
We've got snails the size of your head.

426
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Woo-hoo! Shut the front door.

427
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Wow!

428
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
The women on the other side of the island

429
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,180
are still on the hunt for yucca.

430
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,180
It would really suck to have come all of this way

431
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
and not find yucca.

432
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Guys, I've just found a tin of something.

433
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Whoa!

434
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
It might be a tin of peaches.

435
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
Oh, my God.

436
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Thanks, baby.

437
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
SHE SCREAMS

438
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Oh, my God!

439
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
That's going to make everyone super happy.

440
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
Yeah.

441
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,180
Guys!

442
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,180
Chloe!

443
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,180
We found two tins of baked beans!

444
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
You found beans?

445
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
SHE SCREAMS

446
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,180
The rusty tins are packed with protein and sugar

447
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,180
and may have been left by a hunting party from another island.

448
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
It's a lucky find.

449
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Tonight, my dear, we have got a baked bean.

450
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
I can't wait.

451
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
I can't wait to eat it.

452
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Oh!

453
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
What is in the tin?

454
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Oh, wow!

455
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
It couldn't be better news for Jamie,

456
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,180
who survived on nothing but coconuts for weeks.

457
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Fucking hell.

458
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Oh, my God!

459
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Is that not the nicest baked bean you've ever had in your life?

460
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Beans!

461
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,180
You've actually turned the day around completely.

462
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,180
Thank you very much, Jamie.

463
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
Yeah, that was really sweet.

464
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,180
I've never been so excited about baked beans in all my life.

465
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Oh, my God, this is amazing! This is amazing!

466
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Oh, my God, what are we doing passing it round?

467
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,180
I can't even begin to tell you how good they are.

468
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Oh, my God!

469
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Sweet, yummy.

470
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Tasty, tasty. Protein.

471
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Thank you so much, girls.

472
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
From today onwards,

473
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,180
we're going to try and think about what needs to be done

474
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,180
to get the whole group to kind of work as one machine

475
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,180
to a point where we do have enough food.

476
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,180
It's Jamie's first belly-filling meal on the island.

477
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Come on!

478
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
It's been six weeks!

479
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
No, it's been longer than that.

480
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Oh, do you know what? Do you want to hear a funny story?

481
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Oh, my God, this is hilarious.

482
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,180
As a dental technician, you know, like, the mould that you take of the teeth?

483
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Well, you can use that stuff for also taking an impression of your cock.

484
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
That ex-boyfriend came round for dinner.

485
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
It was going on and on and on.

486
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I want you to do my willy, I want you to do my...

487
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Honestly, I've still got it to this day,

488
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,180
this big stone plaster cast of a willy.

489
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Wow!

490
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,180
And it's like a lethal weapon, it weighs a tonne.

491
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
LAUGHTER

492
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,180
I personally have struggled.

493
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Jesus, I have struggled.

494
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
But you know what?

495
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,180
To everyone that thought I wasn't going to survive...

496
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
..I'm here still.

497
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
Hiya!

498
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
6am.

499
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,180
We are on our way to catch some fishes.

500
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Leaders Lauren and Jamie

501
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
and Lauren and Beth decide the time has come

502
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,180
for an all-out assault to conquer the island.

503
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,180
For the survivor, determination is a critical one

504
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,180
and I love that Winston Churchill quote that sums it up.

505
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,180
It just says, never, ever, ever quit.

506
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Oh, that is beautiful.

507
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,180
So far, a big fish haul has eluded them.

508
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,180
The women are now praying their plan to reposition the net

509
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
has been successful.

510
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,180
I would give anything for there to be fish in this net now.

511
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
I'm scared, I don't want to look.

512
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm in fear of disappointment.

513
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
Oh, what was that?

514
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
What have we got? What have we got?

515
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,180
So far, we've got two catfish, one other fish, two stingrays.

516
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Yes!

517
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
LAUGHTER

518
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
Yes!

519
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I'm so happy.

520
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
I'm so happy.

521
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Give me!

522
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Yes!

523
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,180
She'll have a fishy on a little dishy

524
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
She'll have a fishy...

525
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Another stingray! Two!

526
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Awesome work, awesome work.

527
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
So happy, it makes you so happy,

528
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
like, to know that you're going to eat.

529
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
That worry's not there now.

530
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
But it's sort of proved

531
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,180
that our survival skills aren't that bad

532
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
and we can make it work.

533
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Yeah.

534
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
I do miss toilet seats.

535
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Yeah, I can't wait to have a poo in the toilet.

536
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Three days left on the island.

537
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Guys, what's the plan for today?

538
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,180
We need two people to do water collection, ASAP.

539
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
I don't mind doing it again.

540
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,180
We just need to get shitloads of wood.

541
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Then we're going to get on to cleaning this area,

542
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
cos it's gross.

543
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Top plan, I love a plan.

544
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Five minutes.

545
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,180
Lauren's new daily rota is galvanising the women.

546
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Lauren, what are we doing?

547
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Sweeping away the leaves.

548
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,180
Cos we're girls and we like a clean floor.

549
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
I'm going to put this over your head.

550
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Oh, my God!

551
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Get the camera down!

552
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Oh, my God!

553
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,180
We've started to line the entrance with coconuts.

554
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Now what we need is some candles.

555
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

556
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Oh, wouldn't that be dreamy?

557
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Seashell bunting.

558
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
It's absolutely beautiful.

559
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
I love making stuff.

560
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
That'll cost a fortune back home.

561
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,180
These guys can come together, they can look after each other,

562
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,180
they can build community,

563
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,180
they can find that kind of something inside that drives them on,

564
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
that positive stuff.

565
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
But also, ultimately, they're not just surviving,

566
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
they're now learning to thrive.

567
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
And that's when you kind of see the magic.

568
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,180
We've got enough food now, we've got enough water,

569
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,180
we've kept the fire going, and so our priority now is shelter.

570
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Oh, here's a big bastard.

571
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
A big jobby.

572
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Until that boat rocks up on this shore,

573
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,180
we're going to be tidying up, organising,

574
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,180
so it's about pride,

575
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
and it's wanting to show to the world

576
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,180
that what the majority of females are made of

577
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
and what we're capable of doing with nothing.

578
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
Oh, my God!

579
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
It's like a tent, isn't it?

580
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Ooh!

581
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Oh-ho!

582
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Ooh!

583
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Oh, God, it's nice, you know. It's a bit noisy.

584
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Yeah, but... Oh, God, but it's comfortable.

585
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Oh, it's lovely.

586
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,180
That is mega-wow!

587
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,180
I could rest my bones here for a while, me thinks.

588
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
And teamwork.

589
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,180
It's nice that we've all built something together, you know?

590
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
And I think it's amazing and awesome.

591
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Carnival!

592
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
We'll take it to Rio.

593
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,180
Beth and Lauren's vision for how the island should run began.

594
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Jesus, how much better is it?

595
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
I cannot begin to tell you.

596
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,180
Babes, come outside, I've got a present for you.

597
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
OK, close your eyes.

598
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
What is it?

599
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Ready?

600
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
You fucking bitch!

601
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,180
I knew it was something like that!

602
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
I know you, you little bitch.

603
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
Relationships are renewed.

604
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
The camp is now secure and comfortable,

605
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
and finally there's food on the table.

606
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
This is our first lunch.

607
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
Now we've worked it out,

608
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,180
and I really think we have worked out how to do it.

609
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
Yay!

610
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
We've survived.

611
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,180
And most of all, now we are thriving.

612
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Is the tide coming in or going out?

613
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Coming in.

614
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Becky, Lauren and Beth brave the morning tide

615
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
to fetch water for the camp.

616
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
We made it!

617
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,180
Whoo!

618
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
As they head back, Lauren and Beth

619
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
make a discovery.

620
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Becky!

621
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Oh, look what we found here!

622
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
Oh!

623
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Oh, hi there!

624
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Come and join me, ladies.

625
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Yay!

626
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Lauren plans to use a washed-up polystyrene block

627
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,180
as a raft to make the exhausting daily water run

628
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,180
easier and quicker.

629
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Are you kidding me?

630
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
What?

631
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
The Vader raft?

632
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
That is amazing!

633
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Whoo!

634
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,180
I never, ever thought it was going to be

635
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
as hard as it has been.

636
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,180
If I can complete this, then I know within myself

637
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,180
that I didn't fail at rowing across the Atlantic.

638
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
And I need that.

639
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
I need that closure.

640
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,180
I need that feeling that I am strong enough

641
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
within myself to finish something.

642
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
We come with water.

643
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
This hand is next to the navy.

644
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Bear grouse can bugger off.

645
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
We've got Lauren.

646
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
We're fine.

647
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
I'm coming!

648
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
With the fight for survival mastered,

649
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,180
they can now embrace the island's delights.

650
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Great swim!

651
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
I think in both survival and in life,

652
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
you know, good things and worthwhile things

653
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
don't always come easy.

654
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,180
And for those that can endure on the island,

655
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
there will come a time when they will be able

656
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
to make the most of it.

657
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
And I think that's what we're going to do.

658
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
I'm sure on the island there will come a sense of pride

659
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
that money really can't buy, you know,

660
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
and it's a pride that will have been hard earned

661
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,180
through heart, through grit and through endeavour.

662
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
What are we up to?

663
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,180
We're going to check the net and...

664
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Crab hunting!

665
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Woo-hoo!

666
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
So excited!

667
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
As their days on the island draw to a close,

668
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,180
the women are seizing every opportunity to get food.

669
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

670
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Oh!

671
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Julie's got a big one!

672
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Right, got him!

673
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Give us that bucket!

674
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Yeah, go on, get him in, yeah!

675
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
In, in, in!

676
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Woo!

677
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
You got another one?

678
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Yeah!

679
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
Oh!

680
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Julie!

681
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Don't let him into your bucket!

682
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,180
He's in, he's in, he's in.

683
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Great, great.

684
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
He's a fucking monster, that one.

685
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Yeah.

686
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Julie, you've turned into an absolute animal.

687
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Get in there.

688
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
Oh, my God.

689
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
What's happened to me?

690
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,180
I was a lady in the pool.

691
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
To follow the crab starter,

692
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,180
they're hoping to catch a main course in their fishing net.

693
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,180
This one's very...wrunkled.

694
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Have a quick look.

695
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
There's the butter.

696
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
There's a fish, there's a fish!

697
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,180
No.

698
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Got a big one!

700
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Wow!

701
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Fuck me, what is it?

702
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
What is it?

703
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
It's huge!

704
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,180
It's a shark!

705
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
A shark!

706
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
He's still alive!

707
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
I need something to hit him with.

708
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
I need a big piece of wood.

709
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
OK, OK, I'll get it.

710
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
There's a bit of wood.

711
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,180
I've got it.

712
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
I've got it.

713
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
Ready?

714
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
I've got it.

715
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I've got it.

716
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
I've got it.

717
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I've got it.

718
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
I've got it.

719
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
I've got it.

720
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I've got it.

721
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
I've got it.

722
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
I've got it.

723
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I've got it.

724
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
I've got it.

725
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
I've got it.

726
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
I've got it.

727
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
I've got it.

728
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Ok, good job, guys.

729
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
I hope everyone's hungry!

730
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Right, come on, ladies.

731
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
Soapies!

732
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Fish for breakfast, Fish for supper.

733
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Nailing it!

734
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,260
Here, take this one.

735
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,180
That's delicious.

736
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,520
Foo Corn!

737
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,080
Look at the colour!

738
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Foo Corn!

739
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,180
Thank you, all.

740
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Foo Corn!

741
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,080
Thank you, all!

742
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Foo Corn!

743
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Foo Corn!

744
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Right, I am.

745
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Foo Corn!

746
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Foo Corn!

747
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Foo Corn!

748
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is Bravo, Emma.

749
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
This is Foxtrot.

750
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I have for some news for you, ladies.

751
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,080
Tomorrow, a man called Bear will be coming to your island.

752
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
You are coming home.

753
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

754
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

755
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Yay!

756
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Wow!

757
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,080
We've got on the island and we've actually done it.

758
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Well done. Well done.

759
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
It's mad. I feel numb and I feel fear.

760
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,080
You know when you've had, like, a near miss in the car or something...

761
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Yeah. ..and you go like...

762
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
..like that, and then it hits and you go a bit numb

763
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,080
and you have to pull over cos you're a bit shaky? Yeah.

764
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
I feel like I've just been nearly hit.

765
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
It's a women's final night on the island.

766
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,080
OK, so we need to find some sort of cup. Do we have a sort of cup?

767
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
And there's much to celebrate.

768
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Yeah.

769
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Oh!

770
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I got my ticket for the long way round

771
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Two bottle whiskies by the way

772
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,080
And I sugar like some sweet company

773
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,080
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?

774
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,080
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

775
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

776
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
You're gonna miss me by my hair

777
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
You're gonna miss me everywhere

778
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Oh, you're still gonna miss me

779
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
When I'm gone

780
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Life is either a great adventure or nothing.

781
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
As fast as we can!

782
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,080
We're a group of completely ordinary, down-to-earth women.

783
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh!

784
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
You fucking snake, it came towards me!

785
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
It came right at me!

786
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
With no survival experience.

787
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Fuck.

788
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Oh my god, there's a caiman.

789
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
That is a big fucker.

790
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,080
We faced adversity every step of the way.

791
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,080
We cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost.

792
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
But we kept fighting.

793
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Get the knife, get the knife!

794
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
You are not leaving this island till the fucking end game, right?

795
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
We were wet, cold and starving.

796
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,080
I just need to get some food. Just something.

797
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Yet we found the strength

798
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
to keep pushing on.

799
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Look at that little fire.

800
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Fucking giant one!

801
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Look at this!

802
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
If we hadn't have kept going,

803
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
it would have been the end.

804
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
In time, those memories will fade.

805
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
But what we will remember

806
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
are the women we experienced it with,

807
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
the friendships,

808
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
and how they made us feel.

809
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Yeah!

810
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
We're winning.

811
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Tomorrow, the women finally go home.

812
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
It's really weird.

813
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,080
We all feel so comfortable, in a way, with each other.

814
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Sort of like a family.

815
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
I want to go home, but I don't want to leave.

816
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
I know.

817
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
I know what you mean.

818
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Is that a boat? That's his boat.

819
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Oh, my god.

820
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
We've never done this before.

821
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
14 women left on their own with nothing

822
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
in some of the harshest environments on the planet.

823
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
You know, they really are just ordinary people

824
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
from all walks of life.

825
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Whoo!

826
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
And it hasn't just pushed them to the limits.

827
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,080
To be honest, it will have pushed them beyond that.

828
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
And what speaks volumes is that they're still there.

829
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Whoo!

830
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Yes!

831
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Ten very grateful women.

832
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Oh, god.

833
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Oh, my god, it's actually happening.

834
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
It's actually happening.

835
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
This is amazing.

836
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Whoo!

837
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Whoo!

838
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Whoo!

839
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Whoo!

840
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Whoo!

841
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Whoo!

842
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
Whoo!

843
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Whoo!

844
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Whoo!

845
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Wow.

846
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Hi.

847
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Hi.

848
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Welcome.

849
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Wow.

850
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Look at you.

851
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Look at you guys.

852
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
This is how best it is.

853
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Genuinely, what you've been through, respect.

854
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Thank you.

855
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:09,080
You now understand this stuff is tough, you know?

856
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Thank you.

857
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Well done, you.

858
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Well done, you.

859
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Well, welcome.

860
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Wow, look at this. This is cool.

861
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
It's very cool. Here's our art installation.

862
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
And it's so clean.

863
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
I love this.

864
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
That's Harvey.

865
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Thank you.

866
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
It's the little touches.

867
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
We've got a bed made of bottles

868
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
and a separate area for sitting and lounging around

869
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
and, you know, just generally hanging out.

870
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
This is so smart. It's getting you off the ground,

871
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
but it's communal.

872
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Let's face it, girls, we like spoons, don't we?

873
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
We love a spoon. We love a spoon.

874
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
We've met the stereotype

875
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,080
with our decorations and our little feminine touches,

876
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
but totally blown it away

877
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,080
by the strength and the stamina

878
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,080
and the guts and the determination.

879
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,080
These women have got balls,

880
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
and big balls at last.

881
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
I would agree with that.

882
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
You ready to get the hell off this island?

883
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

884
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Dude! Dude!

885
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

886
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
If I hadn't turned up today,

887
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
and I turn up in six months,

888
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
I bet these guys would be in pretty good shape.

889
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Oh, don't be mean to me.

890
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Don't be mean to me.

891
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
And I knew it.

892
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I knew the stereotype was wrong, you know?

893
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
But I knew they could nail this.

894
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,080
And for me, I'm so genuinely proud

895
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
of what they have achieved.

896
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
And they should be. And they are.

897
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

898
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Woo!

899
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Thank you.

900
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

901
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Oh, my God!

902
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Oh, my God!

903
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Oh, my God!

904
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

905
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm so proud of all of us that we've achieved this.

906
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,080
We have shown the world that women can achieve anything.

907
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
What I've learned is I need to appreciate

908
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
what I've got right now

909
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,080
and not strive to look for other better things.

910
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
I think it's made me more confident.

911
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I've gained.

912
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I've decided that I'm OK.

913
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
I'm not such a bad person.

914
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
I'm a good skin.

915
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,080
But being here, I felt so alive.

916
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
And I thought, God, this is me.

917
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
I feel happy.

918
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,080
And so, yeah, for me, I feel like this is it.

919
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,080
This is where I get something out of life.

920
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
And I want to run with it.

921
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
But I've survived for nearly two months,

922
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
and we've done it.

923
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
I can do any shit that I want.

924
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
And so can anybody else.

925
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
And it's brilliant.

926
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,080
We're amazing.

927
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Woo!

928
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,080
We're nearly there!

929
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Yes!

930
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.

931
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Yeah!

932
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Oh!

933
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Oh!

934
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Oh!

935
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Oh!

936
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Oh!

937
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm so glad I made it.

938
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
I can't believe I made it.

939
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
I'm getting emotional over that.

940
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
I've just been that brave.

941
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
I've been really brave.

942
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,080
Oh, for me.

943
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,080
The women have had no contact with the outside world

944
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,080
and loved ones for six weeks.

945
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Hi, Mum.

946
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Are you OK?

947
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Are you OK?

948
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah, it was amazing.

949
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,080
It was really fucking hard as well.

950
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
Hello?

951
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Hello?

952
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, my God!

953
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
Baby!

954
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
We can't wait to see you.

955
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,080
Yeah.

956
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
I've loved...

957
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I've missed you all as well more than I ever imagined.

958
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Hello, Daddy.

959
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
I've missed you so much.

960
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
Oh, God.

961
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
It's, like, sensational.

962
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Oh.

963
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
Oh, my God.

964
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
Having been stripped of any luxuries,

965
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
they're finally reintroduced to the modern world.

966
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Oh, my God.

967
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
How nice does that feel?

968
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
What's this?

969
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,080
Ooh!

970
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
Oh!

971
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
What's it like?

972
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,080
Oh, look at my hair.

973
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Amazing.

974
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
The way it cuts your bottom.

975
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,080
What the hell?

976
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
My eyebrows!

977
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
God, it's so clear.

978
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Oh, my God.

979
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Oh, my God.

980
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Oh, my God.

981
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Oh, my God.

982
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Oh, my God.

983
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Oh, my God.

984
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Oh, my God.

985
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Oh, my God.

986
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Oh, my God.

987
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
Oh, my God.

988
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Oh, my God.

989
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Oh, my God.

990
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
Oh, my God.

991
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Oh, my God.

992
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Oh, my God.

993
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Oh, my God.

994
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
Oh, my God.

995
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
Oh, my God.

996
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Oh, my God.

997
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Oh, my God.

998
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
Oh, my God.

999
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
Oh, my God.

1000
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
It's so clean.

1001
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
I love clean, being clean, you know.

1002
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
This is amazing!

1003
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
The women's bodies are in a fragile state,

1004
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,060
and for the first three days, they must stick to a simple diet.

1005
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,060
No!

1006
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,060
That drinks.

1007
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,060
Yay!

1008
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
That is great.

1009
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,060
Thank you very much.

1010
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Is this chicken?

1011
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Oh!

1012
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,060
Yes, it is.

1013
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,060
Even the smell of the rice.

1014
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,060
It's so good.

1015
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,060
Oh, my God.

1016
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,060
I mean, it's so good.

1017
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,060
It's so good.

1018
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
This is good.

1019
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,060
It's our first meal off the island, girls.

1020
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,660
Cheers!

1021
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,540
Cheers!

1022
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,820
This experiment ultimately shows that, really, it isn't about gender.

1023
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,500
It's about attitude.

1024
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,060
Some people have that heart and mind of a survivor.

1025
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,340
Determined, team players,

1026
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,180
hard-working, resourceful.

1027
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,500
What these ordinary women have been through genuinely is remarkable.

1028
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,860
They've endured unbelievable hardships

1029
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,940
and they've come out of it empowered and positive.

1030
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,020
And for that, they've won my respect.

1031
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,100
Big time.

1032
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,060
It's like the best company ever, isn't it?

1033
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,340
Hello!

1034
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,180
You can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.

1035
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,420
Please, walk!

1036
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Walk!

1037
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,300
Next time, it's the final instalment of the men's island.

1038
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,260
I'm going to go to hell for this.

1039
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1040
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,940
I'm a scorpion.

1041
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,820
People are just starting not to give a shit anymore.

1042
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,620
Come on, boys!

1043
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,620
Son!

1044
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,740
Mother Nature and this island will bite you whenever she feels fit.

1045
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,180
It only starts on the first week of the trip.

1046
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
Suzanne, stay here!

1047
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,300
I'll meet you in my cell.

1048
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Hey, Dan!

1049
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,060
Thar...

1050
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,500
Humph!

1051
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,100
It's a poder safety method,

1052
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,220
I'd say it's about time.

1053
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,220
Not yet.

1054
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,620
The options are like that.

1055
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,300
You dirty seagulls.

1056
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,620
It'd be happiness for me to know

1057
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,980
what exactly those seagulls think about that labor.

1058
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,540
Some get by time to get the farm going.

1059
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,660
If you are going to do it,

1060
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,700
start in the headaches.

1061
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,940
If you continue to work with a double,

1062
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,020
not an founders' job.

1063
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,900
You deal with it.
