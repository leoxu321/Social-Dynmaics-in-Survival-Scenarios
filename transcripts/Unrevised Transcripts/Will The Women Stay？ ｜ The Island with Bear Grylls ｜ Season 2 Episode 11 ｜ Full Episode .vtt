WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.640 --> 00:22.920
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

00:22.920 --> 00:29.560
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in fishing equipment and a handful of

00:29.560 --> 00:38.920
basic tools filming everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it

00:38.920 --> 00:49.540
be brute power or mental strength the winds a day daddy brought home the Baker who will have

00:49.540 --> 00:58.080
what it takes to stay alive tonight is the final installment of the women's I don't want to be on

00:58.080 --> 00:59.540
camera today anybody

00:59.540 --> 01:09.380
survival will be harder than ever the search for food is now a matter of life and death

01:09.380 --> 01:14.660
it's a joke living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season

01:16.660 --> 01:26.060
I think we are on our last leg when pitted against the extremes of nature with the finishing line in

01:26.060 --> 01:29.540
sight these Monday women are

01:29.540 --> 01:36.540
they just sleeping on a bit of ice an april 18th it's just a cold slide you've got to find

01:36.540 --> 01:42.380
the hot potato first've got what it takes to survive I'll do what I'm wanting to do

01:42.380 --> 01:50.120
I understand and go I'm not going to do it let me finish as usual arguments of the staff seeds

01:51.540 --> 01:55.660
why cant you fucking know here and the baby fucking soon

01:56.500 --> 01:59.400
After nearly five weeks of heat followed by a haberdam program which was a result of the

01:59.400 --> 02:06.540
on the island the ten remaining women were on the verge of failure they were

02:06.540 --> 02:12.420
dangerously dehydrated and had an urgent medical warning all the plug on this

02:12.420 --> 02:17.220
that their lives were at risk in scary territory where we just don't know

02:17.220 --> 02:23.440
what's happening to our bodies but they pulled themselves back from the brink

02:23.440 --> 02:32.800
now entering their sixth week surviving on the island food in the camp vicinity

02:32.800 --> 02:37.680
is running out the starving women face a battle to make it to the end

02:37.680 --> 02:49.540
desperate for something to eat

02:49.540 --> 02:53.080
Becky

02:53.080 --> 02:53.420
Julie

02:53.420 --> 03:00.420
and Georgie brave the vicious incoming tide to scavenge the last remaining oysters.

03:23.420 --> 03:39.620
Oh, bloody hell. Today I'm feeling like absolute shit. I know that I keep saying I feel like

03:39.620 --> 03:48.620
shit, but today I feel like dried white dog poo shit.

03:48.620 --> 03:53.400
Since they've arrived on the island, the starving women have shed more than 140 pounds.

03:53.400 --> 03:58.400
between them. The weight of an average woman.

03:58.400 --> 04:04.160
Our coconut supply is running low. Our yucca around here is non-existent. The limes have

04:04.160 --> 04:09.960
now gone. The almond fruits that grow on the trees here, we've eaten all of those.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.080
Oh, they stink.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.300
For six weeks, vegetarian Jamie has been surviving on nothing but nuts and coconuts.

04:17.300 --> 04:23.300
As soon as I get off here, I need to get as much protein in me as I can.

04:23.300 --> 04:23.380
Yeah.

04:23.380 --> 04:31.480
I just had a day, but you'll get a big fat sausage in you as soon as you get off here.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.480
Sometimes I do eat meat, but only the sausage variety. Sometimes I like a bit of chorizo,

04:37.480 --> 04:41.480
but I don't like them chipolatas.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.940
Here, let me help you.

04:44.940 --> 04:49.480
With food so scarce around camp, the rest of the women are having to rely solely on

04:49.480 --> 04:53.280
the fishing net they've set in the shallows.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
Oh, I think that's something in the net.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
It's a shark.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.280
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
That is unbelievable.

05:00.280 --> 05:07.280
All right, got him. Quick, he's getting away.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.280
No, he's got a way. He's got a way. He's got a way.

05:09.280 --> 05:16.280
Oh, damn. Damn, damn, damn.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.280
No supper for us tonight.

05:18.280 --> 05:23.180
There's 10 of us, and I think we are on our last legs.

05:23.180 --> 05:27.180
I think we are on our last legs.

05:27.180 --> 05:30.180
When Mother Nature slams that larder door firmly shut,

05:30.180 --> 05:33.180
things in a group can rapidly go downhill.

05:33.180 --> 05:36.180
You're hungry, you're despondent, and it's so tempting to give up.

05:36.180 --> 05:39.180
But like so many things in life and in the wild,

05:39.180 --> 05:43.180
it's actually about how you respond to those crisis moments.

05:45.180 --> 05:51.180
I've literally been up almost all night just trying to keep that fire alive.

05:51.180 --> 05:56.180
From day one, the women have governed themselves in a leaderless community,

05:56.180 --> 05:58.180
trying to make group decisions.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.180
What, was there not enough wood? Have we run out of wood now?

06:01.180 --> 06:03.180
We ran out of wood last night, and everyone went to...

06:03.180 --> 06:05.180
You're joking. Yeah.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.180
People just know they need to fucking get wood.

06:07.180 --> 06:10.180
End of story. That's the bit that I don't get.

06:10.180 --> 06:14.180
There's no leader. Not one person rules the roost.

06:14.180 --> 06:19.180
We work collectively, so we have to kind of use our initiative

06:19.180 --> 06:20.180
and work off the average.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.180
So if, say, I want to go foraging,

06:23.180 --> 06:26.180
I don't have to be told to go foraging.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.180
I'm going to go foraging.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.180
All the decisions we've made thus far have been made elaboratively.

06:32.180 --> 06:37.180
We've not needed to conform to a system where there's a leader.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.180
The women need to survive seven more days on the island.

06:44.180 --> 06:48.180
Any hope of dinner depends entirely on catching fish.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.180
The women are yet to be found.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.180
It's time to establish a rota for checking the nets,

06:53.180 --> 06:55.180
and Julie has made a discovery.

06:55.180 --> 06:58.180
The net is in a right mess.

06:58.180 --> 07:02.180
It's just... It's curled over that tight.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.180
There's no teamwork.

07:04.180 --> 07:06.180
There's no organisation.

07:08.180 --> 07:11.180
There's... Nobody wants responsibility for anything.

07:13.180 --> 07:16.180
Holy shit. It's an absolute state.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.180
I mean, have you seen that?

07:18.180 --> 07:21.180
It's crested, it's crested, it's crested.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.180
High, stormy seas have destroyed their last hope

07:24.180 --> 07:26.180
of getting something to eat.

07:26.180 --> 07:30.180
Fishing is the only thing that we survive off at the minute.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.180
We need to get it sorted ASAP.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.180
It's just getting more and more tangled.

07:36.180 --> 07:39.180
Yeah, I know, but just pulling it like that's going to rip it, isn't it?

07:39.180 --> 07:40.180
No, it's not.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.180
Well, it is when... I can feel it.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.180
Well...

07:44.180 --> 07:46.180
I'll just wait until we've used it.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.180
Stop being a stroppy cow, Jamie. What's up with you?

07:50.180 --> 07:52.180
Where's Jamie gone?

07:52.180 --> 07:55.180
Fucking want to get fucking off here.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.180
It better be fucking soon.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.180
I would say I've had a hard life growing up.

08:03.180 --> 08:07.180
My mum's got MS and she's been in a care home.

08:07.180 --> 08:11.180
She's always said to me to basically live life to the full

08:11.180 --> 08:14.180
because she's never been able to do the things that I've done.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.180
It's made me...

08:15.180 --> 08:18.180
It's made me extremely independent.

08:18.180 --> 08:21.180
So if someone was to start bossing me about,

08:21.180 --> 08:26.180
it would make me really upset and probably make me really angry.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.180
I'll do what I want, when I want.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.180
I don't want anybody telling me what to do, bossing me about.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.180
Fed up.

08:35.180 --> 08:38.180
We have to do things that, you know, we don't always want to do,

08:38.180 --> 08:40.180
but it's for the team.

08:40.180 --> 08:43.180
I've had enough of fucking everything!

08:45.180 --> 08:47.180
It really is shit!

08:50.180 --> 08:53.180
If anything's going to make me leave this island,

08:53.180 --> 08:55.180
it's the people.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.180
It's not like a team work.

08:59.180 --> 09:02.180
Well, darling, I mean, I don't know what to say to you other than,

09:02.180 --> 09:04.180
you know, I completely agree.

09:04.180 --> 09:07.180
I thought we were all going to be a team and pull together and...

09:09.180 --> 09:11.180
It's not like that at all, is it?

09:11.180 --> 09:13.180
It's absolutely not like that at all.

09:14.180 --> 09:18.180
The effects of starvation on the body are not just physical.

09:18.180 --> 09:22.180
Extreme hunger makes people desperate, depressed, irritable,

09:22.180 --> 09:25.180
and all the negative emotions that women are experiencing

09:25.180 --> 09:27.180
will be amplified.

09:27.180 --> 09:30.180
And if there are rifts emerging now, what hunger will do,

09:30.180 --> 09:34.180
it will act like a crowbar, forcing those rifts further apart.

09:43.180 --> 09:47.180
So, what's everybody doing? Can we just make it clear?

09:48.180 --> 09:51.180
Nobody's taken responsibility to set a fire rotor,

09:51.180 --> 09:56.180
so it's left to Beth and Lauren again to keep the embers going through the night.

09:56.180 --> 10:00.180
I'm sorting out the fire. You're sorting out your socks.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.180
While Jamie has slept.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.180
I think you should help.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.180
Right, well, do you know what I can't be doing with this?

10:07.180 --> 10:09.180
Literally, you've got to bend over and get a fucking twig.

10:09.180 --> 10:12.180
Well, just stop fucking bossing me about, right?

10:12.180 --> 10:14.180
Look, there's Rose here.

10:14.180 --> 10:18.180
I want to show my daughter that I can be brave.

10:18.180 --> 10:22.180
I want to show her that there are endless possibilities

10:22.180 --> 10:24.180
and a woman can do anything.

10:24.180 --> 10:28.180
I'm hoping we're all going to group together and be a team,

10:28.180 --> 10:30.180
especially because it's just a group of women.

10:30.180 --> 10:33.180
I think we've all got a little bit of something to prove.

10:35.180 --> 10:36.180
I will help when I'm ready.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.180
I've been up all night with the frigging fire.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.180
And I'm tired too.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.180
And you're saying...

10:42.180 --> 10:44.180
You're sitting there sorting out your fucking feet.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.180
I've got socks on.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.180
Whatever.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.180
Fucking laziness. It's outrageous.

10:53.180 --> 10:56.180
It's absolutely outrageous.

10:56.180 --> 11:00.180
We're all a bit fed up with Jamie. There, I've said it.

11:00.180 --> 11:03.180
It's really making me frustrated.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.180
And...

11:05.180 --> 11:07.180
..every time I stop,

11:07.180 --> 11:10.180
I feel like people are looking at me.

11:10.180 --> 11:11.180
Actually, you know,

11:11.180 --> 11:14.180
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...

11:14.180 --> 11:17.180
I don't know, but I think we're going to end up killing each other

11:17.180 --> 11:19.180
by the end of this, I really do.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.180
We are completely dysfunctional as a group.

11:24.180 --> 11:28.180
I find that deeply upsetting and deeply frustrating

11:28.180 --> 11:31.180
that we're led by mush.

11:31.180 --> 11:35.180
We need a leadership to get ourself together,

11:35.180 --> 11:37.180
to get our food sorted,

11:37.180 --> 11:40.180
and we just can't live from this sort of hand-to-mouth,

11:40.180 --> 11:42.180
piecemeal way.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.180
More thought needs to be going into this, for sure.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.180
Lauren and Beth call an emergency meeting.

11:50.180 --> 11:54.180
We're working for democracy and, you know, things are pretty positive.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.180
Something...something has gone wrong somewhere.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.180
What do you think has gone wrong?

11:59.180 --> 12:01.180
We're literally starved.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.180
The group feels fragmented and that we're not a unit.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.180
I don't know how that fire's managed to keep going.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.180
It's literally by luck and coincidence that we keep rocking up,

12:12.180 --> 12:15.180
going, oh, fuck, the fire's literally just about to go out,

12:15.180 --> 12:18.180
and, oh, God, I've just got that jab of water.

12:18.180 --> 12:21.180
You know, it's basically lack of structure

12:21.180 --> 12:24.180
because then we have lack of food and it's kind of a knock-on effect.

12:24.180 --> 12:28.180
I think, personally, we need to decide on a leader

12:28.180 --> 12:32.180
to set out what is needed and a plan of action.

12:32.180 --> 12:36.180
I can hear you're really passionate, Georgie, and I totally get it,

12:36.180 --> 12:38.180
but I think, for me, we collapse.

12:38.180 --> 12:42.180
For me, we collaboratively lead the group.

12:42.180 --> 12:46.180
Harvey, that system is not working because we've done that

12:46.180 --> 12:48.180
and I think we're stumbling from one day to the next

12:48.180 --> 12:50.180
and now we're in crises.

12:50.180 --> 12:53.180
I'm with Harvey here. Why is it necessary to have the leader?

12:53.180 --> 12:55.180
Because the leader knows where everything is.

12:55.180 --> 12:59.180
The leader will lead you and go, right, OK, these are the priorities.

12:59.180 --> 13:05.180
Why should I let somebody boss me about and tell me what to do?

13:05.180 --> 13:07.180
I'll do what I want to do.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.180
You cannot stand there and go, I'm going to do what I want to do

13:10.180 --> 13:13.180
and if someone's telling me what to do, I'm not going to do it.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.180
But we all need to come together.

13:15.180 --> 13:17.180
Exactly, the arguments have started already.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.180
It's not an argument, Jamie.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.180
This is what happens when you try and elect leaders.

13:21.180 --> 13:24.180
SHE GASPS

13:24.180 --> 13:26.180
This is what I didn't want.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.180
I know, I know.

13:28.180 --> 13:31.180
The last few days.

13:31.180 --> 13:34.180
This is what I didn't want.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.180
Trying to improve their destructive group dynamic,

13:37.180 --> 13:39.180
it is important for the women.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.180
Now they've turned on each other,

13:41.180 --> 13:44.180
they've pushed their very survival back into jeopardy

13:44.180 --> 13:48.180
and without decisive leadership, they won't make it to the end.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.180
I'm so torn. I'm torn.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.180
I think the fact that we're so torn

13:52.180 --> 13:55.180
means that there isn't ever going to be a leader.

13:57.180 --> 14:01.180
I want a double cheeseburger with extra cheese,

14:01.180 --> 14:05.180
extra gherkins, onions, a little bit of lettuce, tomato,

14:05.180 --> 14:06.180
just for good measure.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.180
It's the final week on the island.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.180
Food is scarce and the women are starving.

14:11.180 --> 14:14.180
Age. Don't talk about food.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.180
What's the new rule we say?

14:16.180 --> 14:18.180
Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis.

14:18.180 --> 14:21.180
Just say that instead. It'll stop you thinking about it.

14:21.180 --> 14:24.180
That's why I'm down today. I'm craving food.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.180
Penis.

14:26.180 --> 14:28.180
We're in a really shit situation

14:28.180 --> 14:30.180
and there has to be someone that's ballsy enough

14:30.180 --> 14:32.180
to grab the ball by the horns and go,

14:32.180 --> 14:34.180
do you know what, guys, this is what we need to do.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.180
MUSIC PLAYS

14:36.180 --> 14:38.180
A violent storm is pummeling the island.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.180
Is Jamie still out there?

14:46.180 --> 14:49.180
Yeah, she's having some time now.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.180
Most of the women are sheltering under the fire canopy,

14:52.180 --> 14:55.180
but one of them has removed herself from the group.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.180
Jamie's still toughing it out on the beach.

14:57.180 --> 15:07.180
MUSIC CONTINUES

15:07.180 --> 15:11.180
Soaping wet knickers. Isn't that the definition of sexy?

15:11.180 --> 15:13.180
MUSIC CONTINUES

15:13.180 --> 15:17.180
It's been a broken night's sleep, lying on the wet ground.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.180
I'm like a fucking elephant, man.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.180
It's really not that bad.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.180
The rain has brought her back to the beach,

15:23.180 --> 15:25.180
but she's not feeling too well.

15:25.180 --> 15:28.180
The rain has brought an onslaught of insect attacks.

15:28.180 --> 15:31.180
I do not want to be on camera today.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.180
If anybody films me, I'll kick off.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.180
The insect bites are driving me round the fucking bend.

15:37.180 --> 15:39.180
I'd like to punch each fly in the nose.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.180
We had something to fuck off biting us last night

15:42.180 --> 15:44.180
and I had bites all over my arse.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.180
Bloody ridiculous.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.180
Basically get rid of all this shit on the roof.

15:51.180 --> 15:54.180
Painful, itchy bites aren't their only problem.

15:55.180 --> 15:58.180
I mean, there literally is a twig holding that fucking lot up.

15:58.180 --> 16:01.180
The storm has wreaked havoc in camp.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.180
That don't look good, honey.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.180
The desperate hunt for food has to be put on hold

16:06.180 --> 16:10.180
as the canopy protecting the fire is on the verge of collapse.

16:10.180 --> 16:13.180
Is that big crack there running along the middle of it? Yeah.

16:15.180 --> 16:18.180
How are you getting on? Slow.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.180
But it's better than what we've got, right?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.180
Which is zero right now.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.180
To shield them from insects and rain,

16:24.180 --> 16:28.180
Jamie and Georgie have decided to build a raised bed with a roof.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.180
It's a very busy camp today

16:31.180 --> 16:34.180
to make sure we have a good shelter for us.

16:34.180 --> 16:36.180
And our fire is as dry as a boat.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.180
All hands on deck.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.180
Down, down, down, down, down, down, there.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.180
That's it, you got it.

16:46.180 --> 16:49.180
Shall I go that end and push? Yeah.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.180
Where's everybody gone?

16:51.180 --> 16:52.180
I think Harvey and...

16:52.180 --> 16:54.180
Me and Jamie are having a lie down.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.180
It's just got too serious.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.180
And I know we've got jobs to do,

16:59.180 --> 17:01.180
but why is there so much pressure all of a sudden?

17:01.180 --> 17:03.180
Guys, we haven't finished!

17:03.180 --> 17:05.180
I know, I know we're not finished.

17:05.180 --> 17:07.180
I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.

17:07.180 --> 17:10.180
Ah! So give me a break, please.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.180
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying you haven't finished.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.180
That's all. Right.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.180
Just whack them all on now.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.180
Oh, God.

17:18.180 --> 17:19.180
I'm sorry.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.180
I'm sorry.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.180
I'm sorry.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.180
I'm sorry.

17:22.180 --> 17:23.180
I'm sorry.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.180
I think I might go on strike tomorrow.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.180
Let's get this roof on, guys, and then we can have a proper tidy.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.180
I'm going to kill myself with these fucking rockets.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.180
While the rest of the group toil away on the bed shelter...

17:41.180 --> 17:44.180
..Jamie and Belinda decide to take the afternoon off.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.180
I kind of feel a little bit like, you know when someone comes into your house

17:51.180 --> 17:58.180
and takes a massive shit in your toilet, eats all your food, messes your house,

17:58.180 --> 18:00.180
and then leaves and goes, ''Bye now!''

18:03.180 --> 18:07.180
We have been upset and tired and angry,

18:07.180 --> 18:10.180
and so there's only so long that those things can go on for

18:10.180 --> 18:12.180
until you have to do something.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.180
So we have to change it.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.180
If we're not happy, then do something about it.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.180
Beth and Lauren take decisive action.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.180
They call an election.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.180
Jamie!

18:22.180 --> 18:23.180
Hi.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.180
Hi, love.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.180
We're having a meeting.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.180
Clothes are optional.

18:28.180 --> 18:31.180
I find Jamie so unpredictable.

18:31.180 --> 18:35.180
I don't know if she's going to shrug it off and just say, ''Oh, do you know what, whatever,''

18:35.180 --> 18:37.180
or if she's going to kick off about it.

18:39.180 --> 18:41.180
All the great expeditions have always had a leader,

18:41.180 --> 18:44.180
whether it's Amazon, Scott or Shackleton,

18:44.180 --> 18:47.180
but resistance to leadership is not uncommon.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.180
We've called this meeting today...

18:50.180 --> 18:53.180
..because not much has changed

18:53.180 --> 18:57.180
and most people still want a leader.

18:58.180 --> 19:03.180
If anybody would like to go for leadership,

19:03.180 --> 19:07.180
please make yourself be known.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.180
Me and Beth.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.180
I'm confused, to be honest.

19:18.180 --> 19:21.180
What's so bad?

19:21.180 --> 19:25.180
We need a leader so everyone knows exactly what they're doing.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.180
You know my feelings on the leadership.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.180
Not happy with it.

19:30.180 --> 19:32.180
Our whole experience has been amazing

19:32.180 --> 19:35.180
and so I just want to end on success

19:35.180 --> 19:37.180
and it means a lot, I think, to show that we never gave up.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.180
Yeah. Yeah.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.180
I so get you.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.180
I so want Bear to come and look at our camp and think,

19:44.180 --> 19:46.180
''Crikey, those girls were good.''

19:46.180 --> 19:47.180
Do we need to take a vote?

19:47.180 --> 19:49.180
I think we should just go forwards with it

19:49.180 --> 19:52.180
because you're the only people who want to do it.

19:52.180 --> 19:54.180
You're happy to go with Beth and Lauren?

19:54.180 --> 19:56.180
Are people happy with that?

20:00.180 --> 20:01.180
Jamie?

20:01.180 --> 20:02.180
Yeah.

20:05.180 --> 20:08.180
Lauren and Beth are going to run the leadership jointly.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.180
After all of that, well done.

20:13.180 --> 20:14.180
Thank you.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.180
Be proud of yourselves.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.180
Yeah.

20:16.180 --> 20:21.180
I was so nervous leading up to it.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.180
I was just thinking, ''Oh, my God, how's this going to be taken?''

20:24.180 --> 20:25.180
Especially after the other day.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.180
But, actually, it seemed pretty positive.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.180
We need to just straighten out this end.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.180
The new leader's first priority is to feed everyone.

20:38.180 --> 20:41.180
We are now going to move the nets, basically,

20:41.180 --> 20:43.180
at a different angle in the sea.

20:43.180 --> 20:45.180
So, hopefully, we can get a fish.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.180
Yeah.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.180
We can get a fish.

20:49.180 --> 20:52.180
Together, the women have untangled the vital fishing net.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.180
OK. Keep it up.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.180
They're now determined to finally land a big catch.

21:00.180 --> 21:02.180
I think the net is great.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.180
I think at least we're trying.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.180
I think God loves to try it.

21:07.180 --> 21:10.180
I think that Jamie is just feeling undervalued,

21:10.180 --> 21:12.180
that sort of thing.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.180
With all ten women needed to tackle a food crisis,

21:15.180 --> 21:18.180
Lauren has to bring Jamie back into the fold.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.180
We need every single one of those girls in the group

21:20.180 --> 21:22.180
to get through this.

21:22.180 --> 21:25.180
I know what it feels like to fail

21:25.180 --> 21:27.180
at something that you give your all to,

21:27.180 --> 21:30.180
and I'm not prepared to go through that again.

21:32.180 --> 21:36.180
I probably picture myself as a bit of a young leader.

21:36.180 --> 21:39.180
In 2013, I decided to row across the Atlantic.

21:39.180 --> 21:42.180
But the boat capsized, I split my head open.

21:42.180 --> 21:45.180
The failure of the row just left a huge void in me.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.180
And then I thought, yep,

21:47.180 --> 21:49.180
the island is definitely something I want to do.

21:49.180 --> 21:51.180
This is definitely how I'm going to get it back.

21:51.180 --> 21:55.180
I always give my everything to whatever challenge I set myself.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.180
So when I fail, I feel...

21:58.180 --> 22:00.180
I feel that in a big way.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.180
Jay? Jamie?

22:04.180 --> 22:06.180
So, I just want to clear the air.

22:06.180 --> 22:09.180
I was feeling like you weren't helping out,

22:09.180 --> 22:12.180
but what I should have done, absolutely what I should have done,

22:12.180 --> 22:14.180
is come and talk to you about it.

22:15.180 --> 22:18.180
I remember I woke up with them bites all over my face,

22:18.180 --> 22:21.180
and that put me in a sort of vicious cycle

22:21.180 --> 22:24.180
where I was, like, just not enjoying being here

22:24.180 --> 22:27.180
and not motivated to do anything.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.180
Get more involved. If you want to do stuff, like...

22:30.180 --> 22:33.180
I do sometimes feel like I can't be arsed.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.180
SHE LAUGHS

22:35.180 --> 22:37.180
Oh, no!

22:37.180 --> 22:38.180
I'm sorry.

22:38.180 --> 22:40.180
I...

22:40.180 --> 22:42.180
..probably come across selfish,

22:42.180 --> 22:44.180
but I hope that they can...

22:45.180 --> 22:49.180
..understand that I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...

22:52.180 --> 22:56.180
..I don't want to leave, you know, this island

22:56.180 --> 22:58.180
feeling sour and bitter.

23:00.180 --> 23:03.180
So, I think we're here. Yeah.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.180
So, this is our beach.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.180
Lauren's plan now is to search for food

23:07.180 --> 23:09.180
beyond the confines of their beach.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.180
We go up that track until we hit that middle path. Correct.

23:12.180 --> 23:14.180
Then we go down with the sea.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.180
Always on our left-hand side.

23:17.180 --> 23:20.180
She leads a hunting party deep into the jungle.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.180
See you later.

23:22.180 --> 23:23.180
Along the coast...

23:23.180 --> 23:25.180
SHE SCREAMS

23:25.180 --> 23:29.180
Oh! My nail got stuck in this fucking gooey bat!

23:29.180 --> 23:33.180
..vegetarian Jamie has volunteered to scavenge for limpets

23:33.180 --> 23:35.180
to feed the rest of the group.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.180
Oh, my God. Honestly, what is that?

23:37.180 --> 23:39.180
Oh!

23:39.180 --> 23:42.180
SHE SCREAMS

23:42.180 --> 23:44.180
Anything?

23:44.180 --> 23:46.180
Does that look rotten to you?

23:46.180 --> 23:49.180
Yeah, yeah, an animal's been at it.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.180
We've got snails the size of your head.

23:51.180 --> 23:54.180
Woo-hoo! Shut the front door.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.180
Wow!

23:56.180 --> 23:58.180
The women on the other side of the island

23:58.180 --> 24:01.180
are still on the hunt for yucca.

24:01.180 --> 24:05.180
It would really suck to have come all of this way

24:05.180 --> 24:07.180
and not find yucca.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.180
Guys, I've just found a tin of something.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.180
Whoa!

24:14.180 --> 24:16.180
It might be a tin of peaches.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
Oh, my God.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.180
Thanks, baby.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.180
SHE SCREAMS

24:20.180 --> 24:23.180
Oh, my God!

24:23.180 --> 24:25.180
That's going to make everyone super happy.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.180
Yeah.

24:27.180 --> 24:28.180
Guys!

24:28.180 --> 24:30.180
Chloe!

24:30.180 --> 24:34.180
We found two tins of baked beans!

24:34.180 --> 24:36.180
You found beans?

24:36.180 --> 24:37.180
SHE SCREAMS

24:37.180 --> 24:40.180
The rusty tins are packed with protein and sugar

24:40.180 --> 24:43.180
and may have been left by a hunting party from another island.

24:43.180 --> 24:45.180
It's a lucky find.

24:45.180 --> 24:49.180
Tonight, my dear, we have got a baked bean.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.180
I can't wait.

24:51.180 --> 24:53.180
I can't wait to eat it.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
Oh!

24:55.180 --> 24:57.180
What is in the tin?

24:57.180 --> 24:59.180
Oh, wow!

24:59.180 --> 25:01.180
It couldn't be better news for Jamie,

25:01.180 --> 25:05.180
who survived on nothing but coconuts for weeks.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.180
Fucking hell.

25:07.180 --> 25:09.180
Oh, my God!

25:09.180 --> 25:12.180
Is that not the nicest baked bean you've ever had in your life?

25:12.180 --> 25:13.180
Beans!

25:13.180 --> 25:16.180
You've actually turned the day around completely.

25:16.180 --> 25:19.180
Thank you very much, Jamie.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.180
Yeah, that was really sweet.

25:21.180 --> 25:25.180
I've never been so excited about baked beans in all my life.

25:25.180 --> 25:28.180
Oh, my God, this is amazing! This is amazing!

25:28.180 --> 25:31.180
Oh, my God, what are we doing passing it round?

25:31.180 --> 25:34.180
I can't even begin to tell you how good they are.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.180
Oh, my God!

25:39.180 --> 25:41.180
Sweet, yummy.

25:42.180 --> 25:45.180
Tasty, tasty. Protein.

25:45.180 --> 25:48.180
Thank you so much, girls.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.180
From today onwards,

25:50.180 --> 25:53.180
we're going to try and think about what needs to be done

25:53.180 --> 25:58.180
to get the whole group to kind of work as one machine

25:58.180 --> 26:01.180
to a point where we do have enough food.

26:01.180 --> 26:05.180
It's Jamie's first belly-filling meal on the island.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.180
Come on!

26:07.180 --> 26:09.180
It's been six weeks!

26:09.180 --> 26:11.180
No, it's been longer than that.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.180
Oh, do you know what? Do you want to hear a funny story?

26:14.180 --> 26:16.180
Oh, my God, this is hilarious.

26:16.180 --> 26:20.180
As a dental technician, you know, like, the mould that you take of the teeth?

26:20.180 --> 26:24.180
Well, you can use that stuff for also taking an impression of your cock.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.180
That ex-boyfriend came round for dinner.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.180
It was going on and on and on.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.180
I want you to do my willy, I want you to do my...

26:30.180 --> 26:32.180
Honestly, I've still got it to this day,

26:32.180 --> 26:35.180
this big stone plaster cast of a willy.

26:35.180 --> 26:37.180
Wow!

26:37.180 --> 26:40.180
And it's like a lethal weapon, it weighs a tonne.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.180
LAUGHTER

26:42.180 --> 26:45.180
I personally have struggled.

26:45.180 --> 26:48.180
Jesus, I have struggled.

26:48.180 --> 26:50.180
But you know what?

26:50.180 --> 26:53.180
To everyone that thought I wasn't going to survive...

26:55.180 --> 26:56.180
..I'm here still.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.180
Hiya!

27:04.180 --> 27:05.180
6am.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.180
We are on our way to catch some fishes.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.180
Leaders Lauren and Jamie

27:12.180 --> 27:14.180
and Lauren and Beth decide the time has come

27:14.180 --> 27:17.180
for an all-out assault to conquer the island.

27:17.180 --> 27:20.180
For the survivor, determination is a critical one

27:20.180 --> 27:24.180
and I love that Winston Churchill quote that sums it up.

27:24.180 --> 27:28.180
It just says, never, ever, ever quit.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.180
Oh, that is beautiful.

27:33.180 --> 27:36.180
So far, a big fish haul has eluded them.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.180
The women are now praying their plan to reposition the net

27:39.180 --> 27:41.180
has been successful.

27:41.180 --> 27:45.180
I would give anything for there to be fish in this net now.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.180
I'm scared, I don't want to look.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.180
I'm in fear of disappointment.

27:51.180 --> 27:53.180
Oh, what was that?

27:53.180 --> 27:55.180
What have we got? What have we got?

27:55.180 --> 27:59.180
So far, we've got two catfish, one other fish, two stingrays.

27:59.180 --> 28:00.180
Yes!

28:00.180 --> 28:02.180
LAUGHTER

28:02.180 --> 28:03.180
Yes!

28:03.180 --> 28:05.180
I'm so happy.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.180
I'm so happy.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.180
Give me!

28:09.180 --> 28:11.180
Yes!

28:11.180 --> 28:14.180
She'll have a fishy on a little dishy

28:14.180 --> 28:15.180
She'll have a fishy...

28:15.180 --> 28:17.180
Another stingray! Two!

28:17.180 --> 28:19.180
Awesome work, awesome work.

28:23.180 --> 28:25.180
So happy, it makes you so happy,

28:25.180 --> 28:27.180
like, to know that you're going to eat.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.180
That worry's not there now.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.180
But it's sort of proved

28:34.180 --> 28:37.180
that our survival skills aren't that bad

28:37.180 --> 28:38.180
and we can make it work.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.180
Yeah.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.180
I do miss toilet seats.

28:49.180 --> 28:52.180
Yeah, I can't wait to have a poo in the toilet.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.180
Three days left on the island.

28:54.180 --> 28:56.180
Guys, what's the plan for today?

28:56.180 --> 28:59.180
We need two people to do water collection, ASAP.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.180
I don't mind doing it again.

29:00.180 --> 29:02.180
We just need to get shitloads of wood.

29:02.180 --> 29:05.180
Then we're going to get on to cleaning this area,

29:05.180 --> 29:07.180
cos it's gross.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.180
Top plan, I love a plan.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.180
Five minutes.

29:11.180 --> 29:15.180
Lauren's new daily rota is galvanising the women.

29:15.180 --> 29:16.180
Lauren, what are we doing?

29:16.180 --> 29:18.180
Sweeping away the leaves.

29:18.180 --> 29:21.180
Cos we're girls and we like a clean floor.

29:23.180 --> 29:25.180
I'm going to put this over your head.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.180
Oh, my God!

29:26.180 --> 29:28.180
Get the camera down!

29:28.180 --> 29:29.180
Oh, my God!

29:31.180 --> 29:35.180
We've started to line the entrance with coconuts.

29:35.180 --> 29:36.180
Now what we need is some candles.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.180
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

29:37.180 --> 29:39.180
Oh, wouldn't that be dreamy?

29:39.180 --> 29:41.180
Seashell bunting.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.180
It's absolutely beautiful.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.180
I love making stuff.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.180
That'll cost a fortune back home.

29:45.180 --> 29:48.180
These guys can come together, they can look after each other,

29:48.180 --> 29:49.180
they can build community,

29:49.180 --> 29:52.180
they can find that kind of something inside that drives them on,

29:52.180 --> 29:54.180
that positive stuff.

29:54.180 --> 29:56.180
But also, ultimately, they're not just surviving,

29:56.180 --> 29:58.180
they're now learning to thrive.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.180
And that's when you kind of see the magic.

30:00.180 --> 30:03.180
We've got enough food now, we've got enough water,

30:03.180 --> 30:06.180
we've kept the fire going, and so our priority now is shelter.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.180
Oh, here's a big bastard.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.180
A big jobby.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.180
Until that boat rocks up on this shore,

30:17.180 --> 30:20.180
we're going to be tidying up, organising,

30:20.180 --> 30:21.180
so it's about pride,

30:21.180 --> 30:23.180
and it's wanting to show to the world

30:23.180 --> 30:26.180
that what the majority of females are made of

30:26.180 --> 30:28.180
and what we're capable of doing with nothing.

30:28.180 --> 30:30.180
Oh, my God!

30:31.180 --> 30:33.180
It's like a tent, isn't it?

30:33.180 --> 30:34.180
Ooh!

30:34.180 --> 30:35.180
Oh-ho!

30:35.180 --> 30:36.180
Ooh!

30:37.180 --> 30:39.180
Oh, God, it's nice, you know. It's a bit noisy.

30:39.180 --> 30:42.180
Yeah, but... Oh, God, but it's comfortable.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.180
Oh, it's lovely.

30:44.180 --> 30:47.180
That is mega-wow!

30:47.180 --> 30:50.180
I could rest my bones here for a while, me thinks.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.180
And teamwork.

30:51.180 --> 30:54.180
It's nice that we've all built something together, you know?

30:54.180 --> 30:56.180
And I think it's amazing and awesome.

30:58.180 --> 30:59.180
Carnival!

30:59.180 --> 31:01.180
We'll take it to Rio.

31:01.180 --> 31:05.180
Beth and Lauren's vision for how the island should run began.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.180
Jesus, how much better is it?

31:07.180 --> 31:09.180
I cannot begin to tell you.

31:09.180 --> 31:12.180
Babes, come outside, I've got a present for you.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.180
OK, close your eyes.

31:13.180 --> 31:14.180
What is it?

31:14.180 --> 31:15.180
Ready?

31:17.180 --> 31:19.180
You fucking bitch!

31:19.180 --> 31:21.180
I knew it was something like that!

31:21.180 --> 31:23.180
I know you, you little bitch.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.180
Relationships are renewed.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.180
The camp is now secure and comfortable,

31:29.180 --> 31:31.180
and finally there's food on the table.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.180
This is our first lunch.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.180
Now we've worked it out,

31:34.180 --> 31:38.180
and I really think we have worked out how to do it.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.180
Yay!

31:40.180 --> 31:42.180
We've survived.

31:42.180 --> 31:46.180
And most of all, now we are thriving.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.180
Is the tide coming in or going out?

31:50.180 --> 31:51.180
Coming in.

31:53.180 --> 31:56.180
Becky, Lauren and Beth brave the morning tide

31:56.180 --> 31:58.180
to fetch water for the camp.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.180
We made it!

31:59.180 --> 32:01.180
Whoo!

32:01.180 --> 32:03.180
As they head back, Lauren and Beth

32:03.180 --> 32:05.180
make a discovery.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.180
Becky!

32:07.180 --> 32:09.180
Oh, look what we found here!

32:09.180 --> 32:10.180
Oh!

32:10.180 --> 32:12.180
Oh, hi there!

32:13.180 --> 32:14.180
Come and join me, ladies.

32:14.180 --> 32:16.180
Yay!

32:16.180 --> 32:19.180
Lauren plans to use a washed-up polystyrene block

32:19.180 --> 32:22.180
as a raft to make the exhausting daily water run

32:22.180 --> 32:24.180
easier and quicker.

32:24.180 --> 32:26.180
Are you kidding me?

32:26.180 --> 32:27.180
What?

32:27.180 --> 32:29.180
The Vader raft?

32:29.180 --> 32:31.180
That is amazing!

32:31.180 --> 32:32.180
Whoo!

32:33.180 --> 32:39.180
I never, ever thought it was going to be

32:39.180 --> 32:40.180
as hard as it has been.

32:40.180 --> 32:43.180
If I can complete this, then I know within myself

32:43.180 --> 32:47.180
that I didn't fail at rowing across the Atlantic.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.180
And I need that.

32:48.180 --> 32:49.180
I need that closure.

32:49.180 --> 32:52.180
I need that feeling that I am strong enough

32:52.180 --> 32:54.180
within myself to finish something.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.180
We come with water.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.180
This hand is next to the navy.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.180
Bear grouse can bugger off.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.180
We've got Lauren.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.180
We're fine.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.180
I'm coming!

33:04.180 --> 33:06.180
With the fight for survival mastered,

33:06.180 --> 33:09.180
they can now embrace the island's delights.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.180
Great swim!

33:13.180 --> 33:15.180
I think in both survival and in life,

33:15.180 --> 33:17.180
you know, good things and worthwhile things

33:17.180 --> 33:18.180
don't always come easy.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.180
And for those that can endure on the island,

33:21.180 --> 33:23.180
there will come a time when they will be able

33:23.180 --> 33:24.180
to make the most of it.

33:24.180 --> 33:26.180
And I think that's what we're going to do.

33:26.180 --> 33:29.180
I'm sure on the island there will come a sense of pride

33:29.180 --> 33:31.180
that money really can't buy, you know,

33:31.180 --> 33:33.180
and it's a pride that will have been hard earned

33:33.180 --> 33:36.180
through heart, through grit and through endeavour.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.180
What are we up to?

33:47.180 --> 33:50.180
We're going to check the net and...

33:50.180 --> 33:51.180
Crab hunting!

33:51.180 --> 33:53.180
Woo-hoo!

33:53.180 --> 33:55.180
So excited!

33:56.180 --> 33:59.180
As their days on the island draw to a close,

33:59.180 --> 34:03.180
the women are seizing every opportunity to get food.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.180
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

34:05.180 --> 34:06.180
Oh!

34:06.180 --> 34:07.180
Julie's got a big one!

34:07.180 --> 34:08.180
Right, got him!

34:08.180 --> 34:09.180
Give us that bucket!

34:09.180 --> 34:11.180
Yeah, go on, get him in, yeah!

34:11.180 --> 34:12.180
In, in, in!

34:12.180 --> 34:13.180
Woo!

34:13.180 --> 34:14.180
You got another one?

34:14.180 --> 34:15.180
Yeah!

34:15.180 --> 34:16.180
Oh!

34:16.180 --> 34:17.180
Julie!

34:17.180 --> 34:19.180
Don't let him into your bucket!

34:19.180 --> 34:21.180
He's in, he's in, he's in.

34:21.180 --> 34:22.180
Great, great.

34:22.180 --> 34:24.180
He's a fucking monster, that one.

34:24.180 --> 34:25.180
Yeah.

34:25.180 --> 34:28.180
Julie, you've turned into an absolute animal.

34:28.180 --> 34:29.180
Get in there.

34:29.180 --> 34:31.180
Oh, my God.

34:31.180 --> 34:33.180
What's happened to me?

34:33.180 --> 34:36.180
I was a lady in the pool.

34:38.180 --> 34:40.180
To follow the crab starter,

34:40.180 --> 34:43.180
they're hoping to catch a main course in their fishing net.

34:44.180 --> 34:47.180
This one's very...wrunkled.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.180
Have a quick look.

34:49.180 --> 34:51.180
There's the butter.

34:52.180 --> 34:54.180
There's a fish, there's a fish!

34:54.180 --> 34:55.180
No.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:56.180 --> 34:57.180
Got a big one!

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
Wow!

34:58.180 --> 34:59.180
Fuck me, what is it?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.180
What is it?

35:00.180 --> 35:01.180
It's huge!

35:01.180 --> 35:02.180
It's a shark!

35:02.180 --> 35:03.180
A shark!

35:03.180 --> 35:04.180
He's still alive!

35:04.180 --> 35:05.180
I need something to hit him with.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.180
I need a big piece of wood.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.180
OK, OK, I'll get it.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.180
There's a bit of wood.

35:08.180 --> 35:09.180
I've got it.

35:09.180 --> 35:10.180
I've got it.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.180
Ready?

35:11.180 --> 35:12.180
I've got it.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.180
I've got it.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.180
I've got it.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.180
I've got it.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.180
I've got it.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.180
I've got it.

35:17.180 --> 35:18.180
I've got it.

35:18.180 --> 35:19.180
I've got it.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.180
I've got it.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.180
I've got it.

35:21.180 --> 35:22.180
I've got it.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.180
I've got it.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.180
I've got it.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.180
I've got it.

35:25.180 --> 35:26.180
Ok, good job, guys.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.180
I hope everyone's hungry!

35:27.180 --> 35:28.180
Right, come on, ladies.

35:28.180 --> 35:29.180
Soapies!

35:29.180 --> 35:30.180
Fish for breakfast, Fish for supper.

35:30.180 --> 35:31.180
Nailing it!

35:31.180 --> 35:35.260
Here, take this one.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.180
That's delicious.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.520
Foo Corn!

35:38.880 --> 35:42.080
Look at the colour!

35:42.080 --> 35:43.080
Foo Corn!

35:43.080 --> 35:44.180
Thank you, all.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.180
Foo Corn!

35:45.180 --> 35:47.080
Thank you, all!

35:47.080 --> 35:48.080
Foo Corn!

35:48.080 --> 35:49.080
Foo Corn!

35:49.080 --> 35:50.080
Right, I am.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.080
Foo Corn!

35:51.080 --> 35:52.080
Foo Corn!

35:52.080 --> 35:53.080
Foo Corn!

35:53.080 --> 35:56.080
Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is Bravo, Emma.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
This is Foxtrot.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
I have for some news for you, ladies.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.080
Tomorrow, a man called Bear will be coming to your island.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
You are coming home.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:13.080 --> 36:16.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:16.080 --> 36:18.080
Yay!

36:18.080 --> 36:20.080
Wow!

36:20.080 --> 36:25.080
We've got on the island and we've actually done it.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.080
Well done. Well done.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.080
It's mad. I feel numb and I feel fear.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.080
You know when you've had, like, a near miss in the car or something...

36:33.080 --> 36:35.080
Yeah. ..and you go like...

36:35.080 --> 36:37.080
..like that, and then it hits and you go a bit numb

36:37.080 --> 36:40.080
and you have to pull over cos you're a bit shaky? Yeah.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.080
I feel like I've just been nearly hit.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.080
It's a women's final night on the island.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.080
OK, so we need to find some sort of cup. Do we have a sort of cup?

36:48.080 --> 36:50.080
And there's much to celebrate.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.080
Yeah.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.080
Oh!

36:53.080 --> 36:56.080
I got my ticket for the long way round

36:56.080 --> 36:59.080
Two bottle whiskies by the way

36:59.080 --> 37:03.080
And I sugar like some sweet company

37:03.080 --> 37:07.080
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?

37:07.080 --> 37:11.080
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

37:11.080 --> 37:14.080
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

37:14.080 --> 37:16.080
You're gonna miss me by my hair

37:16.080 --> 37:18.080
You're gonna miss me everywhere

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
Oh, you're still gonna miss me

37:20.080 --> 37:22.080
When I'm gone

37:30.080 --> 37:33.080
Life is either a great adventure or nothing.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
As fast as we can!

37:35.080 --> 37:39.080
We're a group of completely ordinary, down-to-earth women.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
Oh!

37:41.080 --> 37:43.080
You fucking snake, it came towards me!

37:43.080 --> 37:45.080
It came right at me!

37:46.080 --> 37:48.080
With no survival experience.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.080
Fuck.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
Oh my god, there's a caiman.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
That is a big fucker.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.080
We faced adversity every step of the way.

37:56.080 --> 38:00.080
We cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.080
But we kept fighting.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
Get the knife, get the knife!

38:03.080 --> 38:07.080
You are not leaving this island till the fucking end game, right?

38:09.080 --> 38:11.080
We were wet, cold and starving.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.080
I just need to get some food. Just something.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
Yet we found the strength

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
to keep pushing on.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.080
Look at that little fire.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
Fucking giant one!

38:23.080 --> 38:24.080
Look at this!

38:24.080 --> 38:26.080
If we hadn't have kept going,

38:26.080 --> 38:28.080
it would have been the end.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.080
In time, those memories will fade.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
But what we will remember

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
are the women we experienced it with,

38:39.080 --> 38:41.080
the friendships,

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
and how they made us feel.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.080
Yeah!

38:45.080 --> 38:47.080
We're winning.

38:49.080 --> 38:52.080
Tomorrow, the women finally go home.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.080
It's really weird.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.080
We all feel so comfortable, in a way, with each other.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
Sort of like a family.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
I want to go home, but I don't want to leave.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
I know.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.080
I know what you mean.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
Is that a boat? That's his boat.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.080
Oh, my god.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
We've never done this before.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.080
14 women left on their own with nothing

39:12.080 --> 39:14.080
in some of the harshest environments on the planet.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.080
You know, they really are just ordinary people

39:16.080 --> 39:17.080
from all walks of life.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
Whoo!

39:18.080 --> 39:20.080
And it hasn't just pushed them to the limits.

39:20.080 --> 39:23.080
To be honest, it will have pushed them beyond that.

39:23.080 --> 39:27.080
And what speaks volumes is that they're still there.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
Whoo!

39:33.080 --> 39:35.080
Yes!

39:35.080 --> 39:37.080
Ten very grateful women.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.080
Oh, god.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.080
Oh, my god, it's actually happening.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.080
It's actually happening.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.080
This is amazing.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.080
Whoo!

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
Whoo!

39:45.080 --> 39:46.080
Whoo!

39:46.080 --> 39:47.080
Whoo!

39:47.080 --> 39:48.080
Whoo!

39:48.080 --> 39:49.080
Whoo!

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
Whoo!

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Whoo!

39:51.080 --> 39:52.080
Whoo!

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
Wow.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
Hi.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.080
Hi.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.080
Welcome.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.080
Wow.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.080
Look at you.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
Look at you guys.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
This is how best it is.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.080
Genuinely, what you've been through, respect.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.080
Thank you.

40:03.080 --> 40:09.080
You now understand this stuff is tough, you know?

40:09.080 --> 40:11.080
Thank you.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.080
Well done, you.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.080
Well done, you.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.080
Well, welcome.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.080
Wow, look at this. This is cool.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.080
It's very cool. Here's our art installation.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.080
And it's so clean.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.080
I love this.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.080
That's Harvey.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.080
Thank you.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
It's the little touches.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.080
We've got a bed made of bottles

40:27.080 --> 40:29.080
and a separate area for sitting and lounging around

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
and, you know, just generally hanging out.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.080
This is so smart. It's getting you off the ground,

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
but it's communal.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.080
Let's face it, girls, we like spoons, don't we?

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
We love a spoon. We love a spoon.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.080
We've met the stereotype

40:43.080 --> 40:47.080
with our decorations and our little feminine touches,

40:47.080 --> 40:50.080
but totally blown it away

40:50.080 --> 40:53.080
by the strength and the stamina

40:53.080 --> 40:56.080
and the guts and the determination.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.080
These women have got balls,

40:59.080 --> 41:02.080
and big balls at last.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.080
I would agree with that.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
You ready to get the hell off this island?

41:05.080 --> 41:08.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:08.080 --> 41:09.080
Dude! Dude!

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:13.080 --> 41:15.080
If I hadn't turned up today,

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
and I turn up in six months,

41:17.080 --> 41:19.080
I bet these guys would be in pretty good shape.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
Oh, don't be mean to me.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.080
Don't be mean to me.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
And I knew it.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.080
I knew the stereotype was wrong, you know?

41:29.080 --> 41:31.080
But I knew they could nail this.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.080
And for me, I'm so genuinely proud

41:34.080 --> 41:36.080
of what they have achieved.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.080
And they should be. And they are.

41:38.080 --> 41:41.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:41.080 --> 41:42.080
Woo!

41:42.080 --> 41:44.080
Thank you.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:47.080 --> 41:49.080
Oh, my God!

41:49.080 --> 41:51.080
Oh, my God!

41:51.080 --> 41:52.080
Oh, my God!

41:52.080 --> 41:55.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:55.080 --> 41:58.080
I'm so proud of all of us that we've achieved this.

41:58.080 --> 42:02.080
We have shown the world that women can achieve anything.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.080
What I've learned is I need to appreciate

42:06.080 --> 42:07.080
what I've got right now

42:07.080 --> 42:10.080
and not strive to look for other better things.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
I think it's made me more confident.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.080
I've gained.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.080
I've decided that I'm OK.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.080
I'm not such a bad person.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.080
I'm a good skin.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.080
But being here, I felt so alive.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
And I thought, God, this is me.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.080
I feel happy.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.080
And so, yeah, for me, I feel like this is it.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.080
This is where I get something out of life.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.080
And I want to run with it.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.080
But I've survived for nearly two months,

42:39.080 --> 42:40.080
and we've done it.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.080
I can do any shit that I want.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.080
And so can anybody else.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.080
And it's brilliant.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.080
We're amazing.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.080
Woo!

42:51.080 --> 42:53.080
We're nearly there!

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
Yes!

42:55.080 --> 42:57.080
OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.

42:57.080 --> 42:58.080
Yeah!

42:58.080 --> 42:59.080
Oh!

42:59.080 --> 43:00.080
Oh!

43:00.080 --> 43:01.080
Oh!

43:01.080 --> 43:02.080
Oh!

43:02.080 --> 43:03.080
Oh!

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
I'm so glad I made it.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
I can't believe I made it.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.080
I'm getting emotional over that.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.080
I've just been that brave.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
I've been really brave.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.080
Oh, for me.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.080
The women have had no contact with the outside world

43:21.080 --> 43:24.080
and loved ones for six weeks.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.080
Hi, Mum.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.080
Are you OK?

43:36.080 --> 43:38.080
Are you OK?

43:38.080 --> 43:40.080
Yeah, it was amazing.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.080
It was really fucking hard as well.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.080
Hello?

43:44.080 --> 43:45.080
Hello?

43:47.080 --> 43:48.080
Oh, my God!

43:48.080 --> 43:49.080
Baby!

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
We can't wait to see you.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.080
Yeah.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.080
I've loved...

43:55.080 --> 43:58.080
I've missed you all as well more than I ever imagined.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.080
Hello, Daddy.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.080
I've missed you so much.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.080
Oh, God.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
It's, like, sensational.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.080
Oh.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
Oh, my God.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.080
Having been stripped of any luxuries,

44:10.080 --> 44:11.080
they're finally reintroduced to the modern world.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.080
Oh, my God.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.080
How nice does that feel?

44:13.080 --> 44:14.080
What's this?

44:14.080 --> 44:15.080
Ooh!

44:15.080 --> 44:16.080
Oh!

44:16.080 --> 44:17.080
What's it like?

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
Oh, look at my hair.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.080
Amazing.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.080
The way it cuts your bottom.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.080
What the hell?

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
My eyebrows!

44:22.080 --> 44:23.080
God, it's so clear.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.080
Oh, my God.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.080
Oh, my God.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.080
Oh, my God.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
Oh, my God.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.080
Oh, my God.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.080
Oh, my God.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.080
Oh, my God.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.080
Oh, my God.

44:31.080 --> 44:32.080
Oh, my God.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.080
Oh, my God.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.080
Oh, my God.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.080
Oh, my God.

44:35.080 --> 44:36.080
Oh, my God.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.080
Oh, my God.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.080
Oh, my God.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.080
Oh, my God.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.080
Oh, my God.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.080
Oh, my God.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.080
Oh, my God.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.080
Oh, my God.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.080
Oh, my God.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.080
Oh, my God.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
It's so clean.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
I love clean, being clean, you know.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
This is amazing!

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
The women's bodies are in a fragile state,

44:49.080 --> 44:53.060
and for the first three days, they must stick to a simple diet.

44:53.060 --> 44:54.060
No!

44:54.060 --> 44:55.060
That drinks.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.060
Yay!

44:56.060 --> 44:57.060
That is great.

44:57.060 --> 44:58.060
Thank you very much.

44:58.060 --> 44:59.060
Is this chicken?

44:59.060 --> 45:00.060
Oh!

45:00.060 --> 45:01.060
Yes, it is.

45:01.060 --> 45:02.060
Even the smell of the rice.

45:02.060 --> 45:03.060
It's so good.

45:03.060 --> 45:04.060
Oh, my God.

45:04.060 --> 45:05.060
I mean, it's so good.

45:05.060 --> 45:06.060
It's so good.

45:06.060 --> 45:07.060
This is good.

45:13.580 --> 45:16.060
It's our first meal off the island, girls.

45:16.140 --> 45:18.660
Cheers!

45:18.740 --> 45:20.540
Cheers!

45:22.460 --> 45:26.820
This experiment ultimately shows that, really, it isn't about gender.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.500
It's about attitude.

45:28.580 --> 45:32.060
Some people have that heart and mind of a survivor.

45:32.140 --> 45:34.340
Determined, team players,

45:34.340 --> 45:36.180
hard-working, resourceful.

45:36.260 --> 45:41.500
What these ordinary women have been through genuinely is remarkable.

45:41.580 --> 45:43.860
They've endured unbelievable hardships

45:43.940 --> 45:47.940
and they've come out of it empowered and positive.

45:48.020 --> 45:51.020
And for that, they've won my respect.

45:51.100 --> 45:52.100
Big time.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.060
It's like the best company ever, isn't it?

46:04.340 --> 46:06.340
Hello!

46:08.180 --> 46:11.180
You can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.

46:13.220 --> 46:14.420
Please, walk!

46:14.500 --> 46:15.500
Walk!

46:17.900 --> 46:21.300
Next time, it's the final instalment of the men's island.

46:23.860 --> 46:25.260
I'm going to go to hell for this.

46:25.340 --> 46:26.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:26.940 --> 46:27.940
I'm a scorpion.

46:28.020 --> 46:29.820
People are just starting not to give a shit anymore.

46:29.900 --> 46:31.620
Come on, boys!

46:31.700 --> 46:33.620
Son!

46:33.620 --> 46:36.740
Mother Nature and this island will bite you whenever she feels fit.

47:03.620 --> 47:06.180
It only starts on the first week of the trip.

47:06.260 --> 47:07.460
Suzanne, stay here!

47:07.540 --> 47:09.300
I'll meet you in my cell.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.380
Hey, Dan!

47:10.700 --> 47:12.060
Thar...

47:12.140 --> 47:13.500
Humph!

47:14.580 --> 47:16.100
It's a poder safety method,

47:16.180 --> 47:17.220
I'd say it's about time.

47:17.300 --> 47:18.220
Not yet.

47:18.620 --> 47:19.620
The options are like that.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.300
You dirty seagulls.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.620
It'd be happiness for me to know

47:22.700 --> 47:24.980
what exactly those seagulls think about that labor.

47:25.060 --> 47:26.540
Some get by time to get the farm going.

47:26.620 --> 47:27.660
If you are going to do it,

47:27.740 --> 47:28.700
start in the headaches.

47:28.780 --> 47:30.940
If you continue to work with a double,

47:31.020 --> 47:32.020
not an founders' job.

47:32.100 --> 47:32.900
You deal with it.
