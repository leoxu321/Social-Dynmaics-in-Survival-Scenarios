0	14940	Two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one has been inhabited by 14
14940	23280	British men while a separate island was home to 14 British women they've been utterly alone
23280	33300	with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything
33300	45780	themselves the women have made it off alive tonight it's a final installment of the men's
45780	53260	island you lazy bunch of bone idle bastards survival
53260	60580	will be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height and harsh tropical storm season this
60580	69760	island either wants to decompose you or eat you alive they'll have to find their own water and
69760	77260	hunt for their own food with the finishing line in sight have these modern-day men got what it
77260	80320	takes to survive I'm gonna go to hell for this
83260	101200	five weeks ago 14 British men were dropped on a remote Pacific Island
101200	107140	they've had some success with their fishing nets
107140	113140	but not enough to stop their physical decline
113260	121000	we've been here over a month now we are starting to starve be careful taking huge risks and the
121000	128800	pursuit of food holy he's severed one of his tendons the group suffered their biggest loss
128800	135640	he needs to be evacuated as 36 year old Will was forced to leave the island
136780	143080	I feel devastated he's gone of all the people he wanted to finish with he was up there wasn't it we
143260	149080	didn't finish strong as the team and now the islands thwarted that I hate this place I hate it
163360	164200	we're in again
166600	167860	no respite for us man
168640	172600	thunder we're getting screwed again
173260	186400	fair weather Islanders what's going on here oh I've got a flippings as a scorpion right don't move

190660	194860	whoa let me get that way don't cut it off don't throw it off on your spot take it off take it off
197440	202780	give it a shot yeah ain't that the thing with this island one minute it's all calm and then
203260	219880	the men have been living on the island for an unprecedented 36 days and they're now entering
219880	226600	uncharted territory and that's why this time only the mentally strong are going to make it to the end
226600	227440	foreign
227440	238480	living for five weeks on an extreme low calorie diet consisting mainly of fish limpets and coconuts
238480	243820	the men have been getting weaker by the day pounds just keep dropping off gentlemen
244660	248940	to make sure their physical decline doesn't become life-threatening Dr
248940	254260	Piers has been monitoring their weight using scales from his medical kit come on you have a streak of
254260	256780	piss that puts me uh just under
257440	259200	Er, ten stone.
259240	261200	My bollocks weigh more than that.
261240	262240	Jesus.
265000	266520	28-inch waist.
266560	268920	28-inch waist.
268960	271080	Jesus Christ!
271120	273120	You could just buy boys clothes when you get home now.
273160	274680	If you have a flap suit, pack it.
274720	275720	Baby gap, mate.
275760	277680	You could baby gap.
277720	279400	Since arriving on the island,
279440	282440	the men have shed nearly 30 stone between them.
283760	285440	The weight loss was always going to be dramatic,
285440	287760	but I was not expecting it to be as severe as it was.
292080	294680	A maybe just maybe.
294720	298240	The storm has been kind and dropped us a fresh coconut.
298280	300160	Determined to halt the decline,
300200	303080	the men redouble their efforts to find food.
303120	305640	We're going to go and check the shit out of these nets.
305680	307840	Good luck, fellas.
307880	310920	Oh, my leg is just not working today.
310960	312680	I had that yesterday, just...
312720	314800	Have you worn your boots recently?
314840	315400	No.
315480	320040	Oh, God, dude, do not try putting them on, I tell you now.
320080	321360	Huh?
321400	324640	Oh, it's a bit weightier than last time, isn't it?
324680	327400	The fishing nets have been a lifeline for the men,
327440	328880	but as they get weaker,
328920	330640	taking the raft out to check them
330680	333520	has become an increasingly difficult task.
333560	336480	Come on, now, let's have just one or two.
336520	339360	Oh, bollocks.
339400	341320	Little snag.
341360	343080	Oh!
343120	344920	Oh, this is getting annoying now.
345440	347480	Today, there isn't a single fish
347520	350160	to reward Charlie and Piers for their efforts.
350200	351440	You all right?
351480	352800	I think it's dangerous now, actually,
352840	354760	moving these nets, in all honesty.
354800	356720	All of us are just skin and bone,
356760	361120	and it's not really...
361160	362480	I don't think it's safe any more.
369800	374160	We've eaten almost every single coconut on this whole island.
374200	375280	All the ones left are pretty much gone.
375280	376680	They're pretty much rotten.
378800	381040	This was the last little stash I knew about.
381080	385000	Depleted a lot of the limpet stores already, really.
386480	389400	Even the men's once-reliable food sources
389440	391840	appear to be running dry.
391880	393440	We have truly decimated the fish
393480	396920	within three metres of the boundary of this island, haven't we?
402120	404160	24 hours ago, we were...
405280	407840	..conquering this island.
407880	409960	Nets were full of fish.
410000	413320	24 hours later, we're in tatters.
413360	415360	This could go from bad to worse very easily.
418880	422760	Every single one of these guys is going to have mega low moments.
422800	425560	It's just the reality of being out in the wild,
425600	429320	being tired, being bitten to death, being hungry.
429360	431640	You just have those moments.
431680	434600	And one of the key lessons I've learned is that the pain,
434600	437560	the discomfort, it never lasts forever.
437600	438920	Keep your eyes on the light.
442960	444040	Can I just show you something?
444080	445720	There's something here that you might all want to see.
445760	446720	Where is it?
446760	447760	Come with me. It's not very far.
447800	448840	It's worth it, Sam.
448880	451160	Is it edible?
451200	452200	It's good.
452240	454240	I'm taking my knife, just in case.
454280	455360	It's Bear Grylls, isn't it?
455400	456680	And it's a hope as well.
456720	457960	Look at this.
458000	459080	Oh, yeah.
459120	460400	Oh, baby turtle.
460440	463480	It's alive and it's making its way to the beach.
463520	464240	And if there's one,
464240	466200	there's probably a few more.
466240	467200	Isn't that amazing?
467240	468400	That's incredible.
468440	469400	There's the others. Look.
469440	470680	Oh, the other one. Oh, yeah.
470720	472000	Can you see the two of them?
472040	472840	Yeah.
472880	473920	Oh.
473960	475040	It's gorgeous, isn't it?
475080	475920	Privilege.
475960	478720	It's a real privilege, isn't it?
478760	479760	I just noticed it.
479800	481920	I was coming back from the end of the beach.
481960	484280	I just saw this thing wriggling in the sand and I thought,
484320	485600	what's that?
485640	487600	And just to see that, it's absolutely amazing.
492080	493520	This is such fire.
493520	495920	You can sort of see them toasting in the sun, can't you?
495960	496920	Yeah.
498080	500120	It's the life and death of these guys, you know what I mean?
500160	502040	It's like each one of us, you know,
502080	504080	whether it's here on this island or in life,
504120	507520	we're sort of fighting our own personal battles.
507560	508560	Should we help him?
512160	515040	Come on, mate. Get out of that hole.
515080	516520	Help him along.
516560	518280	Come on, chap.
518320	519320	Go.
520720	522360	And maybe I'm doing a completely wrong thing
522400	523320	and...
523520	526880	Shoot me down, but if there's a chance of this little dude
526920	529680	living rather than dying,
529720	530720	I want him to live.
535440	536440	Go on, little fella.
536480	537480	Take to the water.
539320	542600	God, that was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.
542640	543680	Really touching.
543720	546080	Those guys have just been born, they've just been hatched.
546120	548000	All they're thinking about is just surviving.
548040	551360	Getting to that water, it just puts everything into perspective.
551400	553320	Such a beautiful sight.
553320	555920	This is what life is, really.
557320	558520	You OK?
558560	560000	Yeah, yeah, tired, that's all.
565480	568040	The turtles have been a welcome distraction,
568080	570520	but after more than five weeks on a starvation diet
570560	574440	and no sign of their next meal, the men are in bad shape.
574480	575400	God.
575440	576360	Tired.
578120	579560	Just tired.
580440	582520	I'm so tired, just tired.
583320	587160	I've usually got lots of energy, and I like being enthusiastic about things.
587240	588560	I like doing things.
589640	591240	But I've been so tired.
591320	595840	I'm sort of starving, wasting away, and I know my body is just like,
595920	599000	you need fuel, but there's no escaping it.
599080	602400	You're so aware that you're going downhill fast.
608000	609000	Are you all right?
610040	611040	No, he's gone, I think.
611040	612680	They're all fucking dying.
612760	617120	On the beach, some of the baby turtles are also on their last legs.
618360	621120	They're just frying up hot little bodies.
622160	623640	I wish they'd woken up at night.
625680	628680	It breaks my heart, but either we leave these little guys to rot
628760	631320	or for the birds to pick at them or we eat them.
631400	637600	And this, by any definition, is a moral dilemma.
637680	639800	Are we definitely boiling these little birds?
639880	640880	Yeah.
640880	641880	Little buggers up, are we?
641960	642960	What do you think?
643040	644040	I'm not eating it.
644120	645120	No?
645200	646200	I think it's disgusting.
646280	648840	I think you're all inhumane if you eat them, to be honest.
648920	653040	The turtle who died on the beach, there's rumours of that going in a broth,
653120	658240	and you could say for ethical reasons or whatever,
658320	661160	there's no way I'm drinking any of that at all.
664760	666200	I'm going to go to hell for this.
666280	669960	Despite strong feelings in the group, Sam makes a decision.
670040	670200	I'm going to go to hell for this.
670200	671200	I'm going to go to hell for this.
671280	672280	Eat, not eat.
672360	673400	I think we should eat them.
675720	677600	I think these guys are done.
677680	679120	Are they all right?
679200	682160	I've got a hard-boiled egg.
682240	684200	Hates Christ, they're beautiful, aren't they?
684280	686280	Oh, that's wrong.
686360	687640	That is so wrong.
690480	692560	I've eaten some fucked up shit in my time.
692640	694320	This takes a kick.
694400	696920	Salute, my little turtley friends.
697000	698320	Best shell in all?
698400	699440	Yep, every bit.
699440	700440	Raphael.
703040	705000	Michelangelo.
705080	706400	Is there anyone else claiming these turtles?
706480	708120	Go on, then. Don't be shy.
708200	710600	I'll have two.
710680	712200	Oh, my God, they're good.
712280	714360	They're absolutely stunning.
714440	716080	Are you eating them or not eating them?
716160	717560	I am not eating them, mate.
717640	718600	All right, OK.
718680	722920	Weird how you can feel nothing for a snake or an iguana,
723000	725000	and baby turtle has died anyway.
725080	726120	It's weird.
726200	728000	Difficult to eat.
728080	729240	But I scoffed them down.
729440	731080	It is quite delicious.
731160	735080	I'm sure it is, but a bizarre principle that I'm sticking to now.
735160	739520	With only half the group able to bring themselves to eat the baby turtles,
739600	742480	they bring little relief to the malnourished men.
742560	746080	It's becoming an experiment in starvation.
746160	750160	It's really tough to keep going when you're so hungry.
750240	753000	And the future looks pretty bleak when it comes to food.
754840	759000	The men have now been living alone on the island for more than five weeks.
759440	761440	It doesn't smell too good.
761520	762520	Oh!
762600	763600	Ah!
763680	764680	Fuck!
764760	765760	Ah!
765840	771680	Since the demise of their fishing nets, the food situation has become critical.
771760	775160	Resources on our back doorstep have run out.
775240	780160	A handful of dead baby turtles provided a temporary reprieve for some of the men.
782360	783360	Whoa!
783440	786360	But today they're back to nothing.
786440	789200	About a week ago, we saw a baby turtle.
789200	794040	We saw pig-trotter marks, and we're keen to lay some pig traps.
794120	796600	And hopefully, we'll be able to bring back the bacon.
798640	802520	When you're deprived of food, it literally becomes all-consuming.
802600	804000	It's all you think about.
804080	807120	It's all that motivates and drives you, I need something.
807200	809560	But hard though it is when they're running on empty,
809640	812880	the men can't afford to neglect the other survival essentials
812960	818200	they've worked so hard to maintain over five weeks, especially team spirit.
819200	821720	We're on of the most draneling Chuck Santiago brothers
821800	823120	Because I'm trying to find what they could get.
832000	833000	Come on, chefs.
833320	835360	That chap's is delicious.
836080	837800	Is that the obligatory pubic hair?
837880	840040	After an unsuccessful morning,
840120	844160	the only meal the hunting party have been able to muster is limpet broth,
844240	846560	which is quickly devoured by the men.
846640	847600	Mm.
847680	848600	MMM!
849200	851800	I think Phil's the biggest fool.
851800	853560	What have I missed?
853560	855360	The group's oldest member, Phil,
855360	858120	has arrived back in camp later than the others.
859720	862600	We all served up the food
862600	864480	and completely forgot about Phil.
867440	868840	What are you doing?
868840	870840	Is there any driveway?
870840	873000	That'd be a negative.
873000	876320	What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna hide behind my T-shirt.
876320	877160	Wow.
877160	879160	I know that he doesn't sit on it.
879160	881160	Does he need more than water now that he's...
883160	886200	It's the first time since the men arrived on the island
886200	888720	that they have forgotten to feed one of their own.
890200	892840	Everyone looked after themselves and forgot me.
892840	894520	Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
894520	896960	That's OK. It just means that you all owe me.
896960	897960	That's all.
902600	906160	So, we weren't acting like this four weeks into the experiment,
906160	907120	but now we are...
907120	908880	We're coming up to five and a half weeks
908880	914000	and a lot of people are starting to fray around the edges.
914000	915440	Some of them are fraying.
915440	918160	Some of them are coming away at the seams.
918160	919560	She didn't hear me.
919560	921280	What's he doing now?
921280	922760	I don't know.
922760	924520	He's wondering now.
924520	925720	I don't know.
925720	927200	Have you completely lost it?
927200	929040	I don't believe so.
929040	930240	I miss Phil.
937120	940800	OK, finally, let's get the fuck out of here.
940800	942120	That's it.
942120	943240	Enjoy.
943240	945440	We'll see you later on, mate.
945440	947120	Desperate for a decent meal
947120	950080	and having exhausted the resources close to camp,
950080	953680	Sam Brown and Kyle head off to look further afield.
953680	955960	Now we can go get some coconuts.
955960	957240	Fingers crossed.
957240	958440	For the first time,
958440	961800	they're heading to the unexplored south side of the island,
961800	966000	an arduous five-kilometre round trip across unforgiving terrain.
967120	969360	Having set off at 4pm,
969360	973000	they have just two hours to make it there and back before nightfall.
976360	978400	We might have left this slightly late.
981680	983360	Guys, there's an iguana here.
983360	984360	Where is it?
984360	986200	In the remaining hours of daylight,
986200	990000	the other men are doing their best to find a meal closer to home.
990000	991040	Where is it?
991040	993400	It's in the fucking tree here. I'm pointing to it.
993400	995200	We're in a fucking forest. It's twirling.
995200	996200	It's a tree.
996200	996800	It's a tree.
996800	999480	12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, where are you standing?
999480	1001000	Wow.
1001000	1002760	Fractures occurring in the group.
1002760	1005240	Wee arguments, bickering.
1005240	1007960	And that's got to be down to the hunger and the tiredness.
1007960	1009320	We haven't got a fucking clue where it is.
1009320	1011800	It's... I mean, can everyone see me?
1011800	1013520	If you can see me, I'm pointing at it.
1013520	1014400	Where is it?
1014400	1015920	It's down towards you, Barney. Barney, Barney.
1015920	1017000	It's going that way. It's going that way.
1017000	1018920	Yeah, I know. He's gone.
1018920	1020360	Back.
1020360	1021360	Bollocks.
1021360	1024040	MUSIC PLAYS
1024040	1025920	MUSIC FADES
1025920	1027200	So are you struggling a bit, today?
1027200	1029920	Yeah, today has been a tough day, actually.
1031040	1033640	Sam and Kyle have now been trekking through dense jungle
1033640	1036560	for more than an hour...
1036560	1039280	..in an attempt to find out if the island's south coast
1039280	1041680	has any untapped sources of food.
1041680	1044040	Slippy as buggery here, Kyle, just be careful.
1044040	1045360	Cheers, mate.
1045360	1048800	This is going to be a fucking nightmare on the way back.
1050160	1052600	Thanks for that beat, chocolate.
1052600	1054920	Mate, be careful. Be careful, be careful.
1054920	1055240	Be careful! Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful, mate!"
1055240	1056240	Be careful.
1062960	1064600	This is a no-go.
1064600	1068080	We were hoping to find a nice sandy beach and a coconut tree.
1070440	1071440	Instead...
1073840	1074840	..we find this.
1077640	1078760	Fucking lethal.
1080760	1082800	One slip up here and we'll die.
1085240	1086240	We'll die.
1092400	1094080	On the other side of the island,
1094080	1097040	farmer Charlie is the first to return to camp
1097040	1098840	after a fruitless day's hunting.
1100040	1101560	Oh, fucking hell!
1103840	1108520	I've come back to find the fire down to about one square inch of embers
1108520	1111320	after a month of constant burn.
1111320	1113920	We're getting a bit complacent now.
1113920	1114920	How much water's left?
1115240	1116240	I don't know.
1116240	1117240	Oh, no.
1122240	1125240	You can see the standards of the camp are going lower and lower
1125240	1128240	because people are just starting not to give a shit any more.
1130240	1132240	Kept this fire going for a month now.
1132240	1135240	There was no smoke coming out of that whatsoever.
1135240	1137240	There was an ember about an inch square.
1138240	1141240	But it was either, yeah, Barney, Phil, Roscoe...
1141240	1143240	That's not point fingers, it's not helpful.
1143240	1144480	..just saying it was either.
1144480	1145200	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1145240	1146240	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1146240	1147240	One of you five.
1147240	1149240	It cannot happen again.
1151240	1155240	Most of the group have now been back at camp for the past hour,
1155240	1158240	but Sam and Kyle have yet to return from their expedition
1158240	1160240	to the south of the island.
1160240	1162240	Are we worried about them, lads?
1162240	1164240	It's now pitch black.
1164240	1165240	It is, isn't it? Yeah.
1165240	1167240	It's not the ideal time to be out foraging.
1167240	1170240	My worry is, when you're in the middle of the jungle, in the dark...
1170240	1172240	Yeah, you've got no navigation.
1172240	1174240	You've got a high tide as well, so you can't even get round.
1175240	1178240	This is the first time any of the men have failed
1178240	1180240	to get back to camp before dark.
1183240	1185240	With the weather worsening
1185240	1188240	and concerns growing over Sam and Kyle's safety,
1188240	1191240	the men muster a search party.
1191240	1193240	Let's go. Let's try and find them.
1194240	1195240	Ideal.
1195240	1198240	Fucking sure we're going out at four o'clock.
1198240	1201240	Yeah, they're certainly not equipped for a night out
1201240	1203240	in the fucking jungle on their own.
1203240	1204240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1204240	1206240	It's a very steep drop down here.
1207240	1208240	Sam!
1210240	1211240	Kyle!
1214240	1215240	Sam!
1217240	1218240	Kyle!
1221240	1223240	It's not looking good, man.
1223240	1226240	They would not find us here. Not a chance.
1227240	1230240	This is Kyle and Sam in the dark,
1230240	1233240	trying to trek back towards our camp.
1234240	1236240	We'll see how far we get.
1237240	1240240	With no sun in the sky, it's hard to get your bearings.
1240240	1243240	Really, really unforgiving terrain.
1243240	1245240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1245240	1246240	Charlie!
1247240	1248240	Charlie!
1248240	1250240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1251240	1252240	Sam!
1253240	1254240	Try the bird.
1254240	1256240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1256240	1257240	Oh, fuck.
1257240	1259240	This is fucking stupid.
1259240	1261240	I feel tormented out here.
1261240	1262240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1262240	1263240	Come on, boys!
1263240	1264240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1264240	1265240	SAM!
1265240	1266240	Kyle!
1266240	1267240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1267240	1269240	Having searched for an hour with no sign of the missing pair,
1269240	1271240	the group reluctantly head back to camp.
1271240	1272240	WHISTLE BLOWS
1272240	1274240	Truth's known you want to get them and give them a clip
1274240	1276240	for being so stupid and putting us all through this
1276240	1278240	because the only thing they can do is have a look at the dog.
1278240	1279240	The dog is a dog.
1279240	1280240	Oh, my God.
1280240	1281240	Oh, my God.
1281240	1282240	Oh, my God.
1282240	1283240	Oh, my God.
1283240	1284240	Oh, my God.
1284240	1285240	Oh, my God.
1285240	1286240	Oh, my God.
1286240	1287240	Oh, my God.
1287240	1288240	Oh, my God.
1288240	1289240	Oh, my God.
1289240	1290240	Oh, my God.
1290240	1291240	Oh, my God.
1291240	1297800	because the only thing we are going to be thinking now all night is how they say how are they i hope
1297800	1302840	they're okay familiarization makes you think that we've got it licked yeah that's what we've done
1302840	1307320	we ain't got nothing licked have we not mother nature in this island and bite you whenever she
1307320	1322520	feels fit oh four rocks oh yeah desperately trying to get back to camp sam and kyle have
1322520	1327960	hit the treacherous stretch of coast where will had his accident this is getting dangerous
1328840	1331800	one wrong move here could easily prove fatal
1334600	1335880	now this next bit
1337720	1340120	you have to take it really really slow because
1340840	1344200	it's slippy as hell in the boulders and we've only got one head torch between us
1345640	1347960	i am genuinely shedding myself now
1360840	1362920	i genuinely don't think that they know where they are
1366040	1367240	it's a bit eerie actually
1367320	1371800	sometimes maybe i've seen one too many horror films i didn't think i was scared
1371800	1375960	of the dark but out here you have to sort of steal yourself that you're not scared of the dark
1378280	1381720	hello i see a light boys
1389720	1395240	sam good to see you man we are so pleased that you're back i don't think i've ever been so
1395800	1402840	massively relieved in my whole life well done boys glad to have you all well done boys
1402840	1410200	well done boys my pleasure the two prodigal sons returned thank god they're back home safe and sound
1410200	1415560	the other side of the island is just horrible it's all sheer cliff yeah the waves hitting it like
1416280	1421800	it's going to sit down sorry listen sorry to keep you guys up for so long anyone but we got back
1421800	1425160	that's what counts well the past few days have taken the whole island off its way into the sea
1425160	1429840	whole group really to their limits both physically and mentally not only have
1429840	1433680	they forgotten to feed people and neglected the essential tasks of fire
1433680	1438680	and water but their recklessness brought the group close to losing two more men
1438680	1443660	if they don't start looking after each other thinking smart being resourceful
1443660	1449040	and surviving then got a cat's chance the whole thing for me all comes down
1449040	1453840	to that's getting complacent yeah about everything thinking that we're we're now
1453840	1458080	starting to own this island a little bit when really we have shit we took
1458080	1463440	control that comes down to slipping off rocks running out of wood which will
1463440	1467500	blatantly do tomorrow yeah whatever it may be let's just get our drills a
1467500	1471480	little bit back in order yeah let's get back with morning morning calls and
1471480	1474280	stuff like that let's get back into them because we're all fucking show you the
1474280	1477940	minute so let's get the basics right yeah it would be vulgar to finish in
1477940	1483520	such a weak way we are here and we have grown so close together that we go for
1483520	1483600	it
1483840	1488640	doing the things we want to do that are exciting and fulfill all them things
1488640	1493020	we've always wanted to whip since being here let's go for it let's do this chaps
1493020	1499800	come on I don't want to finish week when I finish strong catch some pigs catch
1499800	1505200	some animals finish this adventure the way we want to I'm not going out like a
1505200	1509280	wet fart I want to go out strong
1512280	1513520	mum and dad
1513840	1525460	there's so much I want to tell you because I just wanted to say being here
1527960	1532900	has made me realize just how much I love you all
1533400	1538240	I don't want you to be worried about me in any sense and the reason I'm being
1538240	1543720	kind of a little bit nearly tearful it's because I just can't wait for the next
1543720	1545320	for that moment to see you all.
1549160	1550640	But I'm having the time of my life.
1550640	1551480	I really am.
1555000	1559160	I hope, I hope, it's off to a good go.
1559160	1563380	Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
1563380	1564340	Early morning.
1565280	1567720	After a difficult day yesterday,
1567720	1570500	the men are determined to redouble their efforts
1570500	1572420	and leave the island on a high.
1572420	1575420	I'm amazed what washes up on these damn beaches.
1575420	1576580	A snake.
1576580	1577680	Should I get a machete?
1578760	1579680	Nice shot.
1579680	1580600	Come on.
1580600	1581960	It's so funny, because on day one,
1581960	1584080	we would be like, oh shit, there's a snake.
1584080	1586540	And now we're like, oh, it's just another snake.
1586540	1587380	Roar!
1590800	1593420	Today, I really got a sense that our teamwork,
1593420	1595720	our team ethic really came back.
1597720	1601660	It just seems to be a real pulling together today.
1602420	1604080	Woo!
1604080	1605680	Man, he caught a whopper.
1605680	1607540	We've got fish!
1607540	1609380	Holy shit!
1611380	1612880	Hello, hello, hello.
1612880	1613720	Oh, what a night.
1613720	1614540	Oh, that is it.
1614540	1616920	It's a beauty as well.
1616920	1619800	Never in my life have I made my own sashimi before.
1621000	1625420	I've gone from eating one fish maybe every six months
1625420	1630180	to now having it raw on a beach, on a home-whittled table,
1630180	1631300	and loving it.
1631300	1632340	Dig in. To you, sir.
1632420	1634340	To many, to many more days like this.
1638960	1639800	Oh.
1640960	1642080	Mm.
1642080	1644840	That is just so...
1644840	1646420	Succulent in the justice, does it?
1646420	1647260	Fresh.
1648540	1649380	It's delicious.
1650620	1652420	One of the things I want to see in this experiment
1652420	1655720	is whether these guys can use all their collective resources
1655720	1658500	and brains and muscles to not just survive,
1658500	1661720	but to really thrive, to build community,
1661720	1667220	to have fun, to work out efficient sources of finding food,
1667220	1669720	to, you know, to really start to thrive
1669720	1672920	and separate us from the animals.
1672920	1675640	When Oinky makes his way to my front door,
1675640	1678720	I will consume the entire fucking animal.
1679600	1682640	The men's renewed spirit has brought fresh optimism
1682640	1685260	about the prospect of catching a meatier meal.
1687640	1688480	Ah.
1689420	1690600	What have we got here?
1691720	1694720	These look like little trotter mack's to me.
1694720	1696720	Oh, my fucking God.
1696720	1698720	That is exciting, isn't it?
1698720	1700720	We're going in the bushes, so, obviously,
1700720	1703720	it's a bit too hot for them, and then going back in.
1703720	1705720	They're definite pig trunks.
1705720	1707720	Please.
1707720	1709720	Oh, my God, bacon patties.
1709720	1711720	Oh!
1711720	1713720	We were all fantasising the other day
1713720	1715720	about what we're going to do to Oinky.
1715720	1717720	Delusions of grandeur, of smoking him,
1717720	1720720	and putting him on a spit, and having crackling, and...
1720720	1723720	God knows all sorts what we'd give for that.
1723720	1725720	Damn, it's warm, Barney.
1725720	1727720	It's getting hot, mate, isn't it, eh? Yeah.
1727720	1729720	Further down the beach,
1729720	1731720	Vik, Barney and the two Sams
1731720	1733720	are also on the hunt for a decent supper.
1735720	1737720	Shit the dog. Shit the dog.
1737720	1739720	What? Look at that. Look at that.
1739720	1741720	There's something there. Stop, stop, stop. Don't move.
1741720	1743720	Where, where, where? OK, stop.
1743720	1745720	Black pig, black pig. There's a pig in there. No way.
1745720	1747720	Don't move, don't move. Vik, Vik, don't move.
1747720	1749720	Let's have a think about this. OK.
1749720	1751720	He was just having a little snooze in the shade,
1751720	1753720	so we need to get behind him,
1753720	1755720	cos he's going to disappear straight in there.
1755720	1757720	I'll go up the sand. I'll go with you, then, yeah? Yeah.
1757720	1759720	Don't you worry. We'll hold him down.
1759720	1761720	If I'm eating pig tonight, I'll fight the bastards.
1761720	1763720	Just keep very calm.
1763720	1767720	When cornered, pigs can be incredibly aggressive animals.
1767720	1769720	This thing is going to run like stink.
1771720	1775720	They've got razor-sharp tusks and a vicious bite.
1779720	1782720	I'll go up to him and then...
1804720	1805720	There's a pig.
1805720	1807720	There's an other pig.
1807720	1809720	No!
1809720	1812120	Get in!
1812160	1815040	Holy shit, Barney! Sorry, Barney!
1815080	1817280	Woo!
1817320	1818520	Woo!
1818560	1820680	I thought he was going to turn and bite me. I crapped myself.
1822560	1824320	Yeah, he's gone.
1824360	1825880	Gosh, that was so much quicker than I thought.
1825920	1828000	That was just like...
1828040	1830080	Listen, it's done. This is how we roll.
1831720	1833840	I wasn't expecting you to stab him.
1833880	1835760	I didn't expect you to stab him at all.
1835800	1838040	I did. Mate, that would kill you.
1838040	1840520	That would hurt. That would fuck you up.
1840560	1841840	Yeah.
1841880	1843560	This is a fucking adult pig.
1843600	1844880	This is like a hog, isn't it?
1844920	1846240	These things wreck people.
1846280	1848000	Jesus, look at that tusk.
1848040	1849760	That would go through to bone, wouldn't it?
1849800	1851000	Oh, yeah.
1851040	1853920	Six weeks ago, I would have been very slow to draw a knife
1853960	1855600	and ram it into a large mammal's throat.
1855640	1858440	Now, I didn't even think, I didn't even hesitate.
1858480	1860160	Oh, easy peasy.
1860200	1861560	OK. Yeah.
1862720	1864960	Oh, there's going to be so much meat on that head.
1865000	1866680	In 21st century Britain,
1866720	1867960	I think we're so used to getting
1867960	1871680	all of our meat pre-packaged off a supermarket shelf.
1871720	1874040	And in many ways, we've kind of lost touch
1874080	1875680	with actually where it comes from.
1875720	1880480	Meat on his legs, ribs, back legs, a lot.
1880520	1884040	Many people understand we find the whole idea of killing an animal,
1884080	1886920	they find it either cruel or definitely upsetting.
1886960	1888960	And, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,
1889000	1892200	but in a survival situation, when it comes down to it,
1892240	1893640	it's a simple choice.
1893680	1895200	Them or you.
1896280	1897280	Nose to tail,
1897280	1899960	we're going to eat every piece of you, Mr Pig.
1900000	1901720	I can see home from here, boys.
1901760	1903560	I don't believe it.
1903600	1906400	I don't believe it. It cannot be a trotter.
1906440	1907400	Woo!
1907440	1908720	Boys!
1908760	1910720	Ain't done this thing, eh?
1912600	1913840	Yes.
1913880	1915320	Well done, boys.
1915360	1916880	OK, three, two, one, go.
1918480	1920200	Oh, Mr Piggy.
1920240	1922240	That was hard work.
1922280	1923280	Yeah?
1923320	1926120	And you've already got me big, good in there.
1926160	1927080	Oh, that is great.
1927080	1928640	Absolutely brilliant, isn't it?
1928680	1930000	Yeah, get in there.
1930040	1934840	A pig of this size, weighing up to 200 pounds,
1934880	1937600	contains tens of thousands of calories
1937640	1940520	and could feed the ten men for the next few days.
1941800	1943960	I think there's a lung there.
1944000	1946320	Yeah, you don't want to eat lung.
1946360	1948600	Oh, we're going to have pork belly.
1948640	1950480	God, that is like barbecue food.
1950520	1952200	Yeah.
1952240	1955400	Has anybody got any preference about who's served first today?
1955440	1956880	I would say Phil.
1956880	1958600	Yeah, great job, good luck.
1958640	1961840	After the group forgot to feed Phil yesterday,
1961880	1966320	by way of an apology, they give him first dibs on the spoils.
1966360	1968040	I'm having a meat orgasm.
1970720	1971960	Which one's the kidney?
1972000	1975800	Anyone that knows me will know one of my favourite meals is liver and bacon.
1975840	1977000	Guess what that is?
1982040	1983040	Liver.
1983920	1985200	Oh.
1985200	1989240	And then to add to that, kidney.
1994680	1999560	That beats any crocodile, any fish, anything I've had on this island.
1999600	2002120	I don't know what you're saying.
2002160	2005280	The pig is the men's first taste of meat in weeks
2005320	2008080	and nothing is going to waste.
2008120	2009680	I think that's testicle-y.
2011360	2013840	I'm going to eat everything of this pig.
2013880	2015040	I'm even going to eat it.
2015040	2017160	It's little Willy.
2017200	2019760	I'd eat some pig penis.
2019800	2021480	That's a very unique flavour in there.
2021520	2022840	Does that taste like dick?
2022880	2025560	Yeah. Yeah, it is dick.
2025600	2029240	It worries me quite a lot that you know what dicks taste like.
2034480	2035880	Vic! Yeah?
2035920	2037480	I think we're raising the sign, mate.
2039520	2042520	After surviving on the island for almost six weeks,
2042560	2044560	the men have decided to make a tribute
2044560	2046000	to their achievement.
2046040	2049640	Gentlemen, by the power invested in me,
2049680	2054640	I name this camp the Croc and Trotter.
2054680	2056120	The Croc and Trotter!
2064120	2066080	I'm really looking forward to this ending
2066120	2068000	and looking back and just saying,
2068040	2070040	wow, I did that.
2072000	2073080	I accomplished...
2074560	2077560	I succeeded.
2077600	2080240	We conquered the island.
2080280	2083120	We're named and ready to rock.
2086120	2087840	Shall we play toss the caber?
2087880	2088960	Yeah!
2089000	2090520	First game, let's go.
2090560	2094160	Three, a two, a one, toss my caber.
2094200	2095960	Come on, Charlie.
2096000	2097480	Man!
2097520	2100040	Oh, no!
2100080	2101600	That's it!
2101640	2102680	Go!
2102720	2103640	Yay!
2103680	2104360	One!
2104360	2105360	Not bad, son!
2105400	2106360	Not bad!
2106400	2107360	Yeah!
2107400	2109280	It's the first time that the whole group,
2109320	2110680	as we let our hair down,
2110720	2113440	are not worried about water or wood or survival
2113480	2115120	or will we eat or will we not.
2115160	2118400	It's kind of like, let's just get together as lads and have fun.
2118440	2121880	I wish, looking back, I wish we'd done more of it.
2121920	2124400	That's one of the highlights of our entire time here.
2124440	2125480	Oh!
2125520	2126480	Beautiful!
2126520	2127480	Go, go, go, go, Vic!
2127520	2128480	No, Charlie!
2128520	2129480	Oh, no!
2129520	2130480	Oh, no, no!
2130520	2131480	Oh, no!
2131520	2132480	Oh, yes!
2132520	2133480	One nil!
2133520	2134160	Yes!
2134160	2136440	What I have experienced many times in the wild
2136480	2138560	is an incredible sense of achievement
2138600	2141160	that is very hard to get in everyday life.
2141200	2142200	Catch it!
2142240	2143320	Oh!
2143360	2146600	And I think when you battle for seven or eight hours
2146640	2150280	in a torrential rainstorm with just a couple of sticks to make a fire,
2150320	2154200	you've got to look for opportunities, however small, to have fun.
2154240	2155600	Yeah!
2155640	2159720	It's almost like nourishment, but for the soul.
2159760	2160560	Take the string!
2160600	2162200	Take the string!
2162240	2163200	Yes!
2164160	2165520	Call it a draw!
2165560	2166520	A draw, yeah!
2166560	2167560	A draw!
2167600	2170320	I feel amazing.
2172560	2174560	I feel relaxed, I feel empowered,
2174600	2179120	I feel like we're masters of this island.
2182680	2183840	I'll treasure this moment.
2183880	2185080	I really, really will.
2187800	2189760	This is what the island's all about.
2189800	2192080	This and a handful of other moments.
2192120	2193040	This feeling.
2193080	2193480	I hope we'll get to see it.
2193480	2195480	I hope I never forget it.
2197480	2199480	Well, here we are.
2199480	2204480	We are at the end of this magnificent, magnificent journey.
2204480	2208480	Overwhelming sadness that I miss my wife and kids so much.
2208480	2210480	Not so much sadness, just,
2210480	2213480	God, how long can this truly go on for?
2213480	2215480	Er...
2216480	2220480	Yeah, I'd like to see them soon, if possible.
2220480	2223480	Some of it better for me, some of it better.
2230480	2232480	What do you think of that beauty?
2232480	2234480	Shit. There it goes.
2234480	2235480	Look, look, look.
2235480	2238480	Ooh, there's some heat off this bad boy.
2238480	2240480	Look at this!
2240480	2242480	Look at that goal!
2242480	2244480	Didn't take long, did it?
2244480	2246480	Ocean's Elevenses.
2246480	2249480	This is our last night on the island.
2249480	2250480	Yeah!
2250480	2251480	Yes!
2251480	2252480	Yes!
2252480	2253480	Yes!
2253480	2254480	Yes!
2254480	2255480	Yes!
2255480	2256480	Good!
2256480	2258480	Best night so far?
2258480	2259480	I think so.
2259480	2261480	Has to be, doesn't it?
2261480	2262480	Awesome.
2262480	2263480	Love it.
2263480	2265480	Home's within spitting distance.
2265480	2267480	Really enjoying it.
2267480	2269480	Everyone's spirits are really high.
2269480	2270480	Wow.
2271480	2275480	The men have now survived on the island for 40 days.
2275480	2278480	Would you guys like to hear a little Ravi Varan's poem that I wrote this morning?
2278480	2279480	I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.
2279480	2281480	I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.
2281480	2282480	Yes, I'd love to.
2282480	2290480	Dear islands, our islands, this new family does hail.
2290480	2295480	As you've chucked every last, but nobody has failed.
2295480	2299480	On the contrary, dear islands, as our stay grew longer,
2299480	2301480	we may have reduced in numbers.
2301480	2302480	Holy shit!
2302480	2306480	But we've grown ever stronger.
2306480	2308480	For six long weeks,
2308480	2311480	we've battled hunger, tides, exhaustion, the weather.
2312480	2314480	But with British Bulldog spirit,
2314480	2316480	She floats!
2316480	2319480	we triumphed with heart, soul and endeavour.
2321480	2322480	Holy shit!
2322480	2327480	You've been cruel, uncomfortable and brutal to us all.
2328480	2332480	With freezing rain, dangerous seas and rocks that make us fall.
2332480	2333480	Holy shit!
2333480	2337480	You have dangerous beasts that can kill, maim and maul.
2339480	2340480	This is a scorpion.
2340480	2344480	But we baited, trapped, killed, cooked and ate them all.
2344480	2346480	Oh, delicious. So good.
2347480	2352480	But dear islands, our islands, we will never forget
2352480	2357480	the incredible journey we've shared since our new family met.
2358480	2362480	So the question is, our islands, can British blokes survive?
2362480	2364480	Get the fucking camera off!
2364480	2367480	The answer is no, dear islands.
2368480	2371480	We didn't just survive, but thrive.
2371480	2372480	Excellent.
2381480	2383480	Oh, my God, look at her go!
2383480	2384480	Wow!
2398480	2404480	So I'm on my way to pick up the men after six weeks, you know,
2404480	2407480	and to be honest, I'm pretty nervous just about what I'm going to find.
2407480	2410480	You know, are they going to be emaciated wrecks
2410480	2412480	or are they going to look pretty healthy?
2412480	2414480	You know, are they going to be broken men
2414480	2417480	or will they have figured out how to survive and thrive?
2419480	2420480	It is quite strange, though, isn't it?
2420480	2421480	What bit?
2421480	2422480	It's finished.
2422480	2423480	Yeah, yeah.
2423480	2427480	Within an hour, we'll step off and never be able to get out.
2427480	2430480	We'll step off and never, ever step back on.
2430480	2432480	For it has been an honour serving you, gentlemen.
2432480	2433480	Yes, see you here.
2433480	2434480	Good effort, gents.
2434480	2437480	I feel quite proud of our little gang.
2437480	2441480	The island has taught me an incredible sense of unity
2441480	2445480	and we've shared, we've shared everything that we've had here on this island.
2445480	2447480	It doesn't matter if it was the smallest fish,
2447480	2449480	we've shared it between everyone.
2450480	2451480	I feel...
2454480	2456480	..thrilled to have made it this far
2456480	2458480	with you all.
2458480	2460480	It sounds fucked up,
2460480	2463480	but I feel like I'm going to actually miss you lot.
2463480	2468480	I think I'm leaving the island with a renewed sense of confidence
2468480	2470480	and some friends.
2471480	2473480	Some more friends, should I say.
2475480	2476480	Here we go, boys.
2476480	2477480	Don't worry.
2477480	2478480	Here he is.
2479480	2480480	Yes!
2480480	2481480	Come on, lads.
2482480	2483480	This is our man.
2483480	2484480	This is it, lads.
2485480	2486480	It's Bear Grylls.
2486480	2487480	Very good, lads.
2487480	2488480	It's only Bear Bloody Grylls.
2488480	2489480	It's only Bloody Dunnets.
2489480	2491480	It's only Bloody Dunnets!
2493480	2494480	Bloody Dunnets!
2498480	2499480	Wow.
2499480	2500480	Look at you guys.
2500480	2501480	I thought I smelled bad.
2502480	2504480	I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work.
2504480	2506480	Yeah, glad to see you.
2506480	2507480	Thanks for coming back.
2507480	2509480	I'm glad I made it to the end.
2509480	2513480	I am super, super, super glad I made it to the end.
2513480	2514480	Well done, you guys.
2514480	2515480	Wow.
2515480	2517480	It's like you've been through a war zone.
2517480	2519480	But those smiles tell a story.
2520480	2521480	So how are you feeling?
2521480	2522480	Fantastic.
2522480	2523480	Glad to see you now.
2523480	2524480	Yeah.
2524480	2525480	Glad to see you.
2526480	2531480	As a band of brothers, it's not a band of brothers anymore.
2531480	2532480	It's a family.
2532480	2534480	Love them and hate them.
2534480	2536480	They're here forever with you.
2536480	2538480	And it was fantastic.
2538480	2540480	So we're going to get you off the island.
2540480	2541480	One last thing you guys want to do?
2541480	2542480	Yes.
2542480	2543480	Woo!
2543480	2544480	Come on, boys.
2544480	2545480	Come on, guys.
2545480	2547480	Kyle, you started this fire.
2547480	2549480	You tell us when to end it, pal.
2549480	2552480	I'm proud to say that I've made it here with you guys.
2552480	2553480	Ocean's 11ters.
2553480	2555480	Let's quench the fire.
2555480	2556480	Quench the fire, guys.
2556480	2558480	Woo!
2558480	2560480	Woo!
2560480	2561480	Woo!
2561480	2562480	Woo!
2562480	2563480	Woo!
2563480	2564480	Woo!
2564480	2565480	Woo!
2565480	2566480	Woo!
2566480	2567480	Woo!
2567480	2568480	Woo!
2568480	2569480	Woo!
2569480	2570480	Woo!
2570480	2571480	Woo!
2571480	2572480	Woo!
2572480	2573480	Woo!
2573480	2574480	Woo!
2574480	2575480	Woo!

2589480	2590480	Get in there.
2590480	2591480	Yes?
2591480	2592480	I think what's interesting is that you realize they've actually
2592480	2593480	become a really tight unit.
2593480	2595480	You know, that's why there's emotion at the end when they're
2595480	2597480	hugging each other, because they've been through the fire
2597480	2599480	together, and have come out of it stronger.
2599480	2600480	Well done, boys.
2600480	2601480	Let's go, boys.
2601480	2602480	Let's go, boys.
2602480	2611820	If I got that chance again, give me about a year or half a year, I'll do it again.
2612240	2615240	But if you ask me to do it tomorrow, I'll probably tell you to piss off.
2626040	2630860	Just because you're over 40, just because you're over 50, just because you're almost 60, doesn't mean you're spent.
2632480	2635380	A can-do attitude goes a long way in this life.
2652080	2653780	Is that Will? Is that Will?
2654280	2654940	That's William!
2659940	2661300	That's him in this!
2662480	2674160	Oh, that's so good.
2674160	2675280	Wow, you all stink!
2678100	2680780	I couldn't let you guys get to the end without me.
2688160	2689160	Hello, is that you?
2692480	2694900	Hi, I'm fine, you?
2699020	2700660	It's absolutely brilliant, babe.
2701020	2702540	Oh God, your voice is beautiful.
2704640	2705200	Hello?
2705600	2705840	Hello?
2707680	2708240	Hello?
2713240	2714460	Is that Bobby?
2715200	2715800	Yeah.
2717480	2718740	Oh, Bobby!
2718740	2721400	Bobby, I need to hear from you.
2722480	2724040	It'sông
2724040	2733320	It's provided a look at overall.
2733320	2738220	You know, they've built community, they have learnt have compassionate and a care for each other.
2738220	2740880	A respect for each other, they've worked their nuts off.
2740880	2743880	They've understood the heart of survival isn't about knowledge.
2743880	2746720	It's about embracing failure, making mistakes and never giving up.
2746720	2749900	And that's why, at the end of it, what I've done is inspiring.
2752480	2757360	they've gone through a journey together and come out of it stronger tighter and
2757360	2763300	it's why they've learned the beginning of a mastery over this environment
2763300	2768580	they can call themselves survivors they've earned it the hard way
