0	15000	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one is inhabited by 14 British
15000	25620	men while a separate island is home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be utterly alone with
25620	33500	only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything themselves
33500	43860	when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the
43860	54900	Windsor day who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island
55620	69180	survival will be harder than ever the search for water and hunt for food is now a matter of life or
69180	81840	death living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season when pitted against the
81840	85600	extremes of nature and the
85600	91960	these Monday women got what it takes to survive your bodies are just starting to fail I'm right on
91960	96280	the brink of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons over
100240	102220	foreign
109600	115240	get the knife get the knife first 10 women remain of the 14 I dropped off
115600	120940	on the remote Pacific Island you are not leaving this island I don't care if I have to carry you on
120940	125860	my back as they approach the four-week mark they're entering a new and potentially dangerous
125860	131200	phase of the experiment I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny without
131200	137080	enough food and water their bodies could be in serious danger of shutting down I think it's
137080	142660	about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal yesterday the women finally managed to
142660	144220	trap their first big prey
145600	154560	and ate their biggest meal yet anybody watches this in judges any of the girls here for what they've done today they can fuck all
154560	160740	it's day 26
160740	163620	oh
163620	166360	what's that it's moving
166360	170600	i knew there was things here that tried to burrow into your skin
170600	175240	don't worry about hurting me just get it out
175600	179600	The plague of parasites from yesterday's pig carcass has hit camp.
179600	181600	Basically, camp is in festivities.
181600	183600	Oh, Christ.
183600	187600	Let's wash down and we'll basically give each other a visual check.
187600	191600	Who says we don't have to take our clothes off to have a good time?
191600	193600	Hello!
193600	195600	She looks a bit angry.
195600	197600	She was angry a bit, didn't she?
197600	200600	Turns out I've had a tick right on my bum.
200600	202600	It's made a right mess.
202600	205600	I've got one there a bit. It's got its head in there.
205600	210600	These blood-sucking insects burrow their heads deep under the skin to feed,
210600	214600	exposing the women to a host of dangerous tropical diseases.
214600	217600	And as I went like that with my fingernail,
217600	223600	the arse ends of this tick came up with its legs moving.
223600	228600	Well, I've... Oh, God, it knocked me sick.
231600	232600	Two, three.
232600	233600	OK.
235600	237600	I think it's piggies' revenge.
240600	242600	Despite their recent pig kill,
242600	245600	the women now have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet
245600	248600	with very little water for the past four weeks.
248600	250600	From here, there's barely any research
250600	253600	about the effects of extreme survival on the body.
253600	257600	And because of this, they're now entering dangerous medical territory.
257600	261600	Without an adequate and constant supply of food and water,
261600	264600	they're going to risk long-term damage to their vital organs,
264600	266600	and they don't want that.
267600	269600	Like that?
269600	271600	Yeah. It caught the pig.
271600	274600	We cooked it as well, and now we're staying up all night
274600	278600	to preserve it in salt water from the sea
278600	282600	so that everybody can eat meat for the next three days.
282600	285600	Hunters Lauren and Beth, along with Havilah and Becky,
285600	290600	are working through the night to ensure they make the most of yesterday's pig kill.
291600	293600	Hey, that's island life.
293600	296600	While they're doing that, we are going to dig a hole in the ground
296600	298600	to bury the jerrycan.
298600	303600	So it's going to be a bit like a fridge, but a fridge for, like, cavemen.
303600	306600	With temperatures in excess of 30 degrees,
306600	309600	the coolest place to store the meat is underground.
309600	312600	Let's get it as deep as we can.
312600	315600	To do this, Lauren and Beth have requisitioned
315600	317600	one of the women's two jerrycans,
317600	320600	which, up to this point, has been used to filter, boil,
320600	322600	and store their drinking water.
322600	325600	Um, I'm kind of not happy about that.
325600	330600	Which is a cause of concern for lifelong vegetarian Jamie.
330600	332600	I know it's quite a big deal,
332600	337600	but it's also quite a big deal for me drinking water.
337600	339600	There's no way I'm drinking out of that.
339600	341600	It's got to be done.
341600	343600	People must be fed.
350600	358600	I'm a bit devastated about still being awake at this time in the morning.
358600	362600	This is not the same as tottering in at 5am on a pair of heels,
362600	364600	really, really drunk.
364600	366600	Having worked through the night,
366600	371600	the pig preservers head back to camp with the jerrycan filled with pork.
371600	374600	I think people have their priorities wrong.
374600	379600	I'm not saying that they shouldn't have done that to preserve the pig,
379600	383600	because I also didn't want the pig to go to waste.
383600	387600	I mean, I know I'm a vegetarian, so it's easy for me to say,
387600	392600	but it's almost like that was prioritised over our water,
392600	394600	and that's what I'm pissed off about.
394600	396600	OK, we're just going to cover this valve,
396600	399600	because we don't want any little nasties.
400600	402600	On the island, Jamie's helped establish
402600	405600	a successful water purification system,
405600	407600	using one jerrycan for filtering
407600	409600	and the other jerrycan for cleaning.
409600	412600	The jerrycan is a kettle for boiling.
412600	414600	It's fucked up the whole water system.
414600	416600	I've been sitting there for days doing it.
416600	418600	One jerrycan, get it on the boil.
418600	422600	Filter in the other jerrycan, get that on the boil.
422600	425600	And even then, we're struggling with the water.
425600	428600	Now we've got one shitty jerrycan without a lid.
428600	430600	So now I'm suffering.
431600	432600	Midday.
432600	436600	With tonight's dinner stored in their makeshift fridge,
436600	438600	the women who stayed up preserving the pig
438600	440600	are resting on the beach.
440600	442600	You smell so clean.
442600	443600	No, I don't.
443600	445600	I'm sniffing you.
446600	448600	55-year-old Julie is hard at work,
448600	451600	determined to supplement the women's dinner.
451600	453600	She's spotted a dead fish.
454600	456600	What I'm going to do is...
458600	462600	..I'm going to tie this up and tie it to my ankle
462600	464600	and see if anything else comes to eat it
464600	466600	that I can scoop up in my kiddie net.
466600	467600	What a lacking talent.
467600	469600	I make up for in enthusiasm.
469600	471600	My mum used to say that.
471600	473600	Oh, Julie.
475600	477600	8.62 altogether.
477600	479600	I'm single, divorced.
479600	480600	I've bought the house.
480600	483600	This is my second house that I've bought.
483600	486600	And I've done it all on my own.
486600	487600	I think I'm hard-working.
487600	490600	Once I start, I'll really give it, you know,
490600	492600	till I'm absolutely dropping.
492600	496600	It's like I'm behind myself with a big stick all the time.
496600	498600	I don't give myself a break.
499600	500600	Just be careful.
500600	502600	I don't want a shark taking your leg off.
503600	506600	This is the strangest fishing I've ever seen.
508600	509600	Julie is killing me.
509600	512600	I absolutely love her.
513600	516600	I'll keep throwing it out like a distressed fish.
518600	520600	I don't know anything about fishing.
520600	523600	I could be a couple of hours.
524600	525600	I'll give you the show.
525600	527600	I'll give you the show.
527600	529600	Oh, Julie.
529600	530600	Further down the beach...
530600	532600	Give me a really good chunk towards you.
532600	534600	..Jamie's made a discovery
534600	536600	that could make her water more palatable.
536600	539600	That is lime leaves, isn't it? Yeah.
539600	542600	I've been picking heaps and heaps of these lime leaves
542600	544600	and putting it in this boiled water.
544600	548600	It just takes away some of that rotten taste.
550600	552600	Totally tropical taste.
552600	553600	No.
553600	554600	LAUGHTER
555600	559600	I'm fucking determined we're going to get something out of this ocean.
560600	563600	On the shoreline, Julie is still hard at it.
565600	567600	No, she didn't!
570600	572600	Yeah! Go, Julie!
572600	573600	Wow.
575600	577600	No, she just lost it!
577600	579600	Fish fell back in the water.
579600	582600	I just fucking despair, I do, honest to God.
585600	588600	2pm. Julie is still fishing.
588600	591600	Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?
591600	592600	No.
592600	595600	I don't think any fish could have gone here.
595600	597600	LAUGHTER
597600	600600	Whilst the rest of the women are more interested in sunbathing
600600	602600	and relaxing on the beach.
602600	604600	Oh!
604600	606600	This is why we came here.
606600	609600	This bay is an absolute dream, isn't it?
609600	611600	Woo!
611600	613600	Exhausted!
613600	617600	Beth and Lauren wake to discover none of the other women have done any work.
617600	619600	We've dayed up, we cooked breakfast for everybody,
619600	621600	we cooked supper for everybody,
621600	623600	and then we needed kind of a little bit of a break today,
623600	626600	and because we've had a break, everybody else has had a fucking break,
626600	627600	and nothing's happened.
627600	629600	Do you know what?
629600	634600	Sometimes I find this island sends me round the fucking bend.
634600	636600	Everyone was agreeing, you know,
636600	639600	you guys need to have a bit more of a chill day.
639600	642600	Well, everyone seems to have taken that as everybody's going to have a relaxing day.
642600	644600	So we're back at 4 o'clock in the evening.
644600	646600	There's no wood for the fire.
646600	649600	Just feel like everyone's taking the piss, really.
649600	651600	So infuriating.
651600	655600	I mean, in a minute, Lauren and I are going to start cooking again.
655600	658600	On the preserved meat, and I guarantee you,
658600	660600	people that have been doing fuck-all all day
660600	662600	are going to be sitting front row and going,
662600	665600	all yum-yum-yum, eating all the big bits.
665600	669600	And that is just winding my fucking bobbin up.
669600	671600	MUSIC PLAYS
672600	674600	Oh, my God.
674600	676600	Mmm, that smells funky, doesn't it?
676600	680600	Lauren and Beth have dug up the jerrycan of preserved meat.
680600	684600	I mean, that jerrycan does smell of fucking vomit, though, doesn't it?
684600	686600	I think it's borderline.
686600	688600	It goes off very quickly, doesn't it?
688600	691600	With no other food collected during the day,
691600	694600	the women risk eating the suspect pork.
694600	697600	Come and grab a coconut bowl and fill up.
697600	698600	What do you think, girls?
698600	700600	I think it's going to be good.
700600	701600	It's going to be good.
701600	703600	What do you think, girls?
703600	704600	Mmm.
704600	706600	It doesn't taste right, does it?
706600	708600	It makes you feel a bit ill.
708600	710600	It is absolutely disgusting.
710600	712600	Like, it tastes gross.
712600	714600	It's disgusting.
714600	717600	But, you know, when it's the only thing you've got to eat...
717600	719600	The pork may have been foul,
719600	723600	but at least Jamie's flavoured lime water has hit the spot.
723600	725600	Oh, my God, Jamie, it's so good.
725600	727600	Oh, my God, it's amazing.
727600	729600	That was really exciting.
729600	731600	It's the best thing ever. Oh!
731600	735600	That's almost better than cunnilingus.
735600	737600	I don't like them being down there.
737600	739600	What?
739600	741600	I get scared.
741600	744600	I don't... Like, what the fuck are they doing?
744600	746600	And their little beady eyes.
748600	750600	Don't like it. Don't like it at all.
750600	752600	I'm like, get up, get up!
752600	754600	Oh, my God.
761600	765600	Excuse the farting.
765600	767600	What's that fucking smell?
767600	769600	I know, it's awful.
769600	772600	Last night, the women ate the rancid preserved pork,
772600	774600	but it's backfired on them this morning.
774600	776600	God, that was awful.
776600	778600	I'm going to have to go.
778600	780600	Oh, no, you're not going to be safe, are you?
780600	782600	I don't know. I don't feel very well.
782600	784600	Sorry!
784600	787600	I'm basically shitting myself,
787600	789600	and I've no idea when it's going to happen,
789600	791600	and I have 30 seconds to go.
794600	798600	Basically, then what happens is that you have explosive water,
798600	800600	diarrhoea coming out of you.
801600	803600	Twice now I haven't been able to make it,
803600	808600	and I've had to bring back, like, my soiled pants and wash them.
808600	811600	Harvey, can you take this... I'll take the head.
811600	813600	Can you take the white thing for me?
813600	815600	With the preserved pork no longer edible,
815600	817600	the women remove the pig's remains
817600	819600	and jerrycan a pewter.
819600	821600	This is the first time they've taken the jerrycan
821600	823600	and the pitted meat from the camp.
823600	825600	It's rancid.
825600	827600	Is the head in here?
827600	829600	Rotting head.
829600	831600	Fucking tick!
831600	833600	I think we just ditched all of this shit.
833600	835600	Yeah, none of it's moving back.
835600	837600	We don't need that canister, we don't need any of this.
837600	839600	I don't need this in my life right now!
839600	842600	Unconvinced they could salvage a rancid jerrycan
842600	845600	and use it to purify the water again,
845600	847600	the women throw it away.
847600	848600	Oh, sorry.
848600	849600	I'm coming out.
849600	852600	I've learned from experience that big disasters
852600	855600	are often made up of quite small mistakes,
855600	857600	but they have consequences,
857600	859600	and it sets off like a chain reaction,
859600	862600	and that chain can be very hard to break.
862600	865600	Now, with only one jerrycan to produce all their water,
865600	870600	the women are unknowingly heading towards a dehydration crisis.
870600	873600	We've lost half our buckets and half our containers now.
873600	875600	But we'll find more buckets and containers.
875600	877600	We couldn't possibly have brought those back.
877600	880600	I mean, they were just a rack.
880600	884600	In one stroke, the women have halved the amount of drinking water
884600	887600	they can produce and have permanently disrupted
887600	889600	their purification system.
889600	892600	Vegetarian Jamie is unimpressed.
892600	893600	I'm not happy.
893600	897600	That's how much water I've got left.
897600	901600	I had that in this morning, so that's all I've drank today.
901600	904600	I'm pissed off at the fucking situation.
904600	906600	And I think I've got PNT.
906600	908600	Uh-oh.
908600	910600	Yeah.
910600	912600	Four weeks in,
912600	915600	and the women are entering uncharted survival territory.
915600	917600	It's fucking hard.
917600	919600	Like, it's not a joke. It's really hard.
919600	921600	And I miss everybody.
921600	923600	I miss my family so much,
923600	927600	and I miss my boyfriend so much and my best friend so much,
927600	931600	and all I want to do is, you know, have something substantial to eat
931600	935600	or have some water that doesn't taste like the bottom of a swamp.
935600	939600	But I just keep telling myself I have to keep pushing on.
941600	945600	The women have unwittingly put themselves at risk of dehydration
945600	948600	after discarding a contaminated jerry can.
948600	952600	It means they can now only boil and purify half the amount of drinking water.
952600	954600	When that happened yesterday, I was like...
954600	955600	Yeah.
955600	956600	She lost it.
956600	958600	Don't ask for much, do you?
958600	959600	Coconut's a problem.
959600	960600	Exactly.
960600	964600	Jamie is furious with the other women and decides to take drastic action.
965600	967600	I'm really annoyed, actually.
967600	969600	I'm going on strike now.
969600	972600	I'm going to do what I want, when I want.
972600	975600	I'm not doing anything else apart from the water.
975600	978600	Because I cannot live without water.
980600	981600	Rolling!
983600	985600	Jamie has withdrawn her labour from the group
985600	988600	and will now only do the one job that benefits her,
988600	991600	collecting and purifying the water.
991600	993600	I'm going to be water bitch.
993600	995600	Because nobody else gets a shit.
995600	996600	I don't understand.
996600	998600	Where do you think it fucking comes from?
998600	999600	A tap?
1001600	1003600	I work on my own now,
1003600	1007600	so it's quite fun not having anybody to tell me what to do.
1007600	1010600	I don't really like anybody bossing me about.
1010600	1015600	On the island, ideally, I would really like a fun bunch of girls.
1015600	1018600	Anyone that took themselves too seriously,
1018600	1020600	I would find that a bit difficult.
1020600	1027600	It's just a never-ending circle of chores to be done.
1027600	1032600	In camp, the women are working through their long list of daily jobs.
1032600	1036600	We have basic chores that have to be done on a daily basis
1036600	1037600	or else we won't survive.
1037600	1042600	Getting wood for the fire, getting water and finding food.
1042600	1046600	And if we don't succeed in those, everything goes to hell in a handguard.
1046600	1049600	After this, I'm going to filter the water.
1049600	1053600	I'm going to filter the water and then I'm going to have a bath,
1053600	1058600	brush my teeth, wash my clothes, chill out.
1058600	1060600	Surviving takes hard graft
1060600	1063600	and everyone working together as a community.
1063600	1068600	You've got to do all you can to keep a group cohesive and together,
1068600	1070600	because when it's together, it's strong.
1070600	1073600	It's not strong when it's fragmented and broken.
1075600	1077600	Definitely have more water than you.
1077600	1078600	You bitch.
1078600	1079600	You talk too much.
1079600	1080600	Shut up.
1080600	1081600	You took the bag off.
1081600	1083600	You shouldn't have seen mine.
1083600	1086600	The water wonderers return.
1086600	1088600	Jamie starts purifying the water.
1088600	1091600	It's a process that takes up to three hours
1091600	1096600	but will now only produce one can's worth of water to drink.
1096600	1098600	I feel like I'm going to faint.
1098600	1101600	Julie and Havilah have moved on to their next job of the day,
1101600	1103600	collecting firewood.
1103600	1105600	Is that hard work, girls?
1105600	1108600	So hard work.
1108600	1110600	I have to sit down.
1110600	1112600	Down all the way.
1112600	1113600	Drained?
1113600	1114600	Drained.
1114600	1117600	My mum had an expression and it's very true.
1117600	1120600	Only willing horses get work to death.
1120600	1122600	My mum used to say that.
1122600	1123600	Dead now.
1123600	1125600	She was work to death.
1126600	1127600	She was.
1133600	1136600	You've got some colour, Jamie.
1136600	1137600	Good.
1137600	1140600	I'm going to bed in the Scottish again.
1140600	1141600	2pm.
1141600	1143600	While the other women remain hard at work,
1143600	1147600	Jamie is relaxing on the beach and it hasn't gone unnoticed.
1147600	1150600	I feel like I haven't stopped today.
1150600	1154600	Like, it's one job after the other after the other.
1154600	1156600	It's how it is.
1156600	1159600	Being here, you've just got to be so busy.
1159600	1161600	You've got to work as a team as well.
1161600	1162600	I know.
1162600	1163600	I know.
1163600	1168600	I struggle to understand how some people function
1168600	1170600	on just doing one thing a day.
1172600	1174600	Hey, tits McGee!
1174600	1176600	Who the fuck thought?
1176600	1179600	Jamie again, sunbathing on the beach.
1179600	1183600	There is a large handful of us that work solidly the whole time.
1183600	1185600	Not for ourselves, though.
1185600	1186600	For the whole team.
1186600	1188600	So the whole team can benefit from it.
1188600	1189600	I'm no good.
1189600	1191600	I'm no good.
1191600	1193600	Not everyone can benefit from it.
1193600	1194600	I'm naked here.
1194600	1196600	Stop filming me.
1196600	1199600	And not everyone has that same level of responsibility
1199600	1201600	and it's a joke.
1201600	1204600	Jamie is so annoying.
1204600	1206600	If she hadn't have gone and got water,
1206600	1209600	then she would have done absolutely nothing for the whole day.
1209600	1212600	Especially cos there's so much to do right now.
1212600	1215600	It just made me really frustrated and angry.
1215600	1220600	Kind of a little bit like, where's the fucking team spirit gone, man?
1220600	1221600	Bike meeting!
1221600	1226600	Something had to be said because I was getting fucked off.
1226600	1228600	We are a small group now.
1228600	1230600	There's only ten of us.
1230600	1233600	And so we need everybody to be hands on deck.
1233600	1235600	And that isn't happening.
1235600	1237600	It's becoming really obvious, like,
1237600	1240600	that certain people are doing lots of things
1240600	1244600	and sometimes I do feel like some people aren't doing as much.
1244600	1245600	Everybody is naked.
1245600	1246600	Everybody is naked.
1246600	1247600	Everybody is naked.
1247600	1248600	Everybody is naked.
1248600	1249600	Everybody is naked.
1249600	1250600	Everybody is naked.
1250600	1251600	Everybody is naked.
1251600	1253600	Everybody is depleted of energy in a way.
1253600	1257600	Get over that and accept that everyone has to pull their weight.
1257600	1260600	Does everyone feel like they are contributing the same?
1260600	1262600	That's what I would want.
1262600	1263600	Well, I do.
1263600	1265600	I do, yeah, actually.
1265600	1268600	I don't like sitting here, and people are making out,
1268600	1270600	as if some people are being lazy in the camp
1270600	1272600	and not pulling their weight.
1272600	1275600	It's not just a one-job day, which is my thing.
1275600	1276600	No, of course not.
1276600	1278600	But, you know, the jobs continue.
1278600	1283600	There are certain jobs that I don't feel that I actually need to partake in.
1283600	1285600	What do you mean by that?
1285600	1287600	I can help with things that will benefit me.
1287600	1289600	That means anything to do with water.
1289600	1291600	But things that won't benefit me?
1291600	1293600	No, I don't care.
1293600	1296600	It's just crazy, crazy talk.
1296600	1300600	It's just the lack of acknowledgement that, in fact,
1300600	1302600	they weren't pulling their weight.
1302600	1304600	How can you be so selfish?
1304600	1306600	How can you not give a shit about anybody else?
1306600	1310600	I mean, it's just complete bullshit.
1310600	1314600	I don't like getting told what to do and when to do it.
1314600	1317600	So if I want to lie down and sunbathe for an hour,
1317600	1319600	everybody else can fuck off.
1319600	1321600	Lauren's upset, Jamie's upset.
1321600	1323600	Interesting they've heard them both say
1323600	1325600	that they've been bullied by the other one.
1325600	1327600	I just think they should just hug it out.
1327600	1331600	Hug it out over a nice glass of warm swamp water.
1331600	1334600	With all the infighting, they've not noticed
1334600	1336600	that the water supply is dwindling.
1336600	1337600	It's turning to a standstill.
1337600	1339600	Realistically, the women need to drink
1339600	1341600	about three litres of water a day.
1341600	1343600	At the moment, with only one jerrycan,
1343600	1346600	they're averaging just one, and you can't sustain that.
1350600	1352600	Maybe a little drop more, darling?
1352600	1354600	Today, Jamie has managed to boil and filter
1354600	1356600	the one remaining jerrycan,
1356600	1358600	but water is already running low.
1358600	1360600	Doesn't look very much to me.
1360600	1362600	No, it's not much at all.
1362600	1364600	With not enough water to go round,
1364600	1366600	Julie and Georgina take the line
1366600	1369600	to the last cup before leaving camp to go fishing.
1369600	1371600	There's only so much water in a jerrycan,
1371600	1375600	and it just so happens that you are at the back of the queue
1375600	1377600	because you're doing other things
1377600	1379600	and you don't get to fill up your bottle,
1379600	1381600	then there's barely any water left for you.
1381600	1383600	I've got a nice bit of tangled net here,
1383600	1385600	which I'm going to try and get some crabs with.
1385600	1386600	Good, good.
1386600	1387600	Did you get your water?
1387600	1389600	Yeah, to me. Have you got yours?
1389600	1390600	Yeah.
1390600	1391600	Do you want to put it in there?
1391600	1392600	It's all right, I can manage it.
1392600	1393600	OK.
1396600	1400600	Come on, fellas.
1400600	1403600	Just even a little one.
1403600	1405600	Big saustern, isn't it?
1405600	1406600	Yeah.
1406600	1410600	Back in camp, Lauren and Becky are getting ready to hunt.
1410600	1412600	They're prepared, just in case.
1415600	1417600	We have no water to drink.
1417600	1419600	We're going to have to go, aren't we?
1419600	1420600	Yes, boss.
1420600	1423600	Lauren, Beth and Becky have to leave camp to hunt
1423600	1425600	with nothing to drink.
1426600	1429600	Trying to look for food in around here
1429600	1432600	is like trying to look for a needle in a haystack.
1432600	1436600	I definitely feel like Beyoncé in the Survivor video now.
1436600	1438600	It's not as glamorous.
1440600	1442600	Bit humid in here, isn't it?
1442600	1444600	Hot, no water either.
1444600	1446600	Not the best idea.
1446600	1449600	Without water, the heat is beating them,
1449600	1451600	and the hunting party have no choice
1451600	1453600	but to return to camp empty-handed.
1453600	1455600	Oh, my God, that sun is hot.
1455600	1456600	It is hot.
1459600	1461600	Come on, fishies.
1461600	1464600	On the rocks, Julie and Georgina have now been fishing
1464600	1467600	for four hours in 30-degree heat.
1467600	1469600	Oh, here's a boxfish.
1469600	1471600	Bugger off.
1471600	1472600	Look at that.
1472600	1475600	Don't you go any further forward on that wall.
1475600	1476600	Shit.
1476600	1478600	Oh, dear. My head just went, then.
1478600	1480600	Just sit down.
1480600	1481600	Oh, dear me.
1481600	1483600	I nearly hit the deck then, Julie.
1483600	1485600	Everything went white.
1485600	1487600	Oh, fucking hell.
1487600	1489600	Do you mind if we make our way back?
1489600	1490600	I just feel a bit rough.
1490600	1493600	I think the two of us have got sunstroke.
1493600	1496600	With their water intake now down to just one litre a day,
1496600	1498600	the women don't know it,
1498600	1501600	but they are chronically dehydrated.
1501600	1504600	If they don't start upping their fluid intake immediately,
1504600	1506600	their kidneys will struggle to cope,
1506600	1508600	toxins build up in your body,
1508600	1511600	and I reckon within days, their internal organs will shut down.
1511600	1513600	And I'm not being dramatic about this.
1513600	1514600	They're in a lot of trouble.
1514600	1516600	They're in a lot of trouble right now.
1518600	1521600	Oh, my God.
1521600	1524600	We've been out in the sun too long.
1524600	1527600	How are you doing, Jules?
1527600	1529600	It's a good source of love.
1529600	1533600	Every time we moved, like, to sit up, stand up or sit down,
1533600	1535600	you know, we'd go all, ooh.
1535600	1537600	You know what I mean?
1537600	1540600	I feel like we've been stupid to sit out in the sun in that heat
1540600	1543600	with no water in the middle of the day.
1543600	1545600	It's so frustrating.
1545600	1547600	It's so frustrating because we could see all the fish there
1547600	1549600	and we desperately wanted to...
1549600	1550600	I'm coming with you next time, Brie.
1550600	1552600	..catch them back.
1552600	1555600	I'm too tired to even speak.
1561600	1563600	I hate being like this.
1569600	1571600	It's horrible.
1571600	1574600	Not having the energy to do anything.
1578600	1582600	Yesterday, Julie and Georgina went fishing without enough water
1582600	1584600	and collapsed from dehydration.
1584600	1587600	I can't stand this lack of strength in myself
1587600	1589600	and lack of energy
1589600	1592600	and inability to keep going all day
1592600	1594600	because my body just won't let me.
1594600	1597600	Since discarding a contaminated jerrycan
1597600	1599600	and halving their water production,
1599600	1601600	it's slowly dawning on the water.
1601600	1604600	They've told the women that they're facing chronic dehydration.
1604600	1607600	There's just not enough water for everyone at the moment.
1607600	1610600	We've all got pretty much empty bottles at the moment,
1610600	1612600	so I now need to wait for this to get boiled,
1612600	1614600	which is going to take a long time.
1614600	1616600	Oh, fuck!
1616600	1617600	Oh!
1617600	1618600	What's up?
1618600	1620600	Water's just tipped over.
1620600	1622600	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
1622600	1624600	Oh, for fuck's sake!
1624600	1628600	Now, we've got one shitty jerrycan and it falls predictably.
1628600	1630600	I knew it was going to fucking fall,
1630600	1632600	but by the time she's picked it up,
1632600	1635600	all the water's fallen out.
1635600	1637600	I'm not drinking it off.
1637600	1639600	Nobody is.
1642600	1644600	I am feeling weak right now.
1644600	1645600	Are you?
1645600	1647600	I can't get up the sand.
1647600	1651600	It's like an effort to walk.
1651600	1654600	And it's so tiring.
1654600	1656600	I don't know about you, Georgie, but I keep going light-headed.
1656600	1657600	Do you?
1657600	1658600	Yeah, every time I bend over.
1658600	1659600	It's terrible.
1659600	1660600	That seems really strange,
1660600	1662600	but every time I sort of bend down to do something
1662600	1666600	and then get back up, I get really dizzy.
1666600	1671600	I think everyone's feeling the same, aren't they?
1671600	1673600	I am really, really concerned about each of us
1673600	1675600	because we're not drinking enough.
1675600	1678600	I mean, some people are drinking less than a litre a day.
1678600	1680600	I think it's just got worse and worse and worse.
1680600	1683600	Each of us is feeling like we're going to faint
1683600	1686600	at several points during the day.
1686600	1688600	Having spotted the tell-tale signs
1688600	1689600	of serious dehydration,
1689600	1692600	Dr Belinda calls an emergency meeting.
1692600	1694600	The biggest killer out here,
1694600	1697600	our biggest, highest risk is dehydration.
1697600	1700600	We should be getting two litres to four litres a day.
1700600	1704600	If everyone has one small bottle when you wake up,
1704600	1707600	then at least you're a quarter of the way there already.
1707600	1709600	Look, we are in scary territory
1709600	1712600	where we just don't know what's happening to our bodies
1712600	1716600	and there could be an effect on our vital organs as well.
1716600	1717600	Your kidneys,
1717600	1720600	and also your central nervous system.
1720600	1724600	So if you experience any weird symptoms at all, do tell me.
1726600	1729600	On that note, I just need a sample of your urine.
1729600	1734600	It's going to give me a general idea of any alarming kidney problems.
1734600	1735600	Hi, Belinda.
1735600	1737600	Yay, thank you.
1737600	1739600	Belinda will send the samples
1739600	1742600	to my support medical team on a nearby island.
1742600	1746600	So if any of us are in extreme danger, then what happens?
1746600	1749600	You'd be evacuated off.
1749600	1752600	If there's any indication of serious damage to your kidneys,
1752600	1755600	then we would need to look into that immediately.
1755600	1758600	And is it possible for some of us to be in this state
1758600	1760600	without knowing about it?
1760600	1764600	Yeah, because a lot of the symptoms mimic problems that we actually have.
1764600	1767600	Tiredness is a big thing with kidney failure.
1770600	1772600	Nausea as well.
1772600	1775600	We could well be in this serious situation, be unaware of it.
1776600	1779600	And it was quite alarming what she had to say, really,
1779600	1783600	about the way that our bodies can start to fail.
1783600	1785600	I suppose I should have paid more attention
1785600	1787600	to what was going to happen to my body.
1787600	1791600	I was surprised that I was potentially at such risk.
1792600	1795600	The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
1796600	1798600	Oh, my God!
1798600	1801600	Whose is that short one? Georgina.
1801600	1803600	It's like Guinness.
1806600	1809600	To investigate their health further,
1809600	1811600	Dr Belinda also weighs the women.
1813600	1815600	115.
1815600	1817600	I don't know what you were before.
1817600	1819600	I think I was 120.
1819600	1821600	We're quite fragile in a sense,
1821600	1827600	and the fact is that the things that are kind of deteriorating in my body
1827600	1829600	are my gums and my tits.
1829600	1833600	If that continues, then I will probably end up being skeletal
1833600	1835600	within about two or three weeks.
1836600	1838600	And just kind of give up and just be like,
1838600	1840600	do you know what, let the fucking vultures peck at me.
1840600	1842600	I was one too far.
1842600	1844600	Oh, so you've lost a lot, haven't you?
1844600	1847600	You are 116.
1848600	1850600	I can't have lost nine pounds.
1850600	1852600	You do look really, really thin.
1858600	1861600	I expected to lose a few pounds each week.
1861600	1863600	You're not fucking nine pounds.
1863600	1865600	Bit of a fucking hike, isn't it?
1866600	1869600	At that rate, I'm not...
1869600	1872600	You're going to be fucking carrying me off on a stretcher.
1872600	1874600	You know what I mean?
1874600	1876600	I'm so fucking tired.
1876600	1878600	You're tired cos you never bloody stop.
1878600	1880600	Well, that's...
1880600	1882600	You're like a bloody Duracell bunny, Julie.
1882600	1883600	I'm not.
1883600	1884600	You are.
1884600	1885600	Really not.
1885600	1886600	You are.
1886600	1888600	The women may feel at rock bottom,
1888600	1892600	but an instinct to stay alive really is deep within us all.
1892600	1895600	You know, our subconscious wants us to survive and to thrive.
1895600	1897600	Let's have a little scavenge
1897600	1899600	and see what we can find in this shit heap.
1899600	1903600	The group make a last-ditch attempt to produce more drinking water.
1903600	1905600	Having discarded one of the jerrycans,
1905600	1909600	Fi, Julie and the others forage for a second suitable container
1909600	1910600	to boil water.
1910600	1912600	What's that there?
1912600	1914600	Basically just a load of shit.
1914600	1916600	Nothing very useful, I don't think.
1916600	1919600	Metal is something that really is important.
1919600	1920600	I haven't seen any.
1920600	1921600	It's all plastic.
1921600	1923600	It's all plastic.
1923600	1924600	It's all plastic.
1924600	1927600	I mean, it's all plastic, and you can't obviously boil it.
1928600	1931600	I am certain it's plastic.
1931600	1934600	If we don't get the things we need, we won't survive.
1934600	1936600	It's as simple as that.
1936600	1938600	Plastic bottles.
1938600	1940600	Plastic cans.
1940600	1942600	Basically, plastic.
1942600	1943600	And that's it.
1943600	1945600	Oh, we don't want that!
1945600	1948600	They've failed to find any metal containers,
1948600	1950600	but Julie is not giving up.
1950600	1952600	We have to find something.
1953600	1956600	Desperately dehydrated, she hunts further afield
1956600	1958600	to find a second container.
1958600	1959600	We'll be tired.
1959600	1961600	We'll be high again in a minute.
1961600	1963600	Julie!
1963600	1965600	Julie!
1966600	1968600	You all right?
1968600	1969600	Julie!
1969600	1970600	Jesus.
1972600	1973600	Julie!
1973600	1974600	Julie!
1977600	1978600	Fucking hell, Jules.
1980600	1981600	Come on.
1981600	1983600	It's day 35,
1983600	1987600	and 55-year-old Julie has collapsed from dehydration.
1987600	1989600	I'm just so weak.
1990600	1992600	I'm so weak.
1992600	1994600	Get Bea and get on the blower.
1994600	1995600	No.
1996600	1997600	Jules, just no.
1997600	1999600	Don't ring anyone.
1999600	2000600	I'll get up now.
2000600	2002600	No, you won't. No, you won't. Just no.
2002600	2004600	Bea, Julie's passed out.
2004600	2006600	Stay there, Jules. Stay there.
2006600	2008600	Go ahead. Fox Rock.
2008600	2010600	We've got a situation here in that Jules
2010600	2012600	has passed out.
2012600	2015600	With Dr Belinda away from camp collecting water
2015600	2016600	and out of reach,
2016600	2019600	my emergency medical team on a nearby island
2019600	2021600	is immediately scrambled.
2021600	2022600	How are you feeling?
2022600	2024600	I think it was just...
2026600	2028600	It's all right. Just precautionary, OK?
2028600	2030600	What do you want to do, Julie?
2030600	2032600	How do you feel about trying to sit up for me?
2034600	2035600	How does it feel?
2035600	2037600	Just hold your pulse while you're sat up there.
2037600	2038600	Yeah.
2038600	2039600	Without drinking coffee.
2039600	2040600	Without drinking at all.
2040600	2041600	Without drinking today.
2041600	2043600	I haven't had a lot today, to be honest.
2043600	2044600	Nice.
2046600	2048600	You need to be constantly hydrated
2048600	2051600	to do the smallest tasks here.
2051600	2053600	And it really does go to show
2053600	2056600	that just in one little moment here,
2056600	2057600	it can all change.
2060600	2063600	I'm happy you're bright enough. Everything's fine.
2063600	2065600	Honestly, girl, please.
2065600	2066600	I'm so nervous.
2066600	2067600	Right.
2067600	2068600	She's dehydrated.
2068600	2069600	You're all dehydrated.
2069600	2071600	If you can just keep an eye on her.
2071600	2073600	You put a whole load of fit soldier on iron like this
2073600	2074600	for weeks and weeks,
2074600	2076600	and they'd struggle with it as well.
2076600	2078600	No, definitely not a game.
2081600	2083600	Oh, you're awful good to me.
2085600	2087600	I don't think I'm a drama queen,
2087600	2088600	but I think...
2090600	2094600	..I could have just closed my eyes and drifted off.
2099600	2101600	I'm not cool like that.
2108600	2112600	Even the strongest women are slowly dying of thirst.
2112600	2114600	I might need to lie down again.
2114600	2116600	For nearly five weeks,
2116600	2119600	the group has been subsisting on barely any food,
2119600	2121600	and they remain down one jerry can,
2121600	2124600	producing half the water they need to survive.
2124600	2126600	Basically, I think I...
2126600	2129600	..either almost fainted
2129600	2131600	or very briefly...
2131600	2134600	..very briefly lost consciousness.
2137600	2139600	The signs of chronic dehydration
2139600	2142600	really are now starting to show amongst women.
2142600	2143600	And to give you an idea,
2143600	2146600	just losing just 5% of your body weight in water
2146600	2149600	leads to irritability, headaches, lightheadedness.
2149600	2153600	When you get to 8%, the lack of water causes fainting fits.
2153600	2155600	After that, delirium.
2155600	2157600	Delirium, an hallucination set in.
2157600	2161600	And when you get to 15% to 20% of your body weight lost,
2161600	2162600	you're dead.
2164600	2167600	It's literally just our minds now getting us through it.
2167600	2169600	It's literally just people being like,
2169600	2171600	I am going to finish this, I am going to finish this,
2171600	2174600	that is keeping us going, like you did yesterday.
2174600	2176600	No, it isn't. I'm not going home.
2176600	2178600	I'm not going home. Exactly.
2178600	2180600	The group's on their arse at the minute, Georgia.
2180600	2182600	The group is completely on their arse.
2183600	2184600	The results of everyone's work
2184600	2188600	and the results of everyone's emergency urine tests are back.
2189600	2191600	Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is...
2191600	2196600	All 10 altogether can hear you loud and clear. Over.
2196600	2199600	Paramedic Mike and survival expert Ross,
2199600	2202600	my rapid response unit on a nearby island,
2202600	2204600	have urgently asked to speak to the whole camp.
2204600	2206600	I'm looking at your urine results and things.
2206600	2209600	Yeah, and I'm looking at your weight charts and everything.
2209600	2213600	And I'm looking at people whose kidney function
2213600	2215600	is on a decline.
2215600	2220600	And I cannot stand by and let that decline continue.
2220600	2223600	Based on the fact that what I'm looking at
2223600	2225600	and what I saw the other day...
2225600	2227600	..and your dietary input,
2227600	2231600	it's not enough to keep you going
2231600	2234600	without causing you all, or certainly...
2234600	2237600	..a number of you, some long-term problems.
2237600	2241600	Your bodies are just starting to fail at this point.
2241600	2244600	Now, there's no easy way to say this.
2244600	2246600	I'm teetering right on the brink
2246600	2250600	of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons. Over.
2255600	2257600	Bloody hell.
2257600	2261600	Yeah, I think everyone really understands. Over.
2261600	2265600	The solution is use the other jerry can.
2265600	2267600	I can't say it any other way.
2267600	2270600	You need to be drinking, at a minimum,
2270600	2273600	three litres of water per day.
2273600	2276600	Worst-case scenario, when you're all sitting in a hospital,
2276600	2280600	the thought of drinking out of a slightly disgusting jerry can
2280600	2283600	that's had pigs in it will not seem as bad
2283600	2286600	as potentially a lifetime on dialysis.
2286600	2288600	Copy that.
2291600	2294600	If you do not get control...
2294600	2296600	..in 36 hours' time, you're out.
2296600	2299600	In 36 hours' time, you're coming off the island. Over.
2300600	2301600	There you go.
2303600	2307600	The women have just 36 hours to pull back from the brink.
2308600	2310600	They're not fucking about.
2310600	2312600	We are going to be pulled off this island.
2312600	2314600	I mean, very fucking seriously.
2314600	2317600	I know that we all need water, full stop,
2317600	2320600	and that's the only thing that's going to stop our kidneys failing.
2320600	2323600	Secondarily, let's get some regular food into us.
2323600	2325600	That's going to help with our general energy levels.
2325600	2327600	For us to get to the end of this,
2327600	2330600	it's about keeping our energy levels up
2330600	2332600	and hydration levels up
2332600	2335600	so that we actually survive for the next couple of days
2335600	2337600	and don't go into renal failure.
2337600	2340600	And if we don't, then we're going to be taken off
2340600	2342600	and we're all going to look like massive dickheads.
2342600	2345600	I know some people are struggling more than others,
2345600	2348600	but what we need to do is, you know,
2348600	2353600	try and work together without causing arguments,
2353600	2354600	disagreements, arguments.
2354600	2356600	Unnecessary stress.
2356600	2358600	Everyone's knackered, everyone is tired,
2358600	2361600	everyone has no energy, hasn't eaten food,
2361600	2364600	we're all in the same boat, but we all need to come together.
2364600	2366600	Exactly. We have to get through it.
2366600	2368600	We have to pull together.
2369600	2372600	And in a way, it's going to force us to do that.
2372600	2375600	At times, we work as individuals and not really work as a team,
2375600	2378600	but we're going to have to. We have to work together now.
2380600	2383600	When a group faces a life-threatening crisis,
2383600	2386600	do you lie down and die, or do you pick yourself up
2386600	2389600	and determine that you're going to control your destiny?
2389600	2392600	You're going to go out there, you're going to be resourceful,
2392600	2395600	you're going to work hard, and you're going to turn the situation around.
2395600	2399600	If these women have any hope of surviving, it means teamwork,
2399600	2402600	and that takes courage and hard graft.
2404600	2407600	I've got to cross that swamp. Yeah.
2407600	2411600	With everyone agreed they need the crucial second jerrycan,
2411600	2413600	Fi has volunteered to return.
2413600	2415600	They retrieve and sanitise it,
2415600	2418600	so the women can immediately double their water intake.
2418600	2421600	That can is going to be full of all sorts of shit and bugs.
2421600	2424600	I'm not really breathing very deeply.
2424600	2429600	Rank with putrid pork, it's been sweltering in the swamp for ten days.
2429600	2432600	Oh, nice. Splashed on my foot.
2432600	2436600	But sometimes the island can be unexpectedly generous.
2436600	2438600	Not that smelly, is it?
2438600	2440600	Absolutely amazing.
2440600	2442600	It doesn't smell rank on any level.
2442600	2444600	Maybe the maggots have done the job.
2444600	2446600	There's a lot to be said for maggots.
2448600	2451600	I'm so glad we got that jerrycan back, actually.
2452600	2455600	Now the two-jerrycan system is back up and running,
2455600	2458600	the women should at last be able to hit the daily target
2458600	2460600	of three litres of water each.
2460600	2462600	So, we've got one can on the boil.
2462600	2465600	And I just want to get this one filtered.
2465600	2468600	I'm less stressed now about the water.
2468600	2470600	Just drink that anyway, shut up.
2470600	2472600	Get it down you.
2472600	2474600	I'll just squeeze a wee out.
2474600	2476600	Thank God.
2476600	2478600	But I don't want to...
2478600	2480600	I'm not leaving.
2481600	2485600	We've been walking too long before we find some yucca.
2485600	2488600	With the water production line back on a roll,
2488600	2490600	Jamie is happy to return to work,
2490600	2492600	joining forces with Lauren and Beth
2492600	2494600	to find some fresh water to drink.
2494600	2496600	It's been a long journey.
2496600	2498600	She's joined forces with Lauren and Beth
2498600	2501600	to find carbohydrates the group urgently needs.
2501600	2503600	God, I can barely walk.
2503600	2505600	It's really hard.
2505600	2507600	It's hard, you know, being in a group
2507600	2509600	and put under so much stress.
2509600	2511600	And nobody's perfect.
2511600	2514600	Everybody has their moments.
2514600	2517600	But we have to stick together as a team.
2517600	2519600	Our muscles are stronger.
2519600	2520600	I can see some yucca.
2520600	2522600	What have you got there?
2522600	2523600	Woo!
2523600	2525600	Boom!
2525600	2526600	Woo-hoo!
2526600	2527600	Oh!
2527600	2528600	Woo-hoo!
2528600	2529600	Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
2529600	2531600	Yeeees!
2531600	2532600	Woo-hoo!
2532600	2534600	Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
2534600	2537600	Yeah, we're cooking on gas now, girls.
2537600	2540600	Look, once you see one, you see them all.
2540600	2541600	Oh, my.
2541600	2542600	A lot.
2542600	2544600	Small but perfectly formed.
2544600	2545600	Uh-oh.
2545600	2547600	Lauren has always.
2551600	2553600	The girls got yucca.
2553600	2555600	Yeah, we got yucca.
2555600	2556600	Woo!
2556600	2558600	That's amazing, Lauren.
2558600	2560600	Yeah, Lauren!
2560600	2562600	Yes, not just me.
2562600	2564600	High-five!
2564600	2566600	Yay!
2566600	2569600	Check out my yucca.
2569600	2571600	Do you like a piece of my yucca?
2571600	2573600	In and around all night.
2577600	2579600	Please, you're right on the edge. It's freaking me out.
2579600	2581600	It's all right, love.
2581600	2584600	A rehydrated Julie is with Georgie and Beth,
2584600	2588600	determined to finally land that elusive fish for supper.
2588600	2590600	OK, another little fishy.
2590600	2593600	And they've come up with a new way to attract fish,
2593600	2595600	a sparkling lure.
2595600	2598600	And that is a state-of-the-art bit of fishing kit there.
2598600	2600600	Fishing tackle. Right.
2600600	2603600	Coca-Cola, give us some luck.
2603600	2607600	If I get pulled in, I'm going to swim round that way.
2607600	2608600	You won't.
2608600	2611600	I'm so cack-handed at everything.
2611600	2613600	Ooh!
2613600	2614600	I can see, like...
2614600	2616600	Ooh!
2616600	2617600	Ooh!
2617600	2618600	As hard as you can.
2618600	2621600	Oh!
2621600	2624600	Oh, my God! I can't believe it!
2624600	2627600	Caught a fish! Is it alive?
2627600	2630600	Well done, Julie!
2630600	2633600	Oh, my God! I thought you were going to...
2633600	2635600	Sucker!
2635600	2637600	Dinner!
2637600	2639600	Basically, whatever it takes to stay.
2639600	2641600	Whatever it takes.
2642600	2643600	Go on, Georgie.
2643600	2644600	Go on, Jules.
2644600	2646600	We'll trade that fisherman to give us some fish.
2647600	2649600	Hola!
2650600	2652600	Hola!
2652600	2653600	He's coming.
2653600	2658600	Not content with just one small fish, Julie spots another opportunity,
2658600	2662600	the first passing boat the women have seen in these waters.
2662600	2665600	I don't know, Jules, it's your turn to get the backs out.
2665600	2669600	He's not going to want to see a 55-year-old's backs.
2669600	2671600	I don't know, mate, your backs are way better than mine.
2671600	2674600	You have fish?
2674600	2675600	You have fish?
2675600	2677600	One fish?
2677600	2678600	Fish!
2678600	2679600	We have none.
2679600	2681600	We have none. No fish.
2681600	2682600	He's going to throw it!
2682600	2685600	Oh, you're very, very kind.
2685600	2688600	Whoa!
2688600	2689600	Thank you very much.
2689600	2690600	Thank you.
2690600	2692600	Bless you. Bless you.
2692600	2695600	Good luck.
2695600	2698600	Gracias, amigo!
2698600	2699600	Now, I think that is...
2699600	2700600	Ah!
2700600	2702600	I think that is a...
2702600	2703600	Barracuda.
2703600	2705600	Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
2705600	2706600	Ah!
2706600	2708600	I could just go, ah!
2708600	2710600	And bite it and eat it raw.
2710600	2711600	I'm so hungry.
2711600	2716600	I don't know whether that was actually playing by Queensberry rules,
2716600	2719600	but innovation, innovation, innovation.
2719600	2721600	Whoo!
2721600	2723600	We caught a fish!
2723600	2724600	Yeah!
2724600	2726600	Oh, my God, it's massive!
2726600	2728600	Whoo!
2728600	2729600	This is a Barracuda.
2729600	2730600	Barracuda.
2730600	2731600	Barracuda.
2731600	2732600	Barracuda.
2732600	2733600	Barracuda.
2733600	2734600	Barracuda.
2734600	2735600	Barracuda.
2735600	2736600	Yeah!
2736600	2737600	Barracuda.
2737600	2739600	Oh, my God, you guys are incredible.
2739600	2744600	Incredible, I love it.
2744600	2747600	Smells amazing.
2747600	2749600	We should have got this place licked.
2749600	2750600	You know, ten women, hey,
2750600	2753600	this place should have been ship-shaped.
2753600	2755600	Tragically, not the case.
2755600	2757600	There's the hero of the moment.
2757600	2758600	I don't even want to talk.
2758600	2760840	I don't even want a twirl. It's still tasty.
2762280	2764400	But at least we've started now.
2765440	2766280	Not too late.
2770880	2773160	Next time on The Men's Island.
2773160	2774360	It's little old me.
2774360	2775960	Unfortunately, I don't trust you.
2778600	2779440	Whoa!
2779440	2781000	There's a death trap round here.
2781000	2782120	Snake!
2782120	2782960	Okay.
2782960	2784400	We have no food.
2784400	2785240	Stop it!
2785240	2786240	Holy shit!
2815240	2820200	THE MEN'S ISLAND
