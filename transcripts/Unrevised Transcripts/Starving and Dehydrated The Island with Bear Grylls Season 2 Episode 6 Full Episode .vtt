00:00.000 --> 00:14.700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.700 --> 00:22.920
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll

00:22.920 --> 00:29.880
be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming

00:29.880 --> 00:37.080
everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance so thin now will it be brute

00:37.080 --> 00:44.700
power or mental strength the winds a day watch him watch him go now go now who will have what

00:44.700 --> 00:58.020
it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than

00:58.020 --> 00:59.760
ever they'll have to make fire

00:59.880 --> 01:09.660
hunt for food and find water oh living on the island in the middle of Tropical storm season

01:11.220 --> 01:17.580
I'm still wet worse night's sleep like surely I'm gonna die soon hang on

01:20.400 --> 01:22.740
when pitted against the extremes of nature

01:24.780 --> 01:28.080
have these Monday women got what it takes to survive

01:29.880 --> 01:34.980
just remember to how you felt when you felt and leave it there

01:43.800 --> 01:49.380
it's been seven days since 14 British women were marooned on a remote Pacific Island

01:49.380 --> 01:59.460
brutal conditions have already claimed two victims

01:59.880 --> 02:06.780
I need to go it's been with my family and the group paid the price when they split to

02:06.780 --> 02:12.240
find a sustainable water source we cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost

02:12.240 --> 02:25.140
finally reunited after three days apart the women find themselves on the northern tip of the island

02:25.140 --> 02:29.760
they have no water source and many haven't had a drop to drink for two days

02:29.880 --> 02:39.540
it's sunny

02:41.220 --> 02:53.100
so it is blaring so hot there is no outside input and it is up to us to survive and thrive

02:53.100 --> 02:55.320
that is a heck of a challenge

02:56.700 --> 02:57.840
oh my gosh

02:57.840 --> 02:59.840
despite the oppressive

02:59.840 --> 03:13.520
30 degree heat there's something to celebrate for one of the party if you'd

03:13.520 --> 03:17.180
have asked me a year ago where I'll be spending my 25th birthday I definitely

03:17.180 --> 03:21.440
would not have been saying oh my 25th birthday will be spent abandoned on an

03:21.440 --> 03:28.260
island dehydrated and starving for the last five days the women have barely

03:28.260 --> 03:38.160
eaten and had hardly anything to drink finding water it's a priority the only

03:38.160 --> 03:41.860
reason we're not thinking about food is because we're so thirsty our body

03:41.860 --> 03:47.500
basically tries and like compensates for everything that we're lacking when it

03:47.500 --> 03:51.700
comes to survival I often talk about the rule of three which means you can survive

03:51.700 --> 03:56.100
three minutes without air three days without water three weeks without food

03:56.100 --> 03:58.240
and in temperatures like this the water is not enough for you to survive you

03:58.240 --> 04:03.280
women have got to drink a lot between two or four liters of water a day if

04:03.280 --> 04:12.580
they don't they're finished the Sun obviously makes you feel more dehydrated

04:12.580 --> 04:19.120
and more weak without a sustainable water source they're surviving on rain

04:19.120 --> 04:25.000
water but there hasn't been a drop for 48 hours looking at the sea you just

04:25.000 --> 04:28.240
want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea you just want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea

04:28.240 --> 04:37.940
it's really about diet iron brew cold freezing cold diet iron brew with ice

04:37.940 --> 04:41.500
oh my god my other birthday's and I'm stressing out because no one's got me a

04:41.500 --> 04:45.520
card or no one's come out for a meal and I'm just gonna be happy with some a

04:45.520 --> 04:49.020
piece of fruit and some water

04:49.020 --> 04:55.500
I think a bogey just came out my nose

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
eat it! eat it! eat it!

04:58.240 --> 05:00.240
Waste! Waste nothing!

05:03.240 --> 05:05.240
I've always loved adventure.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.240
In December 2013, I set off on transatlantic rowing race,

05:09.240 --> 05:12.240
3,000 miles across to Antigua.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.240
It's the 30th of January and we have just had a capsize.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.240
I have split my head open.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.240
I didn't want to give up.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.240
It had been 96 days of pushing my body and pushing my mind

05:25.240 --> 05:27.240
further than I ever had before,

05:27.240 --> 05:29.240
but we still had to give up.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.240
So that's hard to come to terms with.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.240
I will not get off the island.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.240
I have to prove to myself that I can do it.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.240
Happy birthday, Lauren.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.240
Superwoman.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.240
She's keeping us all sane.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.240
She's keeping us all sane.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
Celebrations are short-lived.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.240
The women have a life-or-death priority.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.240
Seeing the effect that dehydration has,

05:53.240 --> 05:57.240
I couldn't really have predicted that it could be so disabling.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.240
We ain't coming back until we've found water.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.240
We ain't coming back until we've found water.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.240
Georgie leads a group on a scouting mission

06:09.240 --> 06:11.240
into the thick jungle.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
into the thick jungle.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.240
There are no pools, which is what we're after.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.240
There are no pools, which is what we're after.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.240
I've made sure that the island has got enough water,

06:21.240 --> 06:24.240
indigenous animals, and vegetation on it to keep them alive,

06:24.240 --> 06:26.240
but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it,

06:26.240 --> 06:28.240
That's quite a deep pool. It's empty.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
It's just the same shit.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.240
If we don't find water, we're screwed.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.240
What is that?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.240
Oh, my God, there's two piglets!

06:42.240 --> 06:44.240
Oh, my God!

06:46.240 --> 06:48.240
Oh, my God.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.240
Be careful cos if Mum's there...

06:51.240 --> 06:53.240
I can actually see Mum over here.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.240
Oh, oh, careful. Come away.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.240
If Mum thinks the kids are threatened,

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
that's when they get really aggressive.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.240
She's lying down. Come away, sweetheart.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.240
She's massive. She's enormous.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.240
She's, like, really near.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.240
The piglets, the first thing I thought of was crackling,

07:14.240 --> 07:16.240
to be honest.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.240
I am hungry.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.240
I don't think I could look into his little piggy eyes

07:21.240 --> 07:24.240
and then kill him. I'm not ready for that yet.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.240
But then again,

07:25.240 --> 07:27.240
by the time I come home,

07:27.240 --> 07:31.240
I'll probably be a full-blown fucking, I don't know, cannibal.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.240
The pigs are given a reprieve.

07:33.240 --> 07:37.240
Right now, everyone's lives depend on finding water.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.240
What are we going to do?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.240
You can sit down.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
Oh!

07:46.240 --> 07:48.240
Ah!

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
We're all buggered.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.240
No energy to move.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.240
Brian? You all right?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.240
Are you OK? What's wrong?

08:01.240 --> 08:04.240
Whenever I stand up, I just see all black.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
That's dehydration, babe.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.240
The situation is now critical.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.240
We're going foraging. Water.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.240
In a do-or-die attempt to find water...

08:18.240 --> 08:20.240
Please be careful.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.240
..Georgie and Fi strike out in the midday sun.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.240
I just think...

08:27.240 --> 08:32.240
I just couldn't sit and wilt in that sun down there.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.240
The weather here is brutal.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.240
You know, you've got 90%-plus humidity.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
The heat here is oppressive.

08:41.240 --> 08:45.240
So finding that fresh water source is vital.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.240
The bottom line is, you go three days without it, you're dead.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.240
It's so hot today. So, so hot.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.240
I think we should look on here and then go back.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.240
I think I'm being in a much better way.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.240
I think we should look on here and then go back.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.240
I'm not eating.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.240
Really fast.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.240
Ooh!

09:17.240 --> 09:19.240
Hard work.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.240
It's water. Ah! This looks good.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
Jesus Christ!

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
We did it!

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
We did it!

09:25.240 --> 09:27.240
Oh, yeah, baby.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.240
I don't give a fuck where that came from.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.240
We're drinking it.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Oh!

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
Amazing.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.240
So, we hit the jackpot.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.240
Picked this out.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
OK, it's not over yet.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.240
But you know what?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.240
If I die, I don't care.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.240
At least I don't die thirsty.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.240
Hmm.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.240
Obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.240
But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.240
All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.240
And no matter how clean the water looks, you've got to boil it.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.240
Guess what I've got?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
Water!

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
Oh, yeah!

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
Oh, my God!

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
I'm not going to lie to you.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.240
You drink it at your own risk.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.240
It came from a waterfall, and it tastes fine.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
Don't drink it.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.240
Every water from waterfall, river, whatever,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.240
has to be filtered and boiled.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.240
Because of the parasites, it's just...

10:32.240 --> 10:34.240
It's a death trap.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.240
Complete.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.240
The whole island is a death trap.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.240
The thing is, though, we need to get this fire started,

10:39.240 --> 10:41.240
because if we don't get this fire started, we're back to zero again.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.240
We're back to no fucking water.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.240
They haven't been able to start a fire for three days.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.240
If they're to survive, this is their last chance.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.240
Oh, my God.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.240
I won't stop until the fire is ready.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.240
Because then I know that we can drink.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
Yeah.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
Just go through that smoke.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.240
Pretend it's not even smoking.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
I think we've got it, I think we've got it.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.240
Go, stop, stop.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.240
It's really hard.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.240
And again, and again.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.240
It's got enough...

11:12.240 --> 11:14.240
It's there, it's there, it's there.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
Well done!

11:15.240 --> 11:17.240
Guys, we've got fire!

11:17.240 --> 11:20.240
Well done, girls!

11:20.240 --> 11:21.240
Woo!

11:21.240 --> 11:22.240
Woo!

11:23.240 --> 11:25.240
Can we just taste the water?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.240
Ah, look, look, look, look, look, look.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.240
Look at that fire.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.240
The water won't be safe to drink

11:32.240 --> 11:34.240
until it has boiled some three hours later.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.240
Meanwhile, Lauren's keeping the fire going.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.240
The fire is so hot, it's burning through everything.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
The busty girl...

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
Yeah.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.240
..is doing all the hard work, and she's exhausted.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
I'd say that Lauren and Beth...

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
Lauren and Beth...

11:49.240 --> 11:51.240
..are always the first in there to help.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.240
Rosé, they think of things.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.240
Oh, shit!

11:56.240 --> 11:57.240
Oh, shit!

11:57.240 --> 11:59.240
Lauren, Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!

11:59.240 --> 12:00.240
Go to the sea now!

12:00.240 --> 12:01.240
Fucking hell!

12:01.240 --> 12:03.240
Shit!

12:03.240 --> 12:06.240
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.240
Oh, fuck!

12:07.240 --> 12:09.240
Right in there, babe!

12:09.240 --> 12:11.240
Get her right immersed in the sea.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.240
Jesus!

12:12.240 --> 12:17.240
Oh, fuck!

12:17.240 --> 12:18.240
Oh, shit!

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!

12:19.240 --> 12:20.240
Go to the sea!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.240
Go into the sea now!

12:22.240 --> 12:24.240
Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.240
Day seven on the island,

12:26.240 --> 12:29.240
and Lauren's been tending a jerrycan of boiling water on the fire.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.240
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.240
Jesus! What's happened? What's happened?

12:35.240 --> 12:38.240
The pressure of the jerrycan has exploded.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
How are you feeling?

12:40.240 --> 12:42.240
Fine. OK.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.240
Stay there for now. Keep in the water.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.240
For the moment, Dr Belinda can't tell how badly scolded Lauren is.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.240
What you say is to run whatever it is under cold water for exactly...

12:53.240 --> 12:56.240
We'll see the extent of it in a minute.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.240
Just everything seems to be going a bit...

12:59.240 --> 13:01.240
It's just her 15 years old,

13:01.240 --> 13:04.240
so she thinks Lauren's, like, one of our strongest people.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.240
So if she goes down, I think it would be a big detriment to us.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.240
It's like doing your water on your engine.

13:11.240 --> 13:16.240
You've got to let it cool down before you open the top screw top.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.240
If her burns prove to be severe,

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
Lauren will be in trouble.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.240
Lauren may have to be evacuated.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.240
Poor Lauren. She's not having the best birthday ever.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.240
She's dehydrated and now scolded by boiling water.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.240
I'm just going to keep dampening you and letting it cool.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.240
Hopefully she will be back to full strength soon.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.240
Lauren's face isn't scolded,

13:35.240 --> 13:39.240
and Dr Belinda believes she can treat the burns on her arm.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.240
Especially in the blistered area. That's the worst bit.

13:42.240 --> 13:48.240
It feels like someone is singeing my arm with a hot poker.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.240
I feel like people see that I'm feeling just as weak as them

13:52.240 --> 13:55.240
because I actually feel like some people need strength

13:55.240 --> 13:57.240
and other people to keep them going,

13:57.240 --> 13:59.240
and I'm determined to be that person.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.240
It's alive!

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
I'm still standing.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.240
It won't get boring, it won't get boring.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.240
Despite the jerrycan exploding,

14:11.240 --> 14:15.240
just enough water remains for everyone to have a life-saving drink.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.240
Pick your own bottle.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.240
Is it all the same?

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
You just used it once.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.240
No, I asked for whisky and coke.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.240
Oh, I've went for some aloe vera.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.240
Original drink.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.240
And aloe vera is disgusting.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.240
I tried it with a detox and it tastes like sperm.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.240
There's a pig! Pig! There!

14:43.240 --> 14:45.240
Oh, yeah!

14:45.240 --> 14:47.240
Now they have a water source, food.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.240
Food should be the women's big priority.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.240
Biggie, biggie, biggies!

14:51.240 --> 14:53.240
Hello!

14:53.240 --> 14:55.240
All they've eaten in a week

14:55.240 --> 14:58.240
are a few handfuls of yucca and coconut.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.240
We've got two of the cutest little piglets here.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.240
Their little tails wag like dogs. They're so cute.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.240
Everything that moves on that island

15:08.240 --> 15:10.240
really should be seen as a potential source of food,

15:10.240 --> 15:12.240
and that includes the pigs.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.240
Oh, you're so cute! Come here, Sage!

15:15.240 --> 15:17.240
Onion!

15:17.240 --> 15:19.240
Ooh!

15:19.240 --> 15:22.240
To befriend them is just going to make the decision

15:22.240 --> 15:24.240
to kill them a thousand times more difficult.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.240
And really, in survival, there's no room for sentiment.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.240
Sorry, I'm just being joined here.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.240
I can hear you squeaking. What are you squeaking about?

15:35.240 --> 15:38.240
And everyone's like, oh, they're so cute, they're so cute.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.240
Like, we're going to eat them as pets.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.240
And I'm like, I'm just thinking, you know,

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
put that girl's, like...

15:43.240 --> 15:45.240
We're literally going to slice and dice those piggies.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.240
Definitely, we're eating them.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.240
Suckling pig.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.240
Nah.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.240
Would you not eat them?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.240
No, they're so cute.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.240
I don't care that they're cute.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.240
As the time goes on, we'll be hungrier and hungrier,

15:59.240 --> 16:04.240
but I am not killing the little piglets and eating them.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.240
No way.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
They're so funny.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.240
Argh!

16:11.240 --> 16:14.240
I've been a vegetarian basically since I was born.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
I think it's going to be a massive challenge,

16:16.240 --> 16:21.240
if I have to, by choice, eat meat.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.240
But then again, maybe it's not going to be a choice,

16:24.240 --> 16:28.240
because I'll be so starving and I'll just have to eat it.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.240
I would definitely say I'm an animal person

16:32.240 --> 16:34.240
rather than a people's person.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
You know, animals are less stressful sometimes.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.240
I will train them pigs.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.240
I'll kick them up the arse.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.240
The moral argument is,

16:45.240 --> 16:49.240
is do we now eat the pigs,

16:49.240 --> 16:53.240
but then do you kill, essentially, your pet?

16:53.240 --> 16:55.240
Piggy, piggy, piggies.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.240
Sagey, onion.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.240
With water running low...

17:06.240 --> 17:09.240
Careful, these rocks are uber fucking slippy.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.240
..an expedition party makes the hazardous journey

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
back to the waterfall.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.240
That's it, guys, we're nearly there.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.240
Jamie, hang on.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.240
Oh!

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
Shit.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.240
I saved the camera!

17:24.240 --> 17:25.240
Good job.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
That's it there.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.240
Shit doesn't look like it's running, for fuck's sake.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.240
No!

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
I don't understand.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.240
This was pouring with water the other day.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.240
And it's dry.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
It's like...

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
Toll-oo.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.240
Toll-oo.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.240
Every day, it's gone.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.240
The water source may be dry,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.240
but fortunately in the tropics,

17:57.240 --> 17:59.240
the weather can change in an instant.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
Look at that.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.240
I've never seen such a dirty grey cloud as that.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.240
Oh, here it comes!

18:09.240 --> 18:11.240
Let's get water quick before this happens.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.240
Can you pass me the bottle one by one and pass them over to me?

18:13.240 --> 18:16.240
Violent Pacific storms can dump an inch of water in an hour.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.240
The women need to take their chances when they can.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:21.240 --> 18:23.240
We need to try and protect the fire!

18:23.240 --> 18:25.240
The wood's getting saturated.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.240
Congratulations.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.240
They're using Georgie's poncho to save the fire,

18:40.240 --> 18:44.240
but half the group has tied up trying to collect rainwater.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.240
I can't fucking believe this.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.240
I can't think it's organised when they feed.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
Oh, hello, piggies!

18:49.240 --> 18:52.240
Oh, they're getting sheltered.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.240
Oh, it's cooking itself, really.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.240
They're going to roast themselves.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.240
Let them roast themselves.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.240
Is that a tornado?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.240
Wow.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
Do you want to see what's inside?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
So, there it goes.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.240
It's like a big thing in the sky.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.240
Honestly, I've never seen anything like it.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
If that touches down, we're in trouble.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.240
Oh, my God.

19:14.240 --> 19:19.240
At their worst, water tornadoes are capable of travelling up to 150 miles an hour.

19:19.240 --> 19:23.240
If this hits the island, it could destroy everything in its path.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.240
It's like one of those.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.240
It's growing as well.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.240
It is growing.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.240
That's pretty scary.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.240
We're really vulnerable here and no-one can get through anything like that happens.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
Well, hang on.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.240
Is it dissipating or is it just curving?

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
It's gone.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.240
It seems to have just split up and gone.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.240
We'll get to live another day.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.240
Shame.

19:52.240 --> 19:57.240
While they've kept the fire alight, they've hardly collected any water.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.240
Is that the total amount of what we've just got from that rainfall?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.240
Yeah.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.240
I am struggling.

20:05.240 --> 20:11.240
As much as we nest here, Mother Nature turns up and she just shits on it.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.240
And it's like a fucking mudslide everywhere now.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.240
It's become clear to the women they can't survive here on Coconut Beach.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.240
They must move camp.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
Whoa!

20:21.240 --> 20:25.240
Five days ago, the women discovered a beach on the western side of the island

20:25.240 --> 20:28.240
with a sustainable water source nearby.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
They christened it Home Beach.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.240
Now, Lauren wants to take everyone back there.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.240
You need to get to that Home Beach now.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.240
The beach, the water...

20:39.240 --> 20:42.240
It's just going to make people feel like they can actually do this.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.240
I'm pretty confident in where that beach is.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.240
We do have a serious problem with water.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.240
Hopefully, Home Beach is going to sort all that out.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.240
There's a stream there.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.240
Yeah, and this is the, like, resources.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.240
We can start making our shelters.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.240
You guys haven't seen it.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
You guys haven't seen it yet either, have you?

21:01.240 --> 21:06.240
So, I've got this image of this beach that flows for, like, miles.

21:06.240 --> 21:13.240
Palm trees, hammocks, shelter, waterfall, fish jumping from the sea.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.240
Yeah, we saw that. We did see that.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.240
Oh, I'm so excited.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.240
What's the plan with the fire, guys?

21:19.240 --> 21:21.240
Are we going to try and transport it?

21:21.240 --> 21:23.240
We haven't got anything metal, have we, yet?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.240
So, we'll just have to light another one.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
It's all right, we're experts now.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
I'm excited. It's going to be eight.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.240
Who would like the first snail?

21:34.240 --> 21:37.240
Sage and onion remain off the menu.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.240
Tonight, it's just foraged snails.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.240
It's quite salty, quite meaty,

21:43.240 --> 21:46.240
and then there's this sharp, like, shit, basically.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.240
And a good meal always prompts a lively conversation.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.240
Is that it? That's it.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.240
It's small.

21:55.240 --> 21:58.240
I had the South African with the tiny little penis.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.240
It was definitely a micro-penis because it was smaller than my pinky.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.240
No, like, you know...

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
I said it was smaller than my pinky!

22:06.240 --> 22:08.240
No, seriously, Beth, it's not even funny.

22:09.240 --> 22:13.240
I really feel for them because no girl could feel that inside them.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.240
Can you imagine?

22:15.240 --> 22:17.240
So, what's the point?

22:17.240 --> 22:21.240
One guy who I was dating just felt like a little twiglet.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.240
The good thing is that they're often really good at cunnilingus.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.240
And then you have to get special condoms

22:28.240 --> 22:32.240
because they're so small and it's just going to slip off otherwise.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.240
Do you actually get special condoms for them?

22:35.240 --> 22:37.240
You can, yeah.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.240
6.30am, day nine.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.240
Honestly adorable.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.240
I'm saying this about a pig.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.240
Oh, and they're very cute. It just made me happy.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.240
Today, the women face an arduous trek,

22:59.240 --> 23:02.240
seeking the beach where they want to build a permanent camp.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.240
What do you think, Jamie?

23:04.240 --> 23:09.240
Is it worth cracking these open to get a mouthful of coconut before we set off?

23:09.240 --> 23:12.240
No, no, it's too heavy. There's loads there.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.240
Oh, I really want a coconut. I'm so hungry.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.240
I'm so hungry, but someone's just said no.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.240
I want you to just take your backpack off and I'm going to give it to Jamie.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.240
It's a hard walk and you will find it difficult.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.240
With very little water for the trek,

23:27.240 --> 23:31.240
Abi and Belinda are especially concerned about PhD student Fran.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.240
I know she's not well, but she doesn't want to leave.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.240
It's really tricky, isn't it?

23:34.240 --> 23:36.240
She doesn't want to make a fuss and she doesn't want to stop this.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.240
I just want to leave the island.

23:37.240 --> 23:41.240
Five days ago, she collapsed and received emergency medical treatment.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.240
I'm really worried about Fran.

23:43.240 --> 23:47.240
Every time she tries to do something, she's feeling light-headed and dizzy.

23:47.240 --> 23:51.240
She's already passed out once due to low blood sugar,

23:51.240 --> 23:54.240
so clearly her body's not very good at adapting to the day.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.240
Shall we make you the bow carrier?

23:57.240 --> 24:00.240
It's actually the most important thing ever.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.240
Yes.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.240
I feel like the weakest person in the group,

24:03.240 --> 24:07.240
because everyone, even though they're really tired, they can keep going.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.240
As I've said before, I just feel like another mouth to feed.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.240
Guys!

24:13.240 --> 24:15.240
Oh, no! No! No!

24:15.240 --> 24:18.240
Havala is reluctant to leave Sage and Onion behind.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.240
Now is time, Gordon.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
Come out!

24:24.240 --> 24:25.240
OK, we'll just grab him.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.240
They're wild animals. They just need to be left alone.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.240
I wanted to try.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.240
We can't take the pits.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
Guys, we're going to Home Beach!

24:36.240 --> 24:38.240
Woo!

24:39.240 --> 24:42.240
Bye, Sage! Bye, Onion!

24:42.240 --> 24:44.240
Bye, dinner! Bye, lunch!

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
Look at us! We look like savannahs!

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
BOOM!

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
BOOM!

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
BOOM!

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
BOOM!

24:53.240 --> 24:54.240
BOOM!

24:54.240 --> 24:55.240
9am.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.240
The women depart for Home Beach.

24:57.240 --> 25:01.240
The last time they went into the jungle, they were lost for three days.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.240
We're going down, Lauren.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.240
This time, 25-year old nurse Lauren leads the way.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.240
Then we're just going to head on this ridge thing.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.240
Julie, how are you feeling?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
Fuck off!

25:16.240 --> 25:17.240
Fuck off?

25:17.240 --> 25:19.240
Yeah. That's how I'm feeling.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
Woo!

25:21.240 --> 25:26.240
After just half an hour, Becky's in trouble.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.240
Hold up, guys. I've just got a dry mouth.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.240
My water bottle allocation for the day is almost done.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.240
How's everyone doing?

25:34.240 --> 25:37.240
Energy level's zero.

25:37.240 --> 25:41.240
The move will eat into the women's fragile energy reserves,

25:41.240 --> 25:45.240
but it's a gamble they must take, whatever the consequences.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.240
Take five.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.240
I'm feeling so shit.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
If this rain keeps on going,

25:52.240 --> 25:55.240
I feel like I'm on the brink of collapsing again.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.240
I don't want to tell anyone cos I feel so pathetic.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.240
I know I can do this.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.240
I just need to keep going.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.240
With the group exhausted, Lauren and Fi volunteer to scout ahead.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.240
Anyone want a biscuit?

26:11.240 --> 26:14.240
Oh, my God! Oh, you bitch!

26:14.240 --> 26:18.240
Just a little biscuit. Just a little barbie biscuit.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.240
Oh.

26:20.240 --> 26:26.240
The advance party are pushing ahead through the jungle.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
I think we may have found it.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.240
We have! This is it!

26:31.240 --> 26:34.240
I know. This is our beach!

26:38.240 --> 26:41.240
Oh, my God. So excited.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.240
I feel a surge of energy.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.240
I can hear the sea!

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
Oh, wow!

26:48.240 --> 26:51.240
Wow! That is amazing.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
Woo!

26:53.240 --> 26:55.240
Woo!

26:55.240 --> 26:57.240
Woo!

26:57.240 --> 26:59.240
Look at that!

26:59.240 --> 27:03.240
Even in the pisto drain, this place looks ridiculous.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.240
I just think paradise compared to where we've been.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.240
The sea looks bluer. Everything looks better. Everything.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.240
Our pigs! The pigs!

27:12.240 --> 27:14.240
Yay!

27:14.240 --> 27:16.240
They've traipsed all that way after us.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.240
I don't know whether I could eat them now.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.240
Oh!

27:19.240 --> 27:20.240
Aw!

27:22.240 --> 27:24.240
Why the king? They love us!

27:29.240 --> 27:31.240
What the hell?

27:31.240 --> 27:32.240
Ketchup.

27:33.240 --> 27:37.240
I found a ketchup bottle, and I just think that's a sign.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.240
Mm-hm.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
Open ketchup.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
Ketchup.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.240
The journey has beaten Fran.

27:55.240 --> 27:59.240
This beach is extra cold because it's kind of, like, open.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.240
I don't feel like I can do anything in this weather

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
because I can't move.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.240
It's a little bit damp.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.240
Oh, thank you so much, hubby.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.240
Aw, I love you.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.240
Coming through the jungle again today,

28:11.240 --> 28:14.240
in pouring rain, has tipped her over the edge.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.240
She's been proper poorly. She's cold all the time.

28:17.240 --> 28:22.240
And so when we're cold, it's, for her, it's like bloody hypothermia.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.240
When you're wet, you're malnourished,

28:24.240 --> 28:27.240
your body temperature just is going to drop,

28:27.240 --> 28:29.240
and it only takes a two-degree drop

28:29.240 --> 28:33.240
to take you right bang into that danger zone for hypothermia.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.240
So the women have an uphill struggle getting Fran warm.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.240
I am on firewood duty.

28:40.240 --> 28:44.240
We need to get dry firewood.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.240
Nothing is dry.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.240
There's just no dry standing wood.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.240
It's not a little bit wet.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.240
Honestly, the place is just soddenly hoarse.

28:55.240 --> 29:00.240
I don't feel that I could cope with another rainstorm.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.240
I don't think I'm medically fit for this.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.240
It really is torture for Fran.

29:05.240 --> 29:09.240
She clearly is not a well person.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.240
I don't even have any sort of rescue meds,

29:12.240 --> 29:14.240
so if she were to collapse,

29:14.240 --> 29:18.240
it would take a while to get any further medical help to us.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
What's up, brother?

29:24.240 --> 29:27.240
Fran now feels she has no option.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.240
My body can't take it anymore. Over.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.240
Do you then want to kick off the island?

29:32.240 --> 29:33.240
Yes, please. Over.

29:33.240 --> 29:40.240
I hope you feel so much better, honey.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.240
I think you might have died if you stayed.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.240
And I'm serious.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
Thank you.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.240
I think I would as well.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.240
I am absolutely gutted.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.240
I absolutely love Fran.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.240
She's ace.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.240
She's our little baby.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
It was going to be my first challenge ever.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.240
But I, for myself, did.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.240
And I'm really gutted that I couldn't complete it.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
It's kind of heartbreaking.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.240
I tried so hard.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.240
Fran, bye, my darling.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.240
We love you.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
We love you.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.240
Another one down.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
Now we need to go and anchor the others to trees

30:18.240 --> 30:22.240
and make sure none of the others are thinking of leaving.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.240
To lose another team member, it's so demoralising.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.240
And you can just feel the atmosphere in camp at the minute

30:29.240 --> 30:31.240
is just on tenterhooks and everyone's thinking,

30:31.240 --> 30:33.240
I don't know how long I can keep going like this.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.240
Look at this shit.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.240
I know.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.240
What the hell's gone on?

30:42.240 --> 30:45.240
The storm and an extreme high tide

30:45.240 --> 30:47.240
have washed up a potential treasure trove.

30:47.240 --> 30:50.240
Like Paradise Beach, no longer.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.240
Oh!

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
Oh!

30:53.240 --> 30:55.240
False alarm, half a hair clip.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.240
Ta-da!

30:57.240 --> 31:00.240
Not only is it a can, it's a can with a lid.

31:00.240 --> 31:05.240
I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivors' arsenal

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
is resourcefulness.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
What's that?

31:07.240 --> 31:08.240
Is that iron brew?

31:08.240 --> 31:09.240
Oh, my God.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.240
Oh, my God.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.240
I thought it was iron brew.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.240
Oh, my God.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.240
Here, here, hold that, hold that.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.240
I thought it was iron brew.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.240
Oh, my God.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.240
Wait, check the cell by day.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
I don't care.

31:22.240 --> 31:27.240
Oh, my God.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.240
Oh, my God.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
Shh.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
Oh, my God.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
So powerfully sweet.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.240
So sugary, like, set up.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.240
And it was just heaven, absolute heaven.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.240
It actually just dropped on my tongue

31:43.240 --> 31:47.240
and it felt like ecstasy, absolute ecstasy.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.240
The women hope the wood is now dry enough

31:54.240 --> 31:56.240
to somehow light a fire

31:56.240 --> 31:58.240
to purify the water from a nearby pond.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.240
This is filled up good.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
Thank God for that.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.240
Yeah, for some reason.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.240
Thank God.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.240
Oh, my God.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
Oh, my God!

32:05.240 --> 32:06.240
It's usually on a fire starter.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
Woo!

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
Hang on, hang on.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.240
Hang on.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.240
Wait, hold on, we haven't lit a fire yet.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.240
This is, like, so early.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.240
Please don't go out.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.240
Please don't go out.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.240
To fucking wet.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.240
Shit, what are we going to do?

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
Oh, my God.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
Oh, my God.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
Oh, my God.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.240
Oh, my God.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.240
Oh, my God.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.240
Oh, my God.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.240
Oh, my God.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.240
Oh, my God.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
Oh, my God.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
Oh, my God.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
Oh, my God.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.240
Oh, my God.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
Oh, my God.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.240
Oh, my God.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
Shit, what we're going to do?

32:30.240 --> 32:31.240
Good work, Georgie.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.240
Nothing happens without a fire.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.240
We've got those things.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.240
It's, it's, it's...

32:38.240 --> 32:39.240
I can't believe how...

32:39.240 --> 32:40.240
It's an inverted triangle.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
Yeah.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
Fire.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
And everything comes off with a truck of fire.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
That's it.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.240
Without fire, we are...

32:49.240 --> 32:54.240
I don't have any survival skills, but I'm absolutely happy to step up to the plate if

32:54.240 --> 32:57.240
a crocodile needs killing, or...

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
Yeah.

32:58.240 --> 33:03.160
snake needs its head chopping off and I think the key to our survival on the

33:03.160 --> 33:09.220
island is teamwork I was actually caught in the tsunami in Sri Lanka we didn't

33:09.220 --> 33:12.940
eat or sleep for four days so I have an understanding of what that mental

33:12.940 --> 33:16.140
pressure is

33:18.200 --> 33:21.680
my stopping enough pressure on it I think I'm not putting enough pressure on

33:21.680 --> 33:25.600
it harder she tries Georgie can't get it to

33:25.600 --> 33:33.820
light even now the wood is drier sup Jules it's half past two now no sign of

33:33.820 --> 33:36.180
the fire

33:40.480 --> 33:51.700
he's had any spindle left is the thing it's probably right flicking off nice

33:51.700 --> 33:55.240
and slow that's it keep it like that the battle

33:55.240 --> 33:55.580
for an

33:55.580 --> 33:59.360
ember continues through the night

33:59.360 --> 34:04.940
getting a little bit panic we're starving and thirsty I surely I'm gonna

34:04.940 --> 34:10.320
die soon fucking stupid place the women have now been without water for more

34:10.320 --> 34:17.020
than 48 hours and they are dangerously dehydrated I feel really drained and

34:17.020 --> 34:20.360
really faint

34:20.360 --> 34:22.360
I'm dead

34:22.360 --> 34:27.360
okay to you Lauren

34:27.360 --> 34:28.360
me

34:28.360 --> 34:31.360
yeah me

34:31.360 --> 34:32.360
fucker

34:32.360 --> 34:33.360
it wasn't like that

34:33.360 --> 34:39.360
I think we've lost this one haven't we

34:39.360 --> 34:44.140
so this bow drill set really all the parts need to be in perfect proportion

34:44.140 --> 34:49.140
for this to work the problem is the women's drill is now too small because

34:49.140 --> 34:54.880
it's been so used they need to start again their situation is now beyond

34:54.880 --> 34:57.520
critical

34:57.520 --> 35:04.780
feel so dizzy it's fucking hard work when you've not drunk anything and the

35:04.780 --> 35:07.260
heat

35:07.260 --> 35:13.840
I'm really struggling it feels like a purpose on this island it's just to be

35:13.840 --> 35:16.840
dehydrated

35:16.840 --> 35:17.780
just to be dehydrated

35:17.780 --> 35:19.000
it's just a bit dehydrated

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I'm so tired.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Pot shot to barbell one, over.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
I just wanted to let you know we need some supplies from you.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Medical advice is that the castaways

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
are now so critically dehydrated that within a few hours,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
their lives will genuinely be in danger.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
So, really, I've got no choice but to intervene,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
and the women will be given a working bow drill set.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Right, fire startings, bitters.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Let's do this.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
It's purring, ladies, it's purring, actually.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh, yes!

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Yes! Woo-hoo!

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Woo-hoo!

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Well done!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
This is amazing, isn't it?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
This is great.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Woo!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Now we can start thinking about the bigger things,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
like our bellies, for example.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
There's a little something down there

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
which is sitting a bit dangerously close to the fire to me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
This is amazing.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
It's cool and clear.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
And that view, I feel like we're in a luxury hotel.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And then, shortly, our butler will come.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
What have you ordered for butler service?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Oh, oysters.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Oh, no, not oysters. We can get them here.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Oh, yeah!

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Order something you can't get here.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
What would be your first?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Double cheeseburger.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Absolute whopper with everything on it.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I want to find out what you...

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Now, what have you ordered from our butler?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
From our room service.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
I've started with some deep...

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Well, sorry, it is seafood, actually.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
No, really?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Some deep-fried calamari.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Deep-fried calamari.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Oh.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And then, for some weird reason,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
it's a bit like being pregnant,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
I want jelly and custard and ice cream.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And I don't even like ice cream.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
But I'd like, you know, jelly, custard and ice cream.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
And then, a kids' buffet.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Oh, kids' buffet. I'm with you with that.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Until I vomit.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Day 12 on the island.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
The women now have fire and plenty of drinking water,

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
but they're barely surviving on just 50 calories a day.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
It took me I don't know how many hours

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to get that many almonds.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
It's going to be one almond, if we're lucky.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
After almost two weeks without a meal,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
the group is at the point of starvation.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
If they don't eat soon, there's a genuine risk

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
their organs will start to shut down.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm fucking hungry.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
My tummy has gone away.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I literally have no tummy.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Look.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
My stomach's going, I'm going to have to eat myself.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
Is that not the cutest thing you've ever seen?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Hi, Sage and Onion.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
The fate of Sage and Onion hangs in the balance.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
The women have befriended them

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
and now can't agree whether or not

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
to eat them.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I keep looking at those gorgeous pigs

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
as bits of food.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
They're too cute.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
We can't, I can't.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Now, imagine this.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Barbecue sauce over the ribs, right?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, right?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Even the tail, really good, really chewy,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I'd still eat it.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I think we should spit roast it.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Put a steak up through its bum.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Not through its mouth, through its head, of course.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Obviously, I've got a completely different point of view

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
to the rest of the girls.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Because I don't eat meat, but...

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Sage and Onion, they're little peglets

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and definitely not eating none.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
We've got two pigs, Sage and Onion,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
which have become our pet pigs.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
They've followed us all the way from Coconut Beach here,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
which is a long walk for little legs.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They were thriving at the other beach.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
What's lacking here that they could get at the other beach?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
They were digging up lots of roots at the other beach.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It was really muddy,

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
so the water collected in the mud was in the sand.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Water doesn't really collect.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
We have to set a limit to how much we do

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
that compromises our resources over the pigs.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Over the past few days,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
people have been laid down with double vision,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
retching and not being able to walk.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
People are really suffering,

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
and you need to eat to survive.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Nobody wants to kill anything, but we need to eat.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Understandably, you know, a lot of people find the hard work,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
the whole concept of killing animals,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
it's either cruel, it's upsetting,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
but in a survival situation, when it comes down to the wire,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
it's a simple choice, them or you.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
You're really upset, everybody's really upset.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Can we show of hands that we agree that we do something soon?

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
So, Jamie, where's your mind thinking at the moment?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I don't want anything to do with this.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Well, who's going to kill it?

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Well, that's the next question.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
I have volunteered myself to do it...

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Well done, Lauren.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
..just because I know that I'll do it fast.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm going to get a little dehydrated, so I'll have a little drink.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
He's crying out more than he's taken it.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Oh, that's all right.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
You see, it was wrong to all get attached to them, wasn't it?

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
I always say, once you've named something, you're screwed.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
The reason I'm so upset

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
is because they reminded me of my dog.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
And...

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
..I really thought we were going to have some

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
until we left the island.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It makes everything real.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
It makes everything...

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
..like...

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
..raw.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
It's pretty raw, isn't it? Yes!

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It's raw.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
Erm, I just want to make it the most, like, peaceful...

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
..death.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
You know, like, if I was panicking,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
then it would feel that.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
If anyone sees a good whacker...

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I'm not annoyed at anybody.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I just don't want to have any part of it.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
As long as I don't see it or hear it,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
it just stops it.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Just gently holding out,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
cos I don't want him to struggle,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I just want him to be relaxed.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But I tell you what,

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
they've had a little better life than most pigs in captivity

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
that have bred to the pork.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
The pork we eat and the chops I buy

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
and the sausages I buy,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
they've had no life at all.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
I don't know another pig that's gone to bed with a load of people.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Ready? Should race.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Absolutely. Yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
One, two, three.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
THEY LAUGH

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Well, Lauren, absolutely amazingly well done.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
You did the job really, really well. Really well.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
It was quick. Quick.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
And it was painless.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
That was pretty emotional, wasn't it?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
It was pretty horrible.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It's never easy to take a life,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
but having learnt from this first kill,

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
they actually dispatched the second animal swiftly, cleanly,

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
no hesitation.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't distress.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Shall we get it back and get it on the barbecue?

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
I've never, ever killed an animal before,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
especially as a girl, as well,

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
is that I don't think we're designed to want to kill anything,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
and that's what has been a huge limit

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
on the burning curve for me.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
You know, it's reality.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
That's what it is, it's brutal reality,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
that if you want to eat,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
then you are going to have to kill something.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Gosh, Lauren, she's...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
She was the first to volunteer for the pig.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
She's very matter-of-fact, very hard-working.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Actually, if I could channel a little bit of Lauren,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
I'd be very happy, because she's very impressive.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
We needed something that was going to kick-start us

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
into not viewing animals as pets,

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
but rather as a way that is going to allow us to survive.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
You know, it's going to give us the energy that we need

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
to get hunting, get finding water, to find wood,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
because that is all exhausting work.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
It's very sad, but if I'm perfectly, perfectly honest,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm really looking forward to the meat,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
because I think we're all in dire need of a bit of a meal.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Harvey, just to let you know, the pig's on the fire.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I'm not being a hypocrite. I'll look later.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I'm just not ready. Thank you.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
There's no way I'm going to end here until it's all done with.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
I wouldn't go in there. I'm not eating a pig.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
This is a really decisive moment

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
in a women's struggle for survival.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
Now they have the mindset to progress as hunters and killers.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
They've actually crossed a very important cycle

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
and a very important psychological line,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
and for the first time, they're behaving like survivors.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Are you ready, guys?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
This tastes good.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Oh, my God. It's unbelievably delicious.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
I don't like the fact that I'm eating the piggy, but it is good.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like a wild animal.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
SHE LAUGHS

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Like a cavewoman.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Do you know what that tube is? It's a testicle.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I don't know. I quite like things like that.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Do you know what I mean? It's quite savage.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
We needed that.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I'm not going to lie.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
It was gorgeous.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Erm, I could have ate it all myself.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
It's all good.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
That's it for now. Over and out.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
Next time on The Island...

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
We're not even halfway through and tensions are beginning to fray.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
We're not all just grunts that bash on bits of wood.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
The sun would look like you didn't want to do a harder job.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I would say, fuck you to that person.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Fucking calm down, eh?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
