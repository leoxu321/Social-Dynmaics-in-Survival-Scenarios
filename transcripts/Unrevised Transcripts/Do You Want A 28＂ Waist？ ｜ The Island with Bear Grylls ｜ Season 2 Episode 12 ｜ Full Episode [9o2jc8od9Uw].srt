1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,940
Two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one has been inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:23,280
British men while a separate island was home to 14 British women they've been utterly alone

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:33,300
with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:45,780
themselves the women have made it off alive tonight it's a final installment of the men's

5
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,260
island you lazy bunch of bone idle bastards survival

6
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,580
will be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height and harsh tropical storm season this

7
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:09,760
island either wants to decompose you or eat you alive they'll have to find their own water and

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,260
hunt for their own food with the finishing line in sight have these modern-day men got what it

9
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,320
takes to survive I'm gonna go to hell for this

10
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:41,200
five weeks ago 14 British men were dropped on a remote Pacific Island

11
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,140
they've had some success with their fishing nets

12
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,140
but not enough to stop their physical decline

13
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:01,000
we've been here over a month now we are starting to starve be careful taking huge risks and the

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,800
pursuit of food holy he's severed one of his tendons the group suffered their biggest loss

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,640
he needs to be evacuated as 36 year old Will was forced to leave the island

16
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,080
I feel devastated he's gone of all the people he wanted to finish with he was up there wasn't it we

17
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,080
didn't finish strong as the team and now the islands thwarted that I hate this place I hate it

18
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
we're in again

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,860
no respite for us man

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,600
thunder we're getting screwed again

21
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:06,400
fair weather Islanders what's going on here oh I've got a flippings as a scorpion right don't move

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,660
don't move don't move I do not want to get stung of course you don't right please be quick about it

23
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,860
whoa let me get that way don't cut it off don't throw it off on your spot take it off take it off

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,780
give it a shot yeah ain't that the thing with this island one minute it's all calm and then

25
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:39,880
the men have been living on the island for an unprecedented 36 days and they're now entering

26
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,600
uncharted territory and that's why this time only the mentally strong are going to make it to the end

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,440
foreign

28
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:58,480
living for five weeks on an extreme low calorie diet consisting mainly of fish limpets and coconuts

29
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,820
the men have been getting weaker by the day pounds just keep dropping off gentlemen

30
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,940
to make sure their physical decline doesn't become life-threatening Dr

31
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,260
Piers has been monitoring their weight using scales from his medical kit come on you have a streak of

32
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,780
piss that puts me uh just under

33
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,200
Er, ten stone.

34
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
My bollocks weigh more than that.

35
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Jesus.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
28-inch waist.

37
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,920
28-inch waist.

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,080
Jesus Christ!

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
You could just buy boys clothes when you get home now.

40
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
If you have a flap suit, pack it.

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Baby gap, mate.

42
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,680
You could baby gap.

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Since arriving on the island,

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,440
the men have shed nearly 30 stone between them.

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
The weight loss was always going to be dramatic,

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,760
but I was not expecting it to be as severe as it was.

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,680
A maybe just maybe.

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,240
The storm has been kind and dropped us a fresh coconut.

49
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Determined to halt the decline,

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,080
the men redouble their efforts to find food.

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,640
We're going to go and check the shit out of these nets.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,840
Good luck, fellas.

53
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh, my leg is just not working today.

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,680
I had that yesterday, just...

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Have you worn your boots recently?

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,400
No.

57
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,040
Oh, God, dude, do not try putting them on, I tell you now.

58
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
Huh?

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh, it's a bit weightier than last time, isn't it?

60
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,400
The fishing nets have been a lifeline for the men,

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
but as they get weaker,

62
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,640
taking the raft out to check them

63
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,520
has become an increasingly difficult task.

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Come on, now, let's have just one or two.

65
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Oh, bollocks.

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Little snag.

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,080
Oh!

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Oh, this is getting annoying now.

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,480
Today, there isn't a single fish

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
to reward Charlie and Piers for their efforts.

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,440
You all right?

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,800
I think it's dangerous now, actually,

73
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
moving these nets, in all honesty.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
All of us are just skin and bone,

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,120
and it's not really...

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
I don't think it's safe any more.

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,160
We've eaten almost every single coconut on this whole island.

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
All the ones left are pretty much gone.

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,680
They're pretty much rotten.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,040
This was the last little stash I knew about.

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,000
Depleted a lot of the limpet stores already, really.

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,400
Even the men's once-reliable food sources

83
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
appear to be running dry.

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,440
We have truly decimated the fish

85
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,920
within three metres of the boundary of this island, haven't we?

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
24 hours ago, we were...

87
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
..conquering this island.

88
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,960
Nets were full of fish.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,320
24 hours later, we're in tatters.

90
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
This could go from bad to worse very easily.

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Every single one of these guys is going to have mega low moments.

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,560
It's just the reality of being out in the wild,

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,320
being tired, being bitten to death, being hungry.

94
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,640
You just have those moments.

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
And one of the key lessons I've learned is that the pain,

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,560
the discomfort, it never lasts forever.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
Keep your eyes on the light.

98
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,040
Can I just show you something?

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,720
There's something here that you might all want to see.

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Where is it?

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Come with me. It's not very far.

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,840
It's worth it, Sam.

103
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,160
Is it edible?

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
It's good.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm taking my knife, just in case.

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,360
It's Bear Grylls, isn't it?

107
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,680
And it's a hope as well.

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
Look at this.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Oh, yeah.

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh, baby turtle.

111
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,480
It's alive and it's making its way to the beach.

112
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,240
And if there's one,

113
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,200
there's probably a few more.

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
Isn't that amazing?

115
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,400
That's incredible.

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,400
There's the others. Look.

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,680
Oh, the other one. Oh, yeah.

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
Can you see the two of them?

119
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,840
Yeah.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh.

121
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,040
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

122
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,920
Privilege.

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,720
It's a real privilege, isn't it?

124
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I just noticed it.

125
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,920
I was coming back from the end of the beach.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,280
I just saw this thing wriggling in the sand and I thought,

127
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
what's that?

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
And just to see that, it's absolutely amazing.

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
This is such fire.

130
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,920
You can sort of see them toasting in the sun, can't you?

131
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,920
Yeah.

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,120
It's the life and death of these guys, you know what I mean?

133
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,040
It's like each one of us, you know,

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
whether it's here on this island or in life,

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,520
we're sort of fighting our own personal battles.

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Should we help him?

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,040
Come on, mate. Get out of that hole.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
Help him along.

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
Come on, chap.

140
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Go.

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
And maybe I'm doing a completely wrong thing

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
and...

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,880
Shoot me down, but if there's a chance of this little dude

144
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,680
living rather than dying,

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I want him to live.

146
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Go on, little fella.

147
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Take to the water.

148
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,600
God, that was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.

149
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
Really touching.

150
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,080
Those guys have just been born, they've just been hatched.

151
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
All they're thinking about is just surviving.

152
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,360
Getting to that water, it just puts everything into perspective.

153
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,320
Such a beautiful sight.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
This is what life is, really.

155
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
You OK?

156
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, yeah, tired, that's all.

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,040
The turtles have been a welcome distraction,

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,520
but after more than five weeks on a starvation diet

159
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,440
and no sign of their next meal, the men are in bad shape.

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,400
God.

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Tired.

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
Just tired.

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm so tired, just tired.

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,160
I've usually got lots of energy, and I like being enthusiastic about things.

165
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,560
I like doing things.

166
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,240
But I've been so tired.

167
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm sort of starving, wasting away, and I know my body is just like,

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,000
you need fuel, but there's no escaping it.

169
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,400
You're so aware that you're going downhill fast.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you all right?

171
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
No, he's gone, I think.

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,680
They're all fucking dying.

173
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,120
On the beach, some of the baby turtles are also on their last legs.

174
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,120
They're just frying up hot little bodies.

175
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,640
I wish they'd woken up at night.

176
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,680
It breaks my heart, but either we leave these little guys to rot

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,320
or for the birds to pick at them or we eat them.

178
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,600
And this, by any definition, is a moral dilemma.

179
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Are we definitely boiling these little birds?

180
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah.

181
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Little buggers up, are we?

182
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
What do you think?

183
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm not eating it.

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
No?

185
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I think it's disgusting.

186
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,840
I think you're all inhumane if you eat them, to be honest.

187
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,040
The turtle who died on the beach, there's rumours of that going in a broth,

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
and you could say for ethical reasons or whatever,

189
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,160
there's no way I'm drinking any of that at all.

190
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

191
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,960
Despite strong feelings in the group, Sam makes a decision.

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

193
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

194
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Eat, not eat.

195
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,400
I think we should eat them.

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,600
I think these guys are done.

197
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Are they all right?

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
I've got a hard-boiled egg.

199
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
Hates Christ, they're beautiful, aren't they?

200
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Oh, that's wrong.

201
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,640
That is so wrong.

202
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
I've eaten some fucked up shit in my time.

203
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
This takes a kick.

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,920
Salute, my little turtley friends.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,320
Best shell in all?

206
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,440
Yep, every bit.

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Raphael.

208
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Michelangelo.

209
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,400
Is there anyone else claiming these turtles?

210
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,120
Go on, then. Don't be shy.

211
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
I'll have two.

212
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Oh, my God, they're good.

213
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,360
They're absolutely stunning.

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,080
Are you eating them or not eating them?

215
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,560
I am not eating them, mate.

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
All right, OK.

217
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Weird how you can feel nothing for a snake or an iguana,

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and baby turtle has died anyway.

219
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,120
It's weird.

220
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Difficult to eat.

221
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,240
But I scoffed them down.

222
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
It is quite delicious.

223
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm sure it is, but a bizarre principle that I'm sticking to now.

224
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,520
With only half the group able to bring themselves to eat the baby turtles,

225
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,480
they bring little relief to the malnourished men.

226
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,080
It's becoming an experiment in starvation.

227
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
It's really tough to keep going when you're so hungry.

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,000
And the future looks pretty bleak when it comes to food.

229
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,000
The men have now been living alone on the island for more than five weeks.

230
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
It doesn't smell too good.

231
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Oh!

232
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Ah!

233
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Fuck!

234
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Ah!

235
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,680
Since the demise of their fishing nets, the food situation has become critical.

236
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,160
Resources on our back doorstep have run out.

237
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,160
A handful of dead baby turtles provided a temporary reprieve for some of the men.

238
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Whoa!

239
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,360
But today they're back to nothing.

240
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,200
About a week ago, we saw a baby turtle.

241
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,040
We saw pig-trotter marks, and we're keen to lay some pig traps.

242
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,600
And hopefully, we'll be able to bring back the bacon.

243
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,520
When you're deprived of food, it literally becomes all-consuming.

244
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
It's all you think about.

245
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,120
It's all that motivates and drives you, I need something.

246
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,560
But hard though it is when they're running on empty,

247
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,880
the men can't afford to neglect the other survival essentials

248
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,200
they've worked so hard to maintain over five weeks, especially team spirit.

249
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,720
We're on of the most draneling Chuck Santiago brothers

250
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Because I'm trying to find what they could get.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Come on, chefs.

252
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,360
That chap's is delicious.

253
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,800
Is that the obligatory pubic hair?

254
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,040
After an unsuccessful morning,

255
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,160
the only meal the hunting party have been able to muster is limpet broth,

256
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
which is quickly devoured by the men.

257
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,600
Mm.

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,600
MMM!

259
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
I think Phil's the biggest fool.

260
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,560
What have I missed?

261
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,360
The group's oldest member, Phil,

262
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,120
has arrived back in camp later than the others.

263
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,600
We all served up the food

264
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,480
and completely forgot about Phil.

265
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
What are you doing?

266
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Is there any driveway?

267
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,000
That'd be a negative.

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,320
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna hide behind my T-shirt.

269
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,160
Wow.

270
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I know that he doesn't sit on it.

271
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Does he need more than water now that he's...

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,200
It's the first time since the men arrived on the island

273
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,720
that they have forgotten to feed one of their own.

274
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,840
Everyone looked after themselves and forgot me.

275
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,520
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

276
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,960
That's OK. It just means that you all owe me.

277
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
That's all.

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,160
So, we weren't acting like this four weeks into the experiment,

279
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,120
but now we are...

280
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
We're coming up to five and a half weeks

281
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,000
and a lot of people are starting to fray around the edges.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
Some of them are fraying.

283
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,160
Some of them are coming away at the seams.

284
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
She didn't hear me.

285
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,280
What's he doing now?

286
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,760
I don't know.

287
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,520
He's wondering now.

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,720
I don't know.

289
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,200
Have you completely lost it?

290
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,040
I don't believe so.

291
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
I miss Phil.

292
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
OK, finally, let's get the fuck out of here.

293
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,120
That's it.

294
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,240
Enjoy.

295
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,440
We'll see you later on, mate.

296
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
Desperate for a decent meal

297
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,080
and having exhausted the resources close to camp,

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,680
Sam Brown and Kyle head off to look further afield.

299
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,960
Now we can go get some coconuts.

300
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
Fingers crossed.

301
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,440
For the first time,

302
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,800
they're heading to the unexplored south side of the island,

303
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,000
an arduous five-kilometre round trip across unforgiving terrain.

304
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Having set off at 4pm,

305
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,000
they have just two hours to make it there and back before nightfall.

306
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,400
We might have left this slightly late.

307
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
Guys, there's an iguana here.

308
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Where is it?

309
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,200
In the remaining hours of daylight,

310
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,000
the other men are doing their best to find a meal closer to home.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
Where is it?

312
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,400
It's in the fucking tree here. I'm pointing to it.

313
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,200
We're in a fucking forest. It's twirling.

314
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
It's a tree.

315
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,800
It's a tree.

316
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,480
12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, where are you standing?

317
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,000
Wow.

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,760
Fractures occurring in the group.

319
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,240
Wee arguments, bickering.

320
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,960
And that's got to be down to the hunger and the tiredness.

321
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
We haven't got a fucking clue where it is.

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,800
It's... I mean, can everyone see me?

323
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
If you can see me, I'm pointing at it.

324
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,400
Where is it?

325
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
It's down towards you, Barney. Barney, Barney.

326
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,000
It's going that way. It's going that way.

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,920
Yeah, I know. He's gone.

328
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,360
Back.

329
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Bollocks.

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,040
MUSIC PLAYS

331
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,920
MUSIC FADES

332
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,200
So are you struggling a bit, today?

333
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah, today has been a tough day, actually.

334
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,640
Sam and Kyle have now been trekking through dense jungle

335
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,560
for more than an hour...

336
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,280
..in an attempt to find out if the island's south coast

337
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,680
has any untapped sources of food.

338
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,040
Slippy as buggery here, Kyle, just be careful.

339
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,360
Cheers, mate.

340
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,800
This is going to be a fucking nightmare on the way back.

341
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,600
Thanks for that beat, chocolate.

342
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Mate, be careful. Be careful, be careful.

343
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,240
Be careful! Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful, mate!"

344
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Be careful.

345
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,600
This is a no-go.

346
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,080
We were hoping to find a nice sandy beach and a coconut tree.

347
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Instead...

348
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
..we find this.

349
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,760
Fucking lethal.

350
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
One slip up here and we'll die.

351
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
We'll die.

352
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
On the other side of the island,

353
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,040
farmer Charlie is the first to return to camp

354
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,840
after a fruitless day's hunting.

355
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,560
Oh, fucking hell!

356
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,520
I've come back to find the fire down to about one square inch of embers

357
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,320
after a month of constant burn.

358
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,920
We're getting a bit complacent now.

359
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
How much water's left?

360
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I don't know.

361
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, no.

362
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
You can see the standards of the camp are going lower and lower

363
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
because people are just starting not to give a shit any more.

364
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Kept this fire going for a month now.

365
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,240
There was no smoke coming out of that whatsoever.

366
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
There was an ember about an inch square.

367
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
But it was either, yeah, Barney, Phil, Roscoe...

368
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
That's not point fingers, it's not helpful.

369
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,480
..just saying it was either.

370
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
One of you five.

373
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
It cannot happen again.

374
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Most of the group have now been back at camp for the past hour,

375
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
but Sam and Kyle have yet to return from their expedition

376
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
to the south of the island.

377
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Are we worried about them, lads?

378
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
It's now pitch black.

379
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
It is, isn't it? Yeah.

380
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
It's not the ideal time to be out foraging.

381
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
My worry is, when you're in the middle of the jungle, in the dark...

382
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Yeah, you've got no navigation.

383
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
You've got a high tide as well, so you can't even get round.

384
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,240
This is the first time any of the men have failed

385
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
to get back to camp before dark.

386
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
With the weather worsening

387
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,240
and concerns growing over Sam and Kyle's safety,

388
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,240
the men muster a search party.

389
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Let's go. Let's try and find them.

390
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Ideal.

391
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Fucking sure we're going out at four o'clock.

392
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Yeah, they're certainly not equipped for a night out

393
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
in the fucking jungle on their own.

394
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

395
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
It's a very steep drop down here.

396
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Sam!

397
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Kyle!

398
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Sam!

399
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Kyle!

400
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
It's not looking good, man.

401
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,240
They would not find us here. Not a chance.

402
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
This is Kyle and Sam in the dark,

403
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
trying to trek back towards our camp.

404
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
We'll see how far we get.

405
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,240
With no sun in the sky, it's hard to get your bearings.

406
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Really, really unforgiving terrain.

407
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

408
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Charlie!

409
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Charlie!

410
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

411
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Sam!

412
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Try the bird.

413
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

414
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Oh, fuck.

415
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
This is fucking stupid.

416
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I feel tormented out here.

417
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

418
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Come on, boys!

419
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

420
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
SAM!

421
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Kyle!

422
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

423
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Having searched for an hour with no sign of the missing pair,

424
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
the group reluctantly head back to camp.

425
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
WHISTLE BLOWS

426
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Truth's known you want to get them and give them a clip

427
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
for being so stupid and putting us all through this

428
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
because the only thing they can do is have a look at the dog.

429
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
The dog is a dog.

430
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Oh, my God.

431
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Oh, my God.

432
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh, my God.

433
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Oh, my God.

434
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh, my God.

435
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Oh, my God.

436
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, my God.

437
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Oh, my God.

438
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Oh, my God.

439
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Oh, my God.

440
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Oh, my God.

441
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Oh, my God.

442
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,800
because the only thing we are going to be thinking now all night is how they say how are they i hope

443
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,840
they're okay familiarization makes you think that we've got it licked yeah that's what we've done

444
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,320
we ain't got nothing licked have we not mother nature in this island and bite you whenever she

445
00:21:47,320 --> 00:22:02,520
feels fit oh four rocks oh yeah desperately trying to get back to camp sam and kyle have

446
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,960
hit the treacherous stretch of coast where will had his accident this is getting dangerous

447
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
one wrong move here could easily prove fatal

448
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,880
now this next bit

449
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,120
you have to take it really really slow because

450
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,200
it's slippy as hell in the boulders and we've only got one head torch between us

451
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,960
i am genuinely shedding myself now

452
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,920
i genuinely don't think that they know where they are

453
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,240
it's a bit eerie actually

454
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,800
sometimes maybe i've seen one too many horror films i didn't think i was scared

455
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,960
of the dark but out here you have to sort of steal yourself that you're not scared of the dark

456
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,720
hello i see a light boys

457
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,240
sam good to see you man we are so pleased that you're back i don't think i've ever been so

458
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,840
massively relieved in my whole life well done boys glad to have you all well done boys

459
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:30,200
well done boys my pleasure the two prodigal sons returned thank god they're back home safe and sound

460
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,560
the other side of the island is just horrible it's all sheer cliff yeah the waves hitting it like

461
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,800
it's going to sit down sorry listen sorry to keep you guys up for so long anyone but we got back

462
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,160
that's what counts well the past few days have taken the whole island off its way into the sea

463
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,840
whole group really to their limits both physically and mentally not only have

464
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,680
they forgotten to feed people and neglected the essential tasks of fire

465
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,680
and water but their recklessness brought the group close to losing two more men

466
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,660
if they don't start looking after each other thinking smart being resourceful

467
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,040
and surviving then got a cat's chance the whole thing for me all comes down

468
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,840
to that's getting complacent yeah about everything thinking that we're we're now

469
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,080
starting to own this island a little bit when really we have shit we took

470
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,440
control that comes down to slipping off rocks running out of wood which will

471
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,500
blatantly do tomorrow yeah whatever it may be let's just get our drills a

472
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,480
little bit back in order yeah let's get back with morning morning calls and

473
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,280
stuff like that let's get back into them because we're all fucking show you the

474
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,940
minute so let's get the basics right yeah it would be vulgar to finish in

475
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,520
such a weak way we are here and we have grown so close together that we go for

476
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,600
it

477
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,640
doing the things we want to do that are exciting and fulfill all them things

478
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,020
we've always wanted to whip since being here let's go for it let's do this chaps

479
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,800
come on I don't want to finish week when I finish strong catch some pigs catch

480
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,200
some animals finish this adventure the way we want to I'm not going out like a

481
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,280
wet fart I want to go out strong

482
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,520
mum and dad

483
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:25,460
there's so much I want to tell you because I just wanted to say being here

484
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,900
has made me realize just how much I love you all

485
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,240
I don't want you to be worried about me in any sense and the reason I'm being

486
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,720
kind of a little bit nearly tearful it's because I just can't wait for the next

487
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,320
for that moment to see you all.

488
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,640
But I'm having the time of my life.

489
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,480
I really am.

490
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,160
I hope, I hope, it's off to a good go.

491
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,380
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

492
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,340
Early morning.

493
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,720
After a difficult day yesterday,

494
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,500
the men are determined to redouble their efforts

495
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,420
and leave the island on a high.

496
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I'm amazed what washes up on these damn beaches.

497
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,580
A snake.

498
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,680
Should I get a machete?

499
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Nice shot.

500
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,600
Come on.

501
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
It's so funny, because on day one,

502
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,080
we would be like, oh shit, there's a snake.

503
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,540
And now we're like, oh, it's just another snake.

504
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,380
Roar!

505
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,420
Today, I really got a sense that our teamwork,

506
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,720
our team ethic really came back.

507
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,660
It just seems to be a real pulling together today.

508
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,080
Woo!

509
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Man, he caught a whopper.

510
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,540
We've got fish!

511
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,380
Holy shit!

512
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,880
Hello, hello, hello.

513
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,720
Oh, what a night.

514
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,540
Oh, that is it.

515
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,920
It's a beauty as well.

516
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,800
Never in my life have I made my own sashimi before.

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,420
I've gone from eating one fish maybe every six months

518
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,180
to now having it raw on a beach, on a home-whittled table,

519
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,300
and loving it.

520
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,340
Dig in. To you, sir.

521
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,340
To many, to many more days like this.

522
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,800
Oh.

523
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
Mm.

524
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,840
That is just so...

525
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,420
Succulent in the justice, does it?

526
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
Fresh.

527
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
It's delicious.

528
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,420
One of the things I want to see in this experiment

529
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,720
is whether these guys can use all their collective resources

530
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,500
and brains and muscles to not just survive,

531
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,720
but to really thrive, to build community,

532
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,220
to have fun, to work out efficient sources of finding food,

533
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,720
to, you know, to really start to thrive

534
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,920
and separate us from the animals.

535
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,640
When Oinky makes his way to my front door,

536
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,720
I will consume the entire fucking animal.

537
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
The men's renewed spirit has brought fresh optimism

538
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,260
about the prospect of catching a meatier meal.

539
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,480
Ah.

540
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,600
What have we got here?

541
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,720
These look like little trotter mack's to me.

542
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Oh, my fucking God.

543
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
That is exciting, isn't it?

544
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
We're going in the bushes, so, obviously,

545
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,720
it's a bit too hot for them, and then going back in.

546
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
They're definite pig trunks.

547
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Please.

548
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Oh, my God, bacon patties.

549
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Oh!

550
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
We were all fantasising the other day

551
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
about what we're going to do to Oinky.

552
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Delusions of grandeur, of smoking him,

553
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
and putting him on a spit, and having crackling, and...

554
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
God knows all sorts what we'd give for that.

555
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Damn, it's warm, Barney.

556
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
It's getting hot, mate, isn't it, eh? Yeah.

557
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Further down the beach,

558
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Vik, Barney and the two Sams

559
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
are also on the hunt for a decent supper.

560
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Shit the dog. Shit the dog.

561
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
What? Look at that. Look at that.

562
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
There's something there. Stop, stop, stop. Don't move.

563
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Where, where, where? OK, stop.

564
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Black pig, black pig. There's a pig in there. No way.

565
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Don't move, don't move. Vik, Vik, don't move.

566
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Let's have a think about this. OK.

567
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
He was just having a little snooze in the shade,

568
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
so we need to get behind him,

569
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
cos he's going to disappear straight in there.

570
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
I'll go up the sand. I'll go with you, then, yeah? Yeah.

571
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Don't you worry. We'll hold him down.

572
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
If I'm eating pig tonight, I'll fight the bastards.

573
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Just keep very calm.

574
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,720
When cornered, pigs can be incredibly aggressive animals.

575
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
This thing is going to run like stink.

576
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,720
They've got razor-sharp tusks and a vicious bite.

577
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
I'll go up to him and then...

578
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
There's a pig.

579
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
There's an other pig.

580
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
No!

581
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,120
Get in!

582
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,040
Holy shit, Barney! Sorry, Barney!

583
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,280
Woo!

584
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
Woo!

585
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,680
I thought he was going to turn and bite me. I crapped myself.

586
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,320
Yeah, he's gone.

587
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,880
Gosh, that was so much quicker than I thought.

588
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
That was just like...

589
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,080
Listen, it's done. This is how we roll.

590
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,840
I wasn't expecting you to stab him.

591
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,760
I didn't expect you to stab him at all.

592
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,040
I did. Mate, that would kill you.

593
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,520
That would hurt. That would fuck you up.

594
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah.

595
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,560
This is a fucking adult pig.

596
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
This is like a hog, isn't it?

597
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,240
These things wreck people.

598
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,000
Jesus, look at that tusk.

599
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,760
That would go through to bone, wouldn't it?

600
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, yeah.

601
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,920
Six weeks ago, I would have been very slow to draw a knife

602
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
and ram it into a large mammal's throat.

603
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,440
Now, I didn't even think, I didn't even hesitate.

604
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
Oh, easy peasy.

605
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,560
OK. Yeah.

606
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh, there's going to be so much meat on that head.

607
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,680
In 21st century Britain,

608
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,960
I think we're so used to getting

609
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,680
all of our meat pre-packaged off a supermarket shelf.

610
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,040
And in many ways, we've kind of lost touch

611
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,680
with actually where it comes from.

612
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,480
Meat on his legs, ribs, back legs, a lot.

613
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,040
Many people understand we find the whole idea of killing an animal,

614
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,920
they find it either cruel or definitely upsetting.

615
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
And, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,

616
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,200
but in a survival situation, when it comes down to it,

617
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
it's a simple choice.

618
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,200
Them or you.

619
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Nose to tail,

620
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,960
we're going to eat every piece of you, Mr Pig.

621
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
I can see home from here, boys.

622
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,560
I don't believe it.

623
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
I don't believe it. It cannot be a trotter.

624
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,400
Woo!

625
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Boys!

626
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,720
Ain't done this thing, eh?

627
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,840
Yes.

628
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,320
Well done, boys.

629
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
OK, three, two, one, go.

630
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,200
Oh, Mr Piggy.

631
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
That was hard work.

632
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Yeah?

633
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,120
And you've already got me big, good in there.

634
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,080
Oh, that is great.

635
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,640
Absolutely brilliant, isn't it?

636
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, get in there.

637
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,840
A pig of this size, weighing up to 200 pounds,

638
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,600
contains tens of thousands of calories

639
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,520
and could feed the ten men for the next few days.

640
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,960
I think there's a lung there.

641
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
Yeah, you don't want to eat lung.

642
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,600
Oh, we're going to have pork belly.

643
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
God, that is like barbecue food.

644
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,200
Yeah.

645
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,400
Has anybody got any preference about who's served first today?

646
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,880
I would say Phil.

647
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,600
Yeah, great job, good luck.

648
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
After the group forgot to feed Phil yesterday,

649
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,320
by way of an apology, they give him first dibs on the spoils.

650
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
I'm having a meat orgasm.

651
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,960
Which one's the kidney?

652
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Anyone that knows me will know one of my favourite meals is liver and bacon.

653
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,000
Guess what that is?

654
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Liver.

655
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh.

656
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,240
And then to add to that, kidney.

657
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,560
That beats any crocodile, any fish, anything I've had on this island.

658
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,120
I don't know what you're saying.

659
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,280
The pig is the men's first taste of meat in weeks

660
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,080
and nothing is going to waste.

661
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,680
I think that's testicle-y.

662
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
I'm going to eat everything of this pig.

663
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,040
I'm even going to eat it.

664
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,160
It's little Willy.

665
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
I'd eat some pig penis.

666
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,480
That's a very unique flavour in there.

667
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,840
Does that taste like dick?

668
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,560
Yeah. Yeah, it is dick.

669
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,240
It worries me quite a lot that you know what dicks taste like.

670
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,880
Vic! Yeah?

671
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,480
I think we're raising the sign, mate.

672
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,520
After surviving on the island for almost six weeks,

673
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
the men have decided to make a tribute

674
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,000
to their achievement.

675
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,640
Gentlemen, by the power invested in me,

676
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,640
I name this camp the Croc and Trotter.

677
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,120
The Croc and Trotter!

678
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm really looking forward to this ending

679
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,000
and looking back and just saying,

680
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
wow, I did that.

681
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,080
I accomplished...

682
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,560
I succeeded.

683
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,240
We conquered the island.

684
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,120
We're named and ready to rock.

685
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,840
Shall we play toss the caber?

686
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,960
Yeah!

687
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,520
First game, let's go.

688
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,160
Three, a two, a one, toss my caber.

689
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,960
Come on, Charlie.

690
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,480
Man!

691
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,040
Oh, no!

692
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,600
That's it!

693
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,680
Go!

694
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,640
Yay!

695
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,360
One!

696
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Not bad, son!

697
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,360
Not bad!

698
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,360
Yeah!

699
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,280
It's the first time that the whole group,

700
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,680
as we let our hair down,

701
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,440
are not worried about water or wood or survival

702
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,120
or will we eat or will we not.

703
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,400
It's kind of like, let's just get together as lads and have fun.

704
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,880
I wish, looking back, I wish we'd done more of it.

705
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,400
That's one of the highlights of our entire time here.

706
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,480
Oh!

707
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
Beautiful!

708
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,480
Go, go, go, go, Vic!

709
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
No, Charlie!

710
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,480
Oh, no!

711
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,480
Oh, no, no!

712
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Oh, no!

713
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,480
Oh, yes!

714
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,480
One nil!

715
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,160
Yes!

716
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,440
What I have experienced many times in the wild

717
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,560
is an incredible sense of achievement

718
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,160
that is very hard to get in everyday life.

719
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Catch it!

720
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,320
Oh!

721
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,600
And I think when you battle for seven or eight hours

722
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,280
in a torrential rainstorm with just a couple of sticks to make a fire,

723
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,200
you've got to look for opportunities, however small, to have fun.

724
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
Yeah!

725
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,720
It's almost like nourishment, but for the soul.

726
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
Take the string!

727
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
Take the string!

728
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,200
Yes!

729
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,520
Call it a draw!

730
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,520
A draw, yeah!

731
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
A draw!

732
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,320
I feel amazing.

733
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I feel relaxed, I feel empowered,

734
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,120
I feel like we're masters of this island.

735
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll treasure this moment.

736
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,080
I really, really will.

737
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,760
This is what the island's all about.

738
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,080
This and a handful of other moments.

739
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,040
This feeling.

740
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,480
I hope we'll get to see it.

741
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I hope I never forget it.

742
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Well, here we are.

743
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
We are at the end of this magnificent, magnificent journey.

744
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Overwhelming sadness that I miss my wife and kids so much.

745
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Not so much sadness, just,

746
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
God, how long can this truly go on for?

747
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Er...

748
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
Yeah, I'd like to see them soon, if possible.

749
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Some of it better for me, some of it better.

750
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
What do you think of that beauty?

751
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Shit. There it goes.

752
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Look, look, look.

753
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Ooh, there's some heat off this bad boy.

754
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Look at this!

755
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Look at that goal!

756
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Didn't take long, did it?

757
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Ocean's Elevenses.

758
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
This is our last night on the island.

759
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Yeah!

760
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Yes!

761
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Yes!

762
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Yes!

763
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Yes!

764
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Yes!

765
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Good!

766
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Best night so far?

767
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I think so.

768
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Has to be, doesn't it?

769
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Awesome.

770
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Love it.

771
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Home's within spitting distance.

772
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Really enjoying it.

773
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Everyone's spirits are really high.

774
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Wow.

775
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,480
The men have now survived on the island for 40 days.

776
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Would you guys like to hear a little Ravi Varan's poem that I wrote this morning?

777
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.

778
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.

779
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Yes, I'd love to.

780
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Dear islands, our islands, this new family does hail.

781
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,480
As you've chucked every last, but nobody has failed.

782
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,480
On the contrary, dear islands, as our stay grew longer,

783
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
we may have reduced in numbers.

784
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Holy shit!

785
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
But we've grown ever stronger.

786
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
For six long weeks,

787
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,480
we've battled hunger, tides, exhaustion, the weather.

788
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
But with British Bulldog spirit,

789
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
She floats!

790
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
we triumphed with heart, soul and endeavour.

791
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Holy shit!

792
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,480
You've been cruel, uncomfortable and brutal to us all.

793
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
With freezing rain, dangerous seas and rocks that make us fall.

794
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Holy shit!

795
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,480
You have dangerous beasts that can kill, maim and maul.

796
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
This is a scorpion.

797
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,480
But we baited, trapped, killed, cooked and ate them all.

798
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Oh, delicious. So good.

799
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,480
But dear islands, our islands, we will never forget

800
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,480
the incredible journey we've shared since our new family met.

801
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,480
So the question is, our islands, can British blokes survive?

802
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Get the fucking camera off!

803
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
The answer is no, dear islands.

804
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
We didn't just survive, but thrive.

805
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Excellent.

806
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Oh, my God, look at her go!

807
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Wow!

808
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,480
So I'm on my way to pick up the men after six weeks, you know,

809
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,480
and to be honest, I'm pretty nervous just about what I'm going to find.

810
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,480
You know, are they going to be emaciated wrecks

811
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
or are they going to look pretty healthy?

812
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
You know, are they going to be broken men

813
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,480
or will they have figured out how to survive and thrive?

814
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
It is quite strange, though, isn't it?

815
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
What bit?

816
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
It's finished.

817
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Yeah, yeah.

818
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Within an hour, we'll step off and never be able to get out.

819
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,480
We'll step off and never, ever step back on.

820
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
For it has been an honour serving you, gentlemen.

821
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Yes, see you here.

822
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Good effort, gents.

823
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I feel quite proud of our little gang.

824
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,480
The island has taught me an incredible sense of unity

825
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,480
and we've shared, we've shared everything that we've had here on this island.

826
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
It doesn't matter if it was the smallest fish,

827
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
we've shared it between everyone.

828
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I feel...

829
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
..thrilled to have made it this far

830
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
with you all.

831
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
It sounds fucked up,

832
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,480
but I feel like I'm going to actually miss you lot.

833
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I think I'm leaving the island with a renewed sense of confidence

834
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
and some friends.

835
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Some more friends, should I say.

836
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Here we go, boys.

837
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Don't worry.

838
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Here he is.

839
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes!

840
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Come on, lads.

841
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
This is our man.

842
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
This is it, lads.

843
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
It's Bear Grylls.

844
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Very good, lads.

845
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
It's only Bear Bloody Grylls.

846
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
It's only Bloody Dunnets.

847
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,480
It's only Bloody Dunnets!

848
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Bloody Dunnets!

849
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
Wow.

850
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Look at you guys.

851
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
I thought I smelled bad.

852
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work.

853
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Yeah, glad to see you.

854
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Thanks for coming back.

855
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I'm glad I made it to the end.

856
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,480
I am super, super, super glad I made it to the end.

857
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Well done, you guys.

858
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Wow.

859
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
It's like you've been through a war zone.

860
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
But those smiles tell a story.

861
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
So how are you feeling?

862
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Fantastic.

863
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Glad to see you now.

864
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Yeah.

865
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Glad to see you.

866
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,480
As a band of brothers, it's not a band of brothers anymore.

867
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
It's a family.

868
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Love them and hate them.

869
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
They're here forever with you.

870
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
And it was fantastic.

871
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
So we're going to get you off the island.

872
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
One last thing you guys want to do?

873
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Yes.

874
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Woo!

875
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Come on, boys.

876
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Come on, guys.

877
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Kyle, you started this fire.

878
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
You tell us when to end it, pal.

879
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm proud to say that I've made it here with you guys.

880
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Ocean's 11ters.

881
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Let's quench the fire.

882
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Quench the fire, guys.

883
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Woo!

884
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Woo!

885
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Woo!

886
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Woo!

887
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
Woo!

888
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Woo!

889
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Woo!

890
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
Woo!

891
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Woo!

892
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Woo!

893
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Woo!

894
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Woo!

895
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Woo!

896
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Woo!

897
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Woo!

898
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Woo!

899
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Woo!

900
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Woo!

901
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Woo!

902
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Woo!

903
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Woo!

904
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Woo!

905
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Woo!

906
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Woo!

907
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Woo!

908
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Woo!

909
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Woo!

910
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Woo!

911
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Woo!

912
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Woo!

913
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Woo!

914
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Get in there.

915
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Yes?

916
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I think what's interesting is that you realize they've actually

917
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
become a really tight unit.

918
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
You know, that's why there's emotion at the end when they're

919
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
hugging each other, because they've been through the fire

920
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
together, and have come out of it stronger.

921
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Well done, boys.

922
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Let's go, boys.

923
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Let's go, boys.

924
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:31,820
If I got that chance again, give me about a year or half a year, I'll do it again.

925
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,240
But if you ask me to do it tomorrow, I'll probably tell you to piss off.

926
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,860
Just because you're over 40, just because you're over 50, just because you're almost 60, doesn't mean you're spent.

927
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,380
A can-do attitude goes a long way in this life.

928
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,780
Is that Will? Is that Will?

929
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,940
That's William!

930
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,300
That's him in this!

931
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:34,160
Oh, that's so good.

932
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,280
Wow, you all stink!

933
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,780
I couldn't let you guys get to the end without me.

934
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Hello, is that you?

935
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,900
Hi, I'm fine, you?

936
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,660
It's absolutely brilliant, babe.

937
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,540
Oh God, your voice is beautiful.

938
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,200
Hello?

939
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:05,840
Hello?

940
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,240
Hello?

941
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,460
Is that Bobby?

942
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,800
Yeah.

943
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,740
Oh, Bobby!

944
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,400
Bobby, I need to hear from you.

945
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,040
It'sông

946
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:33,320
It's provided a look at overall.

947
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,220
You know, they've built community, they have learnt have compassionate and a care for each other.

948
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,880
A respect for each other, they've worked their nuts off.

949
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,880
They've understood the heart of survival isn't about knowledge.

950
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,720
It's about embracing failure, making mistakes and never giving up.

951
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,900
And that's why, at the end of it, what I've done is inspiring.

952
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,360
they've gone through a journey together and come out of it stronger tighter and

953
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:03,300
it's why they've learned the beginning of a mastery over this environment

954
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,580
they can call themselves survivors they've earned it the hard way

955
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,540
you
