1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,760
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,620
utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:38,400
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:48,600
strength the winds a day prehistoric animal who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,620
follow the men's on

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,060
this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:08,000
they'll have to endure the height and harsh tropical storm season nature I say this is

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,400
the worst you can do they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,700
you lazy bunch of bone idle have these Monday men

11
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:22,740
and hunt for their own food you lazy bunch of bone idle bastards have these Monday men

12
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,740
got what it takes to survive

13
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:33,480
that's the artistry

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:48,540
four days ago I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote Pacific Island

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,420
they're beaten next to nothing limpets horrendous and up three days a brutal

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,020
tropical storm the group began to fracture what is the matter with you

17
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,980
nothing a matter with me so leaving three people threatening to walk off the

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,540
island I cannot face another day on you I'm not gonna make the rest of the time

19
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,480
I've been having a lot of until I heard one of my teammate so they wanted me to

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
It's just being a prick.

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Bollocks, absolute bollocks. I'm not having it.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
I am going off this island

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,480
because I'm not being held responsible for that.

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,480
22-year-old graphic designer Joe, builder Andy

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
and now construction manager Paul

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,480
are all threatening to leave the island.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
It's affected you more than I thought it would have.

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
I came here to get away from shit like this,

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
not deal with it every day.

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So we are three men down in one day

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
when the odds are against us at the moment,

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
and without a full complement of people,

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
we're going to really struggle.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
You just made this survival thing probably twice as hard.

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
OK, slightly less practically, guys.

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,480
We've stood here and talked for an hour.

37
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
If it really is going to be 11 of us today,

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
us 11 have got a lot of work to do

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
to get through the rest of the day,

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
so if you guys are not prepared

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
to commit to the rest of the group,

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
boom, go.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Sweet.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
I've made a decision. I've had enough.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I want to go now.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Basically, we've realised that a candlelit dinner

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,480
and a glass of wine is a bit better than being here.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Look, we knew it was never going to be easy,

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
but it's not the survival bit that's got to me.

50
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
It's just all bullshit.

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
I think that's genuinely shitty.

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
I think that's walking away and leaving the rest of us

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
and letting the rest of us die in a big way.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Not only is it a selfish thing to do,

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I think it's the most selfish possible time you could go

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
when, like, all hands are needed.

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,480
With Paul having made a definitive decision to go,

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
the group are hoping that other builder, Andy,

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
will now change his mind about leaving.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Don't leave because of someone else.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,480
If he's gone anyway, stay and get amongst it.

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
How can I possibly stay, man,

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
when a guy was leaving because of me?

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
If you had left, he would have still gone.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Andy, if you stay, you can accomplish six things at a time

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
instead of five.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
You'll just be a jerk.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
I'll stay.

69
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll stay.

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
I'll stay.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I'll stay.

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I'll stay.

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
That's nice.

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Awesome.

75
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Well done, Andy.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I'll stay.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah!

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
APPLAUSE

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Good boy, Andy.

80
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
That was a good boy, Andy.

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
That's really...

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm really pleased about that.

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
It's less worry.

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
And it's a heartache to see the others go,

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
but you know what?

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
We're stronger.

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
We're stronger with 12 and 11.

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
FANS ROAR

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
FANS ROAR

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
FANS ROAR

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
FANS ROAR

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
FANS ROAR

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
FANS ROAR

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
FANS ROAR

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,400
As the weather breaks, Paul uses the emergency satellite phone

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
to request his evacuation, along with Joe.

97
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,540
This is Paul. I would like to come off of the island.

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,860
It's either me or one of the others go,

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,260
and I don't want me to be used as a scapegoat,

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,020
so I believe I am stronger than that person

101
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,280
and wouldn't regret this decision.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
It's going to make everything so much harder.

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,900
We've not been here for five minutes, really.

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,040
And we're losing two members of the team.

105
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm a happy man.

106
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,960
I want to be a happy man with a tub of Pringles and a Mars bar.

107
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,000
You can only encourage them so much

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
before you end up spending a third of your day

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
encouraging somebody not to leave.

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,400
That could be better spent time getting the things we need.

111
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,000
Water, fire, shelter, food.

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Having lost valuable time,

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,900
the priority for the 12 remaining men

114
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,800
is to finish a shelter before another storm hits.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,860
We are running on empty,

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,580
but we are being stubborn and persistent.

117
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,180
Fortunately, Andy decided to change his mind about leaving.

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,540
At this point, there's still so much to do.

119
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,040
We need all hands on deck,

120
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,780
so losing three people would have been a massive blow.

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
Right, Piers, I'm off.

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,940
You're off, mate.

123
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,820
Well done, mate.

124
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,740
See you again, eh?

125
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah, see you, Ben and Blasey.

126
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,940
We're looking to go.

127
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,260
I'd turn round and shake your hand, mate,

128
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
but we're...

129
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
No, it's fine.

130
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Yeah, I'll...

131
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
We're sort of structurally integral at the moment.

132
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
See you later.

133
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I don't want to spoil fun, gents,

134
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,260
but is there any possibility you could step out of the area

135
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,260
while we just start running these struts across?

136
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Continue your conversation just sort of ten feet over there.

137
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Andy!

138
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,260
He didn't even acknowledge me.

139
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Did he not? No.

140
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I didn't even turn around and say,

141
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
''Dicky bird.''

142
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,260
Unbelievable.

143
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Spineless wonders.

144
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Fucking hell, lads, what were you thinking?

145
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,260
What were you possibly thinking?

146
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Just before we came out here, I bought a brand of golf.

147
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Mate, it's wild.

148
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Oh, it's beautiful.

149
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
500-pound wheels.

150
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Lovely view, though, innit?

151
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,260
After just five days on the island, 14 men are down to 12.

152
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
It was a bit emotional,

153
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
saying goodbye to everyone.

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Yeah, of course it was.

155
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
But...

156
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
I mean, in a short time we've been here,

157
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
it would make quite a strong bond, but...

158
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

159
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Now the dead weight's fucked off, let's get on with it.

160
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
Ain't got the time to it.

161
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
We've got to build a fucking house for tonight.

162
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,260
When people leave a survival group,

163
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
the positive thing is that what it does,

164
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,260
it galvanises those that remain,

165
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,260
making them even more determined that they can survive.

166
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
The new group may be less in number,

167
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
but it will be greater in strength.

168
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,260
No, genuinely, I can't believe that after five days

169
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
we're down to 12 people.

170
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
It is a shock, innit? Come on.

171
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
It's a massive shock.

172
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
I mean, do you think you'll stick it?

173
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Yeah.

174
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
The whole thing?

175
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Yeah, I've got no doubts about that, yeah.

176
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
We've been talking about for the last kind of two days, really,

177
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
that it would be a great shame if anybody left.

178
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
But I now think we need to look at it positively.

179
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,260
And as harsh as it is, perhaps we've streamlined, actually,

180
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
and more determined.

181
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
I think those who've stayed, you know,

182
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
have showed a certain determination.

183
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
We've got no personality clash this morning.

184
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Personality clash is now in the camp.

185
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
Everybody gets along, everybody really likes each other.

186
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
We're going to have some really good bonds out of this,

187
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,260
not only the achievement of doing it, which we will,

188
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,260
and a new friendship is going to develop between us all.

189
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Teamwork makes the dream work, Vic.

190
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Yes, it does, sir.

191
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Stop staring at my sexy bottom, though.

192
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
It's upsetting me.

193
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,260
I could feel your eyes penetrating my underpants.

194
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Morale in camp has lifted,

195
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
but events of the past

196
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
few days have taken their toll.

197
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Oh, I'm absolutely connected.

198
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
The men have barely eaten since they arrived

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
on the island some five days ago.

200
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,260
I do feel like we're staring down the barrel a little bit.

201
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,260
We're going to have to pull something out of the bag

202
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,260
or go very, very hungry, it seems to me.

203
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,260
Are we not wise to have a real good recce of the island?

204
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,260
There's going to be wildlife somewhere around that rocky bit.

205
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Yeah. There's got to be.

206
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,260
We need to really go through the interior of this island

207
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
to find out what's living where.

208
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
We could come across lights,

209
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,260
you drive in the country and you see all of a sudden

210
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,260
a field full of rabbits because they love a certain area.

211
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Yeah.

212
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
It might be exactly the same with your goaties,

213
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
exactly the same with the lizards.

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
I think it's a really, really good shot, Vic.

215
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Come on, boys.

216
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,260
5am the following morning, the hunt for food begins.

217
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,260
No heroes today.

218
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,260
We don't want anyone to lose their leg or arm.

219
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
You've got your stick there, haven't you, fella?

220
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
I've got a stick.

221
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
I'll grab a stick if you need one.

222
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Are we going to dance first? A hunt dance?

223
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
We have an alpha male in our family.

224
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
Obviously, in my house, I'm it.

225
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
The dogs know I'm in charge.

226
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
My wife lets me think I'm in charge.

227
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
My kids look up to me as if I'm in charge.

228
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Alpha male, you know what I mean?

229
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
I'm Johnny Wise Muller.

230
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I'm the alpha male.

231
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
I'm Tarzan.

232
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
I'm all them things.

233
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
I'm looking forward to being able to know that I can,

234
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,260
come the zombie apocalypse or whatever world issue will befall us,

235
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,260
that if push comes to shove, I could still provide for my family.

236
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
My dream is for them guys to go,

237
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
''That's my dad, that. That's fantastic. My dad did that.''

238
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Iguanas live up trees, is that right?

239
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, keep your eyes absolutely peeled.

240
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Shit, I wish I had my glasses.

241
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,260
To ensure that these guys have a fighting chance of surviving,

242
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,260
I've made sure there's enough water, indigenous animals,

243
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,260
and vegetation on this island to keep them alive.

244
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,260
But they've got to have the ingenuity and the skills

245
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,260
to find it, hunt it, and kill it.

246
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look, look, look, look, look.

247
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Rays, fuck, they're shallow, aren't they?

248
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
We need a weapon.

249
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
We need a spear.

250
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Okay, try that, try that.

251
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Come on, boys, let's get one of these.

252
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
They're going deeper.

253
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Something weighs one, survivors nail.

254
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Anything that's heart is beating in its chest, I will eat it.

255
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Yeah.

256
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,260
My biggest observation about living in a jungle

257
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,260
is how quickly you lose your sentimentality.

258
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
When I look at something, I'm not thinking,

259
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
''That's beautiful,'' or, ''Look at the little creature.''

260
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,260
I'm thinking, ''Can I eat that?''

261
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Hurry up, there's an iguana.

262
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Just straight through.

263
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
There's an iguana.

264
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Just straight through.

265
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

266
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
And you keep at him.

267
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,260
And you go out and round, push him back to you.

268
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
What's that?

269
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Stamp on him, he flip-flops.

270
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
It's there, I could see it.

271
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
There's some stingrays, guys.

272
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

273
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Okay, he's in. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

274
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Get him! Oh, and you get him.

275
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Oh! Get him behind it.

276
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Oh!

277
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
Cut him off.

278
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
Get him, get him.

279
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Get him, get him.

280
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Get him, get him, get him.

281
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
There he is, there he is.

282
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
That's dinner.

283
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Son of a bitch!

284
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
He's gone.

285
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
A death man could hear us coming.

286
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
We are top predator.

287
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
We've got to stay that way.

288
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
If we're going to survive, if not,

289
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
we'll all be going home shortly.

290
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,260
The men's first day's hunting has produced nothing.

291
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
We are winging it.

292
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
And if it weren't for being such a stubborn person

293
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
and so positive,

294
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I think I'd have been on my way a long time ago.

295
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Starving and dehydrating slowly is not a nice way to go.

296
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
The monsoon is coming.

297
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Here it comes.

298
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Here it comes.

299
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Land on the hatches.

300
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
In the middle of the night,

301
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,260
the men are woken by the most vicious tropical storm yet.

302
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

303
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Whee!

304
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
I'm fucking pissing, Darren.

305
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
It's amazing.

306
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
From nowhere, you get that really big wind.

307
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Yeah.

308
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Whoa!

309
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,260
Where's the pan to protect the fire?

310
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Fuck!

311
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Fucking hell.

312
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Shit.

313
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Wow, it's coming in.

314
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,260
After yesterday's exhausting and fruitless search for food,

315
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,260
the men must now spend precious energy saving their fire.

316
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
This is where we dig deep, boys.

317
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
This is where we dig deep.

318
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
But for some,

319
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
it's becoming hard.

320
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
It's becoming too much.

321
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
I'm just really, really tired.

322
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Like, unbelievably tired.

323
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
I've got a lack of dry wood.

324
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
That's just the problem, really.

325
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Lack of dry wood.

326
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,260
So tonight's going to be a bit difficult now.

327
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Barney, these things are eating testers, my man.

328
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
I know.

329
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
It's what we do in adversity what makes us men.

330
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Oh, ho, ho!

331
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
See that?

332
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Wow!

333
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Come on, mother nature, do your worst!

334
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,260
We're almost there!

335
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
About 8 o'clock in the morning.

336
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Hammer it down, which it has been since about 4 o'clock this morning.

337
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
And when I say hammer it down, I mean hammer it down.

338
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
It's relentless.

339
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,260
But anyway, my body's starting to take its own name.

340
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,260
I've got blisters all over my feet.

341
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
I'm shivering and shaking all the time.

342
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,260
It's just bloody horrible.

343
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,260
It's whooped my arse big time.

344
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,260
In fair play to these other guys.

345
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
I mean, they're like gladiators.

346
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Unbelievable.

347
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,260
And in comparison, I'm a pussy.

348
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
He's an older guy,

349
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
and he's starting to come up with the part at the seams.

350
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
No food, no sleep.

351
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Wet, cold, beaten up.

352
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
It takes its toll.

353
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
How's the wood looking down? Terrible.

354
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Everything's just absolutely soaking wet.

355
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,260
After a night-long struggle, the men manage to save their fire.

356
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
But now they're exhausted.

357
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
It's a perpetuating cycle, isn't it?

358
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
The more you lack in energy, the less you can do.

359
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Having barely eaten in the last week...

360
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,260
Barely.

361
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Barely's rambling.

362
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,260
..their situation is getting desperate.

363
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,260
We need to find a solid source of protein and carbohydrate

364
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
or we are going to seriously struggle.

365
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
It's getting to the point now,

366
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
if we don't eat properly in the next few days,

367
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
I can see other people leaving this island.

368
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,260
We're hunting, we will go. We're hunting, we will go.

369
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Come on, let's rock and roll.

370
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,260
The men head out once again on the search for food.

371
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
But today, 51-year-old builder Andy

372
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,260
is too tired to join them.

373
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
You all right, mate?

374
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
You OK?

375
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Not really, no.

376
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
You look exhausted.

377
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
I'm not sleeping at all.

378
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Maybe 20 minutes.

379
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
And even when I am lying there,

380
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,260
my brain's still whizzing away, you know?

381
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,260
It's starting to drive me fucking nuts.

382
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
And I just hope for you all.

383
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Oh, mate, what?

384
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,260
I'm worried about Andy.

385
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Yet again, he woke up this morning

386
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
to say that he's not a decent, nice kid.

387
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
What can you do, you know?

388
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Come on, fella. It's all right.

389
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
How about this?

390
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
It's me and you. Build a bed.

391
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Get some comfy bedding and a roof.

392
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Let's make that.

393
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
And you've got a decent bed.

394
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Right, come on, me and you. Let's go.

395
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Come on.

396
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
These are alligators on this island.

397
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Son of a bitch.

398
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Led by cleaning facilities manager Vic,

399
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,260
the hunting party are pushed deep into the island's interior.

400
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
What have you seen, Vic?

401
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Alas, nothing.

402
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,260
But finding food in the jungle is no easy task.

403
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Wow.

404
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
It's just full of...

405
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
..ants and eggs.

406
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
Snake!

407
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
Where?

408
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,260
And danger lurks around every corner.

409
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Somewhere here is a brown snake.

410
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Been like shit off a stick.

411
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
This is good bait.

412
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
Shit.

413
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
There's a scorpion here.

414
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Whoa.

415
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,260
I do not want to get stung.

416
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah, he's gone.

417
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
OK.

418
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Bastard. I can taste him from here.

419
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,260
There's a lot of things that can kill you on this island.

420
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,260
Snakes, spiders, crocodiles.

421
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,260
The longer I'm here without a proper meal,

422
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
the more I realise that if something's going to fuck us up,

423
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,260
it's probably going to be a lapse in concentration.

424
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
Ooh, you fucker!

425
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,260
There's bats everywhere.

426
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Straight out of that tree there.

427
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
That's where the bats live.

428
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Ooh!

429
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Can we eat bats?

430
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
I don't know.

431
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Is that what gives you HIV and Ebola and all sorts of...

432
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah, don't they carry your aids?

433
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
Forget it. We're not eating bats.

434
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
This island looks very peaceful.

435
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
You could even say heavenly.

436
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,260
But if you look just at a little bit more depth,

437
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,260
this place is an accident waiting to happen.

438
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
So why are you doing this then, fella?

439
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,260
I think because my life has been like one adventure, you know?

440
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Moving from Tenerife, Lanzarote, America, all that kind of stuff.

441
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,260
But then the last 17 years, I've been stagnant, doing nothing.

442
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,260
So I think this was a way of sort of saying,

443
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
right, off we go again.

444
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
And that it is, my friend.

445
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Yeah, it certainly is. Jesus.

446
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
If only I'd have known.

447
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Are you regretting it?

448
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,260
I am at this moment, mate, if I'm totally honest, yep.

449
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,260
And my biggest regret, if I do go, would be letting you lot down.

450
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm trying. I'm really trying.

451
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,260
It seems like Andy's already given up.

452
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm desperate not to lose another person, you know?

453
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
I can't go from 14 down to 11.

454
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm dropping like flies. We've not even started yet.

455
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Is that not a caiman track?

456
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Er, he might be a white one.

457
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
After a fruitless morning in the jungle,

458
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,260
some of the men have set their sights on a far more ambitious prize.

459
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
We're off caiman hunting.

460
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
It's this way down here.

461
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
See those trees?

462
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
That's where it comes out. Yeah.

463
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,260
28-year-old website consultant Kyle

464
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,260
has spotted a crocodile at the end of the beach.

465
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Five of us are going that side, five of you this side.

466
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,260
Keep your eyes behind you.

467
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Which the men are hoping to ambush.

468
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
He's going to see you when he comes out.

469
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,260
Along the coast, 29-year-old paramedic Barney

470
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,260
and cameraman Ross are off to try their luck

471
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
with improvised fishing rods.

472
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm going to be incredibly positive.

473
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,260
We're going to get at least a couple of fish. Yeah.

474
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,260
At least a minimum of a couple of fish. Yes.

475
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
I've delivered three babies

476
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,260
in the course of my seven years in the ambulance service,

477
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
and that's a pretty special feeling.

478
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,260
But it's not as glamorous as everyone makes out.

479
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,260
You soon realise it's largely dealing with drunk people in gutters,

480
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,260
vomit-ridden kind of students.

481
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,260
I love the famous five, Swallows and Amazons.

482
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
It's something about probably going on your own adventure.

483
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
It takes you back to your childhood, doesn't it?

484
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Building trees, building dens.

485
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
It would be nice to think I've come off the island

486
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
feeling a little bit more macho,

487
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
a little bit more popular with the ladies.

488
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
There's a lot of fish down there.

489
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Come on, positive thoughts are going through the rod.

490
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Oh, I've got a big one!

491
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
Whoo!

492
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Fuck!

493
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Pull me down.

494
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,260
The men have been attempting to stake out a caiman

495
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
for almost two hours,

496
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,260
but so far they haven't seen a thing.

497
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
What do you think?

498
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,260
I think some of our hunting team is always ready in action,

499
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
ready to go.

500
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
I like your coil of spring.

501
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
It would be fantastic if we could get a caiman,

502
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,260
but you also need to get water, fire and food.

503
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
I am starving.

504
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Come on, then, mate.

505
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Plus, everyone's just getting eaten to shit by these sand flies.

506
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Well, let's return to camp.

507
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Start to finish, absolute joke.

508
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Everybody just went up there, asked about it.

509
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,260
We had no plan when we got there, no nothing.

510
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
We were like Keystone Cops.

511
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
So that's going to be great.

512
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Right, I'm going to gamble this.

513
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Oh!

514
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Eh?

515
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
There you go.

516
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I've been bouncing it.

517
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Yeah.

518
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Mate, didn't get any fucking better.

519
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Yeah.

520
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Ain't got to worry about creepy crawlies.

521
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
OK, how about this?

522
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
If you have a decent night's sleep,

523
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
give a decent night's kit tonight and stay.

524
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
I will do that.

525
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
I promise.

526
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
OK.

527
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Are we happy?

528
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
I'm happy, mate.

529
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
You're a wonderful man.

530
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Top man.

531
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
I'm going to hold you to it, you know?

532
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
I know you will.

533
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Hey, come on.

534
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Bring in the love.

535
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Sadly, all the cupboards are bare.

536
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,260
After an exhausting day, the hunting party have nothing to show for their efforts.

537
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,260
They didn't look healthy, some of these boys.

538
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Some of them look like maybe gone on hunger strike.

539
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Well, I'm absolutely burnt out.

540
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Today's a day where I definitely feel like I am starving.

541
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,260
So the average British man needs about 2,500 calories a day.

542
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:18,260
But the reality of a survival situation here, you're working hard, you're hunting and building shelters, chopping wood.

543
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
You can easily burn.

544
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,260
You can easily burn in excess of 4,000 calories.

545
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
The mass of that is simple.

546
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,260
If you're burning more than you're taking in, you're going to starve.

547
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Can you just let the lads know that we've gone fishing?

548
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
All right.

549
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I've got some energy still left in me.

550
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,260
With nightfall approaching, the men are desperate to salvage something from the day.

551
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,260
What the fuck was that?

552
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,260
Something just fucking...

553
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Something stung you?

554
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah.

555
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Fuck me, do I know about it?

556
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
You can't see what it was?

557
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
No.

558
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Definitely wasn't a scorpion, was it?

559
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
I have no idea.

560
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Mic to India, mic to India.

561
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Cameraman Sam uses the emergency sat phone to call the offshore medical response team.

562
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Charlie has been stung on the toe from something in a wood pile.

563
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Fuck me.

564
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
Oh, shit, it's a scorpion, yeah.

565
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
It's a scorpion, guys.

566
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Where is it? Let me feel it.

567
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
Here.

568
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Scorpion.

569
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Confirmation, it is a scorpion, over.

570
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,260
It's a general rule of thumb.

571
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,260
The bigger the pincer, the smaller the stinger, the less deadly the scorpion.

572
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Bark scorpion, enough venom in that stinger to kill a man.

573
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Not good, man.

574
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
Not good.

575
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,260
I don't know much about scorpions, but I think there is a kind that's very, very poisonous.

576
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
We were told before we got here that that could kill you.

577
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Fuck.

578
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Fuck, man.

579
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
That's not what we need.

580
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,260
The medics have asked Sam to urgently identify the type of scorpion that stung Charlie.

581
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
That stung Charlie.

582
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Ah, dude.

583
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Is it painful?

584
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Okay, so that length, that is what, two inches long?

586
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,260
So he's got big claws, which is a good thing.

587
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
The bigger the pincers, the less the venom, apparently.

588
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
So fingers crossed.

589
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,260
He doesn't look like a bark scorpion, does he?

590
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:10,260
To treat it symptomatically in peace, the response can't be updated on the condition of the patient, over.

591
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Copy that, will do.

592
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Fucking, this mate is so sensitive.

593
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
So?

594
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:22,260
So, good news, from the description of this little bad boy here, from that pincer, that

595
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
probably means he's not super toxic.

596
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,260
We're going to keep an eye on you, make sure that that doesn't swell massively and you

597
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
don't get any other allergic reactions.

598
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,260
It's like someone's driving roasting hot needles in and out.

599
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Yeah.

600
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
I think you're milking a bit now, mate.

601
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Oh, no, I need to suck it up, don't I?

602
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Oh, come on, you're supposed to be English.

603
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Thankfully, it wasn't particularly poisonous, but it must have hurt.

604
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Like, nobody's business.

605
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Poor guy.

606
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
Charlie, Charlie.

607
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
I do not need dipping over.

608
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
Thank you.

609
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,260
Charlie, seriously, keep your weight off it.

610
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Oh, actually, maybe.

611
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,260
Keep your weight off it.

612
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Easy.

613
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Don't cry.

614
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,260
It's not nice to see anyone like that, really.

615
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,260
The boy is what I would like to call OTG.

616
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,260
He is out the game.

617
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:10,260
The medics have advised Charlie to stay off his feet for the rest of the day.

618
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Let's go and be the saviours of today.

619
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Go on, then.

620
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
OK.

621
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Rods.

622
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,260
With now only an hour to sunset, paramedic Barney and cameraman Ross set out to make a

623
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,260
last-ditch attempt to catch dinner for the group.

624
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Yeah, let's go.

625
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,260
But to get back to the headland where they've seen most fish, they face a treacherous scramble

626
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
across the rocks.

627
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,260
It's quite hot, isn't it?

628
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
And the tide's coming in fast.

629
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,260
So I feel there is a bit of a risk, actually.

630
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I don't like to take risks.

631
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,260
We're not going to gain anything by walking back now, are we?

632
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,260
No.

633
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Let's do it.

634
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

635
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,260
Sorry.

636
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Hang on.

637
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,260
I have to wait for the tide to go out, and then we're making that gap there.

638
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,260
So the Pacific really is just a vast ocean.

639
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,260
It's actually the largest in the world, covering over 60 million square miles.

640
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
You've got these fierce ocean currents.

641
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
They swirl around these little islands.

642
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,260
And if you get swept out into them, you really genuinely don't stand a chance.

643
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,260
The next stop that way is the Galapagos Islands,

644
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
but the sharks don't get you first.

645
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

646
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea to make or not.

647
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Whoa!

648
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Taking quite a risk just to get a fish.

649
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
It's been a while since I've been hungry.

650
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
And you've got to take risks, haven't you, really?

651
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
What do you think?

652
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Is this a bit dodgy, or?

653
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Good.

654
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:01,260
As long as we're on the same wavelength, the sea's a lot rougher, though.

655
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,260
If we get swept off it, we're mincemeat.

656
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Just one of those gates here.

657
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
You OK, Ross?

658
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Barney and Ross finally reach the point where they want to fish,

659
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
but it's now going dark.

660
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Do you ever think you could do that, Barney?

661
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
God, no.

662
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Not in a million years, do you?

663
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
No, wasn't it?

664
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Ah, it's so exciting.

665
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,260
It's that proper survival, isn't it?

666
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
It's not armchair survival.

667
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Oh, mine's a tough one.

668
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Ah!

669
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Ah, shit!

670
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Ross?

671
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Quick, mate, quick as you like.

672
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
Fucking lost the camera.

673
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
Are you OK?

674
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,260
Just get up out of here, mate.

675
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Fuck!

676
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Oh!

677
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
God, no!

678
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Just watch out.

679
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
What am I touched on?

680
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
The camera's every time.

681
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Eh?

682
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
The camera's ever fucking smashed into Ross.

683
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,260
I think it's fair to say we nearly got killed, actually.

684
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,620
We walked up there to do some fishing.

685
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,740
We put the phone down.

686
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,500
He was behind me. I turned round to see a huge wave,

687
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,220
probably about ten feet, engulf Ross,

688
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,180
and then Ross was gone, like that.

689
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,900
And then I ran down and managed to grab him.

690
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
I pulled him out.

691
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,820
I've never been so terrified in my life.

692
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,220
You've got to be serious, mate.

693
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,460
Afternoon, guys. Where you been?

694
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
Hello, boys.

695
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,700
I'm shaken, to say the least.

696
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Do you want to take more of us, I think?

697
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,980
Make some room for the guys.

698
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,860
There's a massive wave right over me,

699
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,260
swept me straight out on the rocks.

700
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,580
While we were fishing, straight out, like that?

701
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,060
Grabbed the rocks back up,

702
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,820
and then another massive one took us both down.

703
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,860
Can we please say no more fishing at night, then, please?

704
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,860
Yes.

705
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,220
You are a true team man, aren't you?

706
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,300
It's really made me realise just how careful we need to be

707
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,300
and how careful I need to be and about how vulnerable I am.

708
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,500
Despite feeling as though

709
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,900
as a young guy that actually you are invincible,

710
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,500
out here, it's just not the case at all.

711
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,620
You all right?

712
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
You look fresh, near a death experience.

713
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
Yeah.

714
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,820
Mark, you look shaken, man.

715
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,860
I am shaken.

716
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,060
Have a drink.

717
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,580
We did get some fish, though, right?

718
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,060
Seriously?

719
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,900
That's what you take from that?

720
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,260
Tell you what, this is one hell of an adventure, isn't it?

721
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,580
It's turned out to be a real men and mice game, this.

722
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,420
Good night, everybody. I'm sorry I'm not being rude.

723
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,580
Get some rest, mate.

724
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,500
51-year-old Andy hasn't slept well since arriving on the island.

725
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,820
I'm absolutely exhausted.

726
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,980
Concerned he'll leave if he doesn't get some quality rest,

727
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,020
the group are hoping his new bed is the answer.

728
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,580
Andy's got the skill set that we absolutely desperately need on the island.

729
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,020
He's a builder by trade, so he could shortcut so many of our processes.

730
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,500
So, you know, I want him to stay.

731
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,340
He didn't... I'm sure he didn't come on the island to fail.

732
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,700
So, if you have a decent night's kip, then you're not going to leave us?

733
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,860
That was the deal, wasn't it?

734
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,220
If I have a decent night's kip.

735
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
All right, then.

736
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,220
5am. All of the men are sound asleep.

737
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,780
Except for one.

738
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm feeling dreadful.

739
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,740
I've got an ear infection. I'm shaking.

740
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,420
I know I'm shut down. You know what I mean?

741
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,300
So, I'm not happy.

742
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,580
I'm not happy about it, right?

743
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,300
Andy woke up this morning, first thing he said to me, he said,

744
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,100
''Oh, I'm off.''

745
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,060
He's crying out loud.

746
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,620
Paul and Joe have just gone.

747
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,940
That Paul's just gone because of you, Andy.

748
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,140
If you thought you were going to go, why didn't you...?

749
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,300
I just found out that we're losing Andy and our final builder.

750
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,820
It's almost panic stations.

751
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,460
Are you suggesting we're not leaving?

752
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,860
Are you fucking bollocks?

753
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Right, I'm walking away.

754
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,580
I'll hug you to a tree before you fucking go.

755
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,940
Andy's threatening to leave us all very well,

756
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,420
but I'll be patient.

757
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,420
Part of me just wishes, if he's going to go, he should just fuck off, really.

758
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,980
I'd like to say I want the boat here now, over and out. Bye.

759
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,780
Just a day after deciding he would stay,

760
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,300
Andy uses the emergency satellite phone

761
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,020
to request an evacuation.

762
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,900
Andy Pandy is leaving today.

763
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,700
Something that I kind of predicted, really.

764
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,060
I think Paul was just an excuse.

765
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,940
So, really, it was a shame that Paul had to go

766
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,620
because Andy was always going to go in the end.

767
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,940
Take care.

768
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,420
I can't give myself or you guys any more. I'm sorry.

769
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,180
What can you do, you know?

770
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,940
We're down to 11 people after not even a week.

771
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,260
It's just embarrassing.

772
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,780
When people leave a survival group,

773
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,860
the remaining members can often feel this sense of desertion,

774
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,180
betrayal, maybe even a little bit of jealousy.

775
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,980
I mean, who wouldn't want to leave what, for many of them,

776
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,140
really is a living hell?

777
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,740
But ultimately, losing a negative influence

778
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,980
will be a good thing for the long term of the group.

779
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,980
I've been pretty tired today.

780
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,860
Really could do with some food.

781
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,460
Eight days in, with barely a thing to eat,

782
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,980
and delayed by Andy's departure...

783
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
Fucking little fish.

784
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,500
..the men resume their daily search for food.

785
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,540
I don't know why people choose to do this in their free time.

786
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,700
Fish? Yeah.

787
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
I don't do a lot of it.

788
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,340
Father-in-law lives it, absolutely fucking lives it.

789
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,340
He's a dick.

790
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,900
Every day is a white day...

791
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,060
..while the others hunt.

792
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,340
29-year-old Barney has volunteered for fire duty.

793
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,020
I'm happy, actually, because I'll do it back at base.

794
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,820
The grouper, worried that his near-death experience yesterday

795
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,820
has knocked his confidence.

796
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,140
He literally got swept off the rocks.

797
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,780
He's got bumps and scrapes,

798
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,780
and if it wasn't for Barney saving Ross's life,

799
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,540
things would have been really serious.

800
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,060
I think it's just a reminder of what this place is like.

801
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,180
It just feels like everything around us is genuinely trying to kill us.

802
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,300
He's such a nice guy, so easy to relate to,

803
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,020
but I just felt a little bit sorry for him today,

804
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,620
so I'm going to keep my eye on Barney.

805
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,100
I think he was crying now, just before you got the camera.

806
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,580
He is finding it really tough.

807
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,980
He is seriously lethargic, looks seriously homesick,

808
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,940
and he's a grouch.

809
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,620
He needs to get himself back on his feet.

810
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,620
Having already lost three men,

811
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,940
cameraman Ross is worried the group could soon be in danger of losing another

812
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,620
and persuades Barney to join him on a fishing trip

813
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,620
in an attempt to lift his spirits.

814
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,900
I thought you looked really low and that you weren't enjoying yourself

815
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,020
and just looked like you wanted to get out of here.

816
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,380
I was a bit worried that you might go,

817
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,380
fuck it, and leave, you know?

818
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,500
I think everyone's having their low days too, right?

819
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,940
After any sort of frightening near-death experience,

820
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,780
it's very normal to become withdrawn and a little bit introverted,

821
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,780
and people tend to then do everything they can

822
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,660
to avoid having to face that same fear.

823
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,500
But trying to survive on a desert island, the men don't have that luxury.

824
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,500
They need to conquer their fear, otherwise it will conquer them.

825
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm finding it difficult now, actually.

826
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,180
I feel like I've had enough of being here.

827
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,060
And every time I think about my family, I find it more difficult.

828
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,820
And I realise that this week is the week that I'm meant to be at Centre Parcs.

829
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
But I just wanted to kind of apologise.

830
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,420
There's a little blue fish down here.

831
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,700
So have you got a spear?

832
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Yeah.

833
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,900
That makes a fish.

834
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,140
He's a fucking good fish, I know that.

835
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Bastard.

836
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,180
In their first week on the island, the men have barely eaten.

837
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
That spear's not worth donkey poo.

838
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Fucking rubbish.

839
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,820
All of their attempts to find a decent meal have ended in failure.

840
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,900
No luck today, but that's why it's called fishing and not catching.

841
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:23,260
Today's lunch for 11 famished men is slim pickings from the jungle floor.

842
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,180
Guys, this is exciting.

843
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Scorby?

844
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,020
It's got a few ants on it at the moment,

845
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,700
because we killed it about half an hour ago.

846
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,660
But who's up for a leet?

847
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,060
Yes, please.

848
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Fuck it, I'll eat it.

849
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,380
Heaven in your mouth.

850
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Burn the ants off.

851
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,220
Da-da-da!

852
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Where's the game?

853
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,980
Why haven't you given it to him, then?

854
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,100
Why can't I have any?

855
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,260
Oh, because you're too northern.

856
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,860
I'm too northern?

857
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm feeling victimised because I'm the northern one.

858
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,300
That's it, you can all kiss my arse.

859
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,940
You're a brave man, Dan.

860
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,140
What's it like?

861
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
It's pretty gross.

862
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Is it?

863
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
It's like eating crispy poo.

864
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
Is it?

865
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Yeah.

866
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,060
I'm glad it was you, then.

867
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,940
In a survival situation, every mouthful counts.

868
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,500
Tell you what, it's better than limp it.

869
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,980
Is it?

870
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,540
But one scorpion between 11 grown men

871
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,340
is nowhere near enough to save them from starvation.

872
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,860
It's hard to concentrate.

873
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,300
I'm noticing that energy is so low.

874
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,140
I'm so bloody hungry.

875
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,140
I'm going to burn out.

876
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,220
Man, this place wears you down.

877
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
It really does.

878
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,660
I just tried standing up,

879
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,740
and then started sort of got the standard head brushes,

880
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,220
and then really just, I was just sort of rocking backwards and forwards.

881
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,180
I don't know, only for a few seconds, but enough to put me on my arse.

882
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,700
It's getting to the point now, if we don't eat properly in the next few days,

883
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,060
we're going to drop like flies.

884
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
Despite their rapid physical decline,

885
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,220
their men have no choice but to keep on hunting.

886
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,860
It's quite a daunting thing, really, isn't it?

887
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,380
The idea that we might come across Heyman today.

888
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,980
37-year-old Sam has persuaded Barney to join him

889
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,260
in a bid to keep him busy after his accident.

890
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,740
I can't convey how tough this whole thing has been, actually.

891
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,660
Far, far tougher than I thought.

892
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,940
I'm really, really struggling to...

893
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,540
..to stay focused and to keep up with the rest of the team.

894
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,940
There's a berry on this tree. Here, look.

895
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,180
Doesn't look edible, does it?

896
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,300
Shit the dog! Shit the dog!

897
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,900
Look at that. A big, big lizard under here.

898
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,500
It's an iguana. I can see it's a big one.

899
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Yes, keep going.

900
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes, there you go. Good.

901
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,820
OK, you see him there? I'm going to flick him out.

902
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,460
OK, here he comes. Here he comes. Here he comes.

903
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,420
Here he comes. Here he comes. OK, watch that tail.

904
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,940
OK, you've got him. You've got him. You've got his tail.

905
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,460
Pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him.

906
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,140
Pull him, pull him, pull him.

907
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
You absolute... Stop!

908
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,620
Stop!

909
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,740
Oh, my gosh. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

910
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,620
Let's talk about this, because, actually,

911
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,940
we could use our meat alive, could we not?

912
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,500
Oh, my gosh. Well done, mate. Well done.

913
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,180
Oh-hoo-hoo!

914
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,500
Oi!

915
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,500
Whoo!

916
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,500
Get in!

917
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah!

918
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,660
Yeah!

919
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,780
Hooray!

920
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
Whoo-ya!

921
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,340
Hooray-ho-ho-ho!

922
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,740
It's an iguana!

923
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
Oh!

924
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Get in, Barney.

925
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Get in.

926
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,140
Look at the size of that one.

927
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,660
Wow, Barney, that's half a leg.

928
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,140
Now he's a cock-a-banny, lad.

929
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,420
That's dinner and supper.

930
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,660
Well done, fella.

931
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,580
Nice little Barney.

932
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,740
He's a beautiful creature, actually, absolutely beautiful.

933
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,340
Look, he's like a little dinosaur.

934
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,460
Guys, this is my little contribution to today.

935
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,460
Wow.

936
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,780
It's an amazing feeling.

937
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,500
You really feel you've done your bit

938
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
for the team.

939
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,700
It's like when you give a really good Christmas present,

940
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,340
you just really want to give it.

941
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,300
I was thinking, guys, about killing that iguana.

942
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,380
Yeah.

943
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,540
I think that's probably a bit of a personal thing I need to get over.

944
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,380
I'm not killing something. Hang on a minute.

945
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,900
Why is that such a bad thing, that you do want to kill something?

946
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,180
Because the reality of it is that we all eat meat that's killed at some point,

947
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,460
and we're so far detached, aren't we, as we all know,

948
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,660
from the slaughtering process, that actually, for me,

949
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,940
maybe that's a challenge that I need to face.

950
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,940
If you kill it, will you have repercussions, sleepless nights,

951
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
in everyone?

952
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,220
Nobody!

953
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,900
I don't give a...

954
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,660
Blood, gush, stinking.

955
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,180
Let's put this in perspective. That bothers you?

956
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,620
I've been a paramedic for four years and seen some fantastic things, but...

957
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,460
I think I'd like to test myself.

958
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,460
Do it. Do it if you want to do it.

959
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,580
Don't do an Ozzy Osbourne and bite its head off, though.

960
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,060
Barney, how are you feeling?

961
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,900
It suddenly feels much more real

962
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,060
when you're having to sit here like the executioner, you know?

963
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,900
I condemn you and Juana to death.

964
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,500
It goes right over, doesn't it?

965
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Like this.

966
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,460
Let's do it. I'll go and get him.

967
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,620
Bring him down here, yeah?

968
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Woof.

969
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,860
All right, you got him. You got him.

970
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,060
Got him, got him, got him.

971
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,780
Yeah.

972
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,420
All right, Barney.

973
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,020
Yeah, so if you're able to hold his head down, actually...

974
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,060
Spot on.

975
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,660
...the food you're about to provide.

976
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,260
Great effort, Barney.

977
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Well done, Barney.

978
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,820
You all right, mate?

979
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Yeah.

980
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,460
Fucking hell.

981
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,140
A couple of my really close friends have got iguanas,

982
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,380
and I really don't know how they'll view this.

983
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,260
I don't think you...

984
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,180
I understand that this is completely a survival situation,

985
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,220
and I have...

986
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,140
Their pets are not in danger.

987
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,140
They can leave me in the lounge without them.

988
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,940
It's a very mix of emotions,

989
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,140
because you really have provided,

990
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,020
and everyone's got some food tonight, including myself.

991
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,500
Hopefully, it gives you a more...

992
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,980
a greater respect for the animal

993
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,220
than if I would just sit round tonight

994
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,220
having somebody else killed it.

995
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,340
I'm going to enjoy that meal more than anyone tonight.

996
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,740
I've seen it myself so often, you know,

997
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,860
it's a very quiet, humble individual

998
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,460
who the group maybe initially discount,

999
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,940
but suddenly they can become the man of the hour,

1000
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,980
just in one heroic moment.

1001
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,740
And these brave people earn respect through their deeds.

1002
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,220
They don't earn it through, you know, bluster.

1003
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,860
And really, that's what British courage is.

1004
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,340
After a week on the island,

1005
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,100
the men can finally sit down to a decent meal.

1006
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,220
It's like proper food.

1007
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,260
Isn't that just an incredible sight?

1008
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,420
Yeah, anything caramelised on the outside would be beautiful.

1009
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,900
This is going to be like...

1010
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,140
Is he eating his own neck?

1011
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,140
Yeah.

1012
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,460
That's just sick, Barney.

1013
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,020
They do say that Mother Nature watches what you do,

1014
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,260
and if you work hard enough, she rewards you.

1015
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,580
Today, she did.

1016
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,620
Good job, Barney.

1017
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,220
Here you go, guys. Well done, and congratulations.

1018
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,580
Well done, teams. Off to the Leavenses.

1019
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,940
To the Leavenses.

1020
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,020
Yes.

1021
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,540
Let's have a little taste, pass them on.

1022
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,620
Oh, it's delicious.

1023
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
It's really lovely.

1024
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,780
So good.

1025
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,260
The first time I've eaten something

1026
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,460
which is ridiculously, amazingly brilliant.

1027
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,940
Oh, that looks like a good piece, Barney.

1028
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Yes, it is, mate.

1029
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,060
Oh, yeah, Barney.

1030
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,780
There's more meat on this than I thought.

1031
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,140
Toilets, toilets.

1032
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,220
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,020
The Leavenses sitting around that cave, man,

1034
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,060
just gnawing and slurping and chewing

1035
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,540
and staring into the flames.

1036
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,860
Great.

1037
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,700
Grr.

1038
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,540
He's now literally cut his face in two.

1039
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,980
There you go.

1040
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
Yes.

1041
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,860
Feeling increasingly manly as the day goes on.

1042
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,740
See what it brings the group.

1043
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,420
It all feels worthwhile.

1044
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,940
No complaints with this at all.

1045
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,020
Yeah, great.

1046
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,820
I think the head might be my favourite bit.

1047
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,740
With food in their stomachs,

1048
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,820
the men's thoughts turn to Andy's unoccupied bed,

1049
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,740
which is now up for grabs.

1050
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,540
No wanking the individual bed, please.

1051
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,940
OK, I've completely misunderstood what it's for.

1052
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,900
LAUGHTER

1053
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,900
We'll put it...

1054
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,980
Has anyone knocked one out yet?

1055
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,500
Dude, after the third night...

1056
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,740
You're doing away?

1057
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
Every morning.

1058
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,740
I woke up prouder than a honeymooner, though.

1059
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,820
Seriously, you could want, like, a single-man A-frame.

1060
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,020
Come see me in the morning.

1061
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,580
LAUGHTER

1062
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,100
Buzzing tonight. Buzzing.

1063
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,820
It felt like a bunch of 11 mates sat around a campfire,

1064
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,380
on a wee holiday, eating great food.

1065
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,180
Fantastic 14 is now the excellent 11.

1066
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,980
LAUGHTER

1067
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,020
I'm under no illusions.

1068
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,580
Things will come.

1069
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,460
But if it means something, I remember it's a good,

1070
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,900
and they're good.

1071
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,980
It's right now.

1072
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,140
Buzzing

1073
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,940
Help! Back in!

1074
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,580
Next time on the Women's Island...

1075
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,620
I'm coming!

1076
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,900
Radio in now. Medic now.

1077
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,260
Oh, my God.

1078
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,420
What's just happened?

1079
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Just collapsed.

1080
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,900
Oh, don't you see that?

1081
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
LAUGHTER

1082
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,500
The group are still separated.

1083
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,900
Everyone needs off here. It's not a programme. It's ridiculous.

1084
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,860
Oh, my God!

1085
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,180
67.

1086
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,580
I can't navigate!

1087
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,980
I can't walk and I'm just fucked, I'm an old fox.

1088
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,660
Buzzing.

1089
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,700
Buzzing.

1090
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,340
Buzzing.

1091
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,420
Buzzing.

1092
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,440
Buzzing.

1093
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,780
Buzzing.

1094
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,220
Buzzing.

1095
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,140
Buzzing.

1096
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,660
Buzzing.

1097
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,780
Buzzing.

1098
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,780
Buzzing.

1099
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,840
you
