1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one is inhabited by 14 British

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,620
men while a separate island is home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be utterly alone with

3
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:33,500
only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything themselves

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:43,860
when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the

5
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:54,900
Windsor day who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island

6
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:09,180
survival will be harder than ever the search for water and hunt for food is now a matter of life or

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:21,840
death living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season when pitted against the

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
extremes of nature and the

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,960
these Monday women got what it takes to survive your bodies are just starting to fail I'm right on

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,280
the brink of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons over

11
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,220
foreign

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,240
get the knife get the knife first 10 women remain of the 14 I dropped off

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,940
on the remote Pacific Island you are not leaving this island I don't care if I have to carry you on

14
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,860
my back as they approach the four-week mark they're entering a new and potentially dangerous

15
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,200
phase of the experiment I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny without

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,080
enough food and water their bodies could be in serious danger of shutting down I think it's

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,660
about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal yesterday the women finally managed to

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,220
trap their first big prey

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:34,560
and ate their biggest meal yet anybody watches this in judges any of the girls here for what they've done today they can fuck all

20
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,740
it's day 26

21
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,620
oh

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,360
what's that it's moving

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,600
i knew there was things here that tried to burrow into your skin

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,240
don't worry about hurting me just get it out

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
The plague of parasites from yesterday's pig carcass has hit camp.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Basically, camp is in festivities.

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, Christ.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's wash down and we'll basically give each other a visual check.

29
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Who says we don't have to take our clothes off to have a good time?

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Hello!

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
She looks a bit angry.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
She was angry a bit, didn't she?

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Turns out I've had a tick right on my bum.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
It's made a right mess.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I've got one there a bit. It's got its head in there.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,600
These blood-sucking insects burrow their heads deep under the skin to feed,

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
exposing the women to a host of dangerous tropical diseases.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
And as I went like that with my fingernail,

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,600
the arse ends of this tick came up with its legs moving.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Well, I've... Oh, God, it knocked me sick.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Two, three.

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
OK.

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I think it's piggies' revenge.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Despite their recent pig kill,

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
the women now have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
with very little water for the past four weeks.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
From here, there's barely any research

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
about the effects of extreme survival on the body.

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And because of this, they're now entering dangerous medical territory.

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Without an adequate and constant supply of food and water,

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
they're going to risk long-term damage to their vital organs,

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and they don't want that.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Like that?

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah. It caught the pig.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
We cooked it as well, and now we're staying up all night

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
to preserve it in salt water from the sea

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
so that everybody can eat meat for the next three days.

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Hunters Lauren and Beth, along with Havilah and Becky,

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,600
are working through the night to ensure they make the most of yesterday's pig kill.

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Hey, that's island life.

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
While they're doing that, we are going to dig a hole in the ground

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
to bury the jerrycan.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,600
So it's going to be a bit like a fridge, but a fridge for, like, cavemen.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
With temperatures in excess of 30 degrees,

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
the coolest place to store the meat is underground.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Let's get it as deep as we can.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
To do this, Lauren and Beth have requisitioned

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
one of the women's two jerrycans,

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
which, up to this point, has been used to filter, boil,

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
and store their drinking water.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Um, I'm kind of not happy about that.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Which is a cause of concern for lifelong vegetarian Jamie.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I know it's quite a big deal,

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,600
but it's also quite a big deal for me drinking water.

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
There's no way I'm drinking out of that.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
It's got to be done.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
People must be fed.

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm a bit devastated about still being awake at this time in the morning.

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
This is not the same as tottering in at 5am on a pair of heels,

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
really, really drunk.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Having worked through the night,

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,600
the pig preservers head back to camp with the jerrycan filled with pork.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I think people have their priorities wrong.

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm not saying that they shouldn't have done that to preserve the pig,

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
because I also didn't want the pig to go to waste.

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I mean, I know I'm a vegetarian, so it's easy for me to say,

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
but it's almost like that was prioritised over our water,

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
and that's what I'm pissed off about.

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
OK, we're just going to cover this valve,

90
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
because we don't want any little nasties.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
On the island, Jamie's helped establish

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
a successful water purification system,

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
using one jerrycan for filtering

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
and the other jerrycan for cleaning.

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
The jerrycan is a kettle for boiling.

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
It's fucked up the whole water system.

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I've been sitting there for days doing it.

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
One jerrycan, get it on the boil.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Filter in the other jerrycan, get that on the boil.

100
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
And even then, we're struggling with the water.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Now we've got one shitty jerrycan without a lid.

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
So now I'm suffering.

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Midday.

104
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
With tonight's dinner stored in their makeshift fridge,

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
the women who stayed up preserving the pig

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
are resting on the beach.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You smell so clean.

108
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
No, I don't.

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm sniffing you.

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
55-year-old Julie is hard at work,

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
determined to supplement the women's dinner.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
She's spotted a dead fish.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
What I'm going to do is...

114
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,600
..I'm going to tie this up and tie it to my ankle

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
and see if anything else comes to eat it

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
that I can scoop up in my kiddie net.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
What a lacking talent.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I make up for in enthusiasm.

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
My mum used to say that.

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Oh, Julie.

121
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
8.62 altogether.

122
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm single, divorced.

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I've bought the house.

124
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
This is my second house that I've bought.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
And I've done it all on my own.

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I think I'm hard-working.

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Once I start, I'll really give it, you know,

128
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
till I'm absolutely dropping.

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's like I'm behind myself with a big stick all the time.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't give myself a break.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Just be careful.

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I don't want a shark taking your leg off.

133
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
This is the strangest fishing I've ever seen.

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Julie is killing me.

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I absolutely love her.

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll keep throwing it out like a distressed fish.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I don't know anything about fishing.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I could be a couple of hours.

139
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I'll give you the show.

140
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll give you the show.

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Oh, Julie.

142
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Further down the beach...

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Give me a really good chunk towards you.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
..Jamie's made a discovery

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
that could make her water more palatable.

146
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
That is lime leaves, isn't it? Yeah.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I've been picking heaps and heaps of these lime leaves

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
and putting it in this boiled water.

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
It just takes away some of that rotten taste.

150
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Totally tropical taste.

151
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
LAUGHTER

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm fucking determined we're going to get something out of this ocean.

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
On the shoreline, Julie is still hard at it.

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
No, she didn't!

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Yeah! Go, Julie!

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Wow.

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
No, she just lost it!

159
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Fish fell back in the water.

160
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I just fucking despair, I do, honest to God.

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
2pm. Julie is still fishing.

162
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
No.

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I don't think any fish could have gone here.

165
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
LAUGHTER

166
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Whilst the rest of the women are more interested in sunbathing

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
and relaxing on the beach.

168
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh!

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
This is why we came here.

170
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
This bay is an absolute dream, isn't it?

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Woo!

172
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Exhausted!

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Beth and Lauren wake to discover none of the other women have done any work.

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We've dayed up, we cooked breakfast for everybody,

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
we cooked supper for everybody,

176
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
and then we needed kind of a little bit of a break today,

177
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
and because we've had a break, everybody else has had a fucking break,

178
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
and nothing's happened.

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Do you know what?

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Sometimes I find this island sends me round the fucking bend.

181
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Everyone was agreeing, you know,

182
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
you guys need to have a bit more of a chill day.

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Well, everyone seems to have taken that as everybody's going to have a relaxing day.

184
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
So we're back at 4 o'clock in the evening.

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
There's no wood for the fire.

186
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Just feel like everyone's taking the piss, really.

187
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
So infuriating.

188
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I mean, in a minute, Lauren and I are going to start cooking again.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
On the preserved meat, and I guarantee you,

190
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
people that have been doing fuck-all all day

191
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
are going to be sitting front row and going,

192
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
all yum-yum-yum, eating all the big bits.

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
And that is just winding my fucking bobbin up.

194
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
MUSIC PLAYS

195
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Oh, my God.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Mmm, that smells funky, doesn't it?

197
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Lauren and Beth have dug up the jerrycan of preserved meat.

198
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I mean, that jerrycan does smell of fucking vomit, though, doesn't it?

199
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I think it's borderline.

200
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
It goes off very quickly, doesn't it?

201
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
With no other food collected during the day,

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
the women risk eating the suspect pork.

203
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Come and grab a coconut bowl and fill up.

204
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
What do you think, girls?

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I think it's going to be good.

206
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
It's going to be good.

207
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
What do you think, girls?

208
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Mmm.

209
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
It doesn't taste right, does it?

210
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It makes you feel a bit ill.

211
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It is absolutely disgusting.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Like, it tastes gross.

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
It's disgusting.

214
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
But, you know, when it's the only thing you've got to eat...

215
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
The pork may have been foul,

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
but at least Jamie's flavoured lime water has hit the spot.

217
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Oh, my God, Jamie, it's so good.

218
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

219
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
That was really exciting.

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
It's the best thing ever. Oh!

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
That's almost better than cunnilingus.

222
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I don't like them being down there.

223
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
What?

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I get scared.

225
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I don't... Like, what the fuck are they doing?

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
And their little beady eyes.

227
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Don't like it. Don't like it at all.

228
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm like, get up, get up!

229
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, my God.

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Excuse the farting.

231
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
What's that fucking smell?

232
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I know, it's awful.

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Last night, the women ate the rancid preserved pork,

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
but it's backfired on them this morning.

235
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
God, that was awful.

236
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm going to have to go.

237
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Oh, no, you're not going to be safe, are you?

238
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I don't know. I don't feel very well.

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Sorry!

240
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm basically shitting myself,

241
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
and I've no idea when it's going to happen,

242
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
and I have 30 seconds to go.

243
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Basically, then what happens is that you have explosive water,

244
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
diarrhoea coming out of you.

245
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Twice now I haven't been able to make it,

246
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
and I've had to bring back, like, my soiled pants and wash them.

247
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Harvey, can you take this... I'll take the head.

248
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Can you take the white thing for me?

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
With the preserved pork no longer edible,

250
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
the women remove the pig's remains

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
and jerrycan a pewter.

252
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
This is the first time they've taken the jerrycan

253
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
and the pitted meat from the camp.

254
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
It's rancid.

255
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Is the head in here?

256
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Rotting head.

257
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Fucking tick!

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I think we just ditched all of this shit.

259
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Yeah, none of it's moving back.

260
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
We don't need that canister, we don't need any of this.

261
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I don't need this in my life right now!

262
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Unconvinced they could salvage a rancid jerrycan

263
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
and use it to purify the water again,

264
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
the women throw it away.

265
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Oh, sorry.

266
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm coming out.

267
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I've learned from experience that big disasters

268
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
are often made up of quite small mistakes,

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
but they have consequences,

270
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
and it sets off like a chain reaction,

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
and that chain can be very hard to break.

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Now, with only one jerrycan to produce all their water,

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
the women are unknowingly heading towards a dehydration crisis.

274
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
We've lost half our buckets and half our containers now.

275
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
But we'll find more buckets and containers.

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
We couldn't possibly have brought those back.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
I mean, they were just a rack.

278
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
In one stroke, the women have halved the amount of drinking water

279
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
they can produce and have permanently disrupted

280
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
their purification system.

281
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Vegetarian Jamie is unimpressed.

282
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm not happy.

283
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
That's how much water I've got left.

284
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
I had that in this morning, so that's all I've drank today.

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm pissed off at the fucking situation.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
And I think I've got PNT.

287
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Uh-oh.

288
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah.

289
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Four weeks in,

290
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
and the women are entering uncharted survival territory.

291
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
It's fucking hard.

292
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Like, it's not a joke. It's really hard.

293
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
And I miss everybody.

294
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I miss my family so much,

295
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
and I miss my boyfriend so much and my best friend so much,

296
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
and all I want to do is, you know, have something substantial to eat

297
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
or have some water that doesn't taste like the bottom of a swamp.

298
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
But I just keep telling myself I have to keep pushing on.

299
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
The women have unwittingly put themselves at risk of dehydration

300
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
after discarding a contaminated jerry can.

301
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,600
It means they can now only boil and purify half the amount of drinking water.

302
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
When that happened yesterday, I was like...

303
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah.

304
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
She lost it.

305
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Don't ask for much, do you?

306
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Coconut's a problem.

307
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Exactly.

308
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Jamie is furious with the other women and decides to take drastic action.

309
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm really annoyed, actually.

310
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm going on strike now.

311
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm going to do what I want, when I want.

312
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm not doing anything else apart from the water.

313
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Because I cannot live without water.

314
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Rolling!

315
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Jamie has withdrawn her labour from the group

316
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
and will now only do the one job that benefits her,

317
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
collecting and purifying the water.

318
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm going to be water bitch.

319
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Because nobody else gets a shit.

320
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I don't understand.

321
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Where do you think it fucking comes from?

322
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
A tap?

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
I work on my own now,

324
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
so it's quite fun not having anybody to tell me what to do.

325
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I don't really like anybody bossing me about.

326
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
On the island, ideally, I would really like a fun bunch of girls.

327
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Anyone that took themselves too seriously,

328
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I would find that a bit difficult.

329
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,600
It's just a never-ending circle of chores to be done.

330
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,600
In camp, the women are working through their long list of daily jobs.

331
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,600
We have basic chores that have to be done on a daily basis

332
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
or else we won't survive.

333
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Getting wood for the fire, getting water and finding food.

334
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,600
And if we don't succeed in those, everything goes to hell in a handguard.

335
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
After this, I'm going to filter the water.

336
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm going to filter the water and then I'm going to have a bath,

337
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,600
brush my teeth, wash my clothes, chill out.

338
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Surviving takes hard graft

339
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
and everyone working together as a community.

340
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You've got to do all you can to keep a group cohesive and together,

341
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
because when it's together, it's strong.

342
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
It's not strong when it's fragmented and broken.

343
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Definitely have more water than you.

344
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You bitch.

345
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You talk too much.

346
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Shut up.

347
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
You took the bag off.

348
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
You shouldn't have seen mine.

349
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
The water wonderers return.

350
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Jamie starts purifying the water.

351
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
It's a process that takes up to three hours

352
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,600
but will now only produce one can's worth of water to drink.

353
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I feel like I'm going to faint.

354
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Julie and Havilah have moved on to their next job of the day,

355
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
collecting firewood.

356
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Is that hard work, girls?

357
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
So hard work.

358
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I have to sit down.

359
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Down all the way.

360
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Drained?

361
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Drained.

362
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
My mum had an expression and it's very true.

363
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Only willing horses get work to death.

364
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
My mum used to say that.

365
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Dead now.

366
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
She was work to death.

367
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
She was.

368
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
You've got some colour, Jamie.

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Good.

370
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm going to bed in the Scottish again.

371
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
2pm.

372
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
While the other women remain hard at work,

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Jamie is relaxing on the beach and it hasn't gone unnoticed.

374
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I feel like I haven't stopped today.

375
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Like, it's one job after the other after the other.

376
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
It's how it is.

377
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Being here, you've just got to be so busy.

378
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You've got to work as a team as well.

379
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I know.

380
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I know.

381
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I struggle to understand how some people function

382
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
on just doing one thing a day.

383
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Hey, tits McGee!

384
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Who the fuck thought?

385
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Jamie again, sunbathing on the beach.

386
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
There is a large handful of us that work solidly the whole time.

387
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Not for ourselves, though.

388
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
For the whole team.

389
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
So the whole team can benefit from it.

390
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm no good.

391
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm no good.

392
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Not everyone can benefit from it.

393
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm naked here.

394
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Stop filming me.

395
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
And not everyone has that same level of responsibility

396
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
and it's a joke.

397
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Jamie is so annoying.

398
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
If she hadn't have gone and got water,

399
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
then she would have done absolutely nothing for the whole day.

400
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Especially cos there's so much to do right now.

401
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
It just made me really frustrated and angry.

402
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Kind of a little bit like, where's the fucking team spirit gone, man?

403
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Bike meeting!

404
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Something had to be said because I was getting fucked off.

405
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
We are a small group now.

406
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
There's only ten of us.

407
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
And so we need everybody to be hands on deck.

408
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
And that isn't happening.

409
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
It's becoming really obvious, like,

410
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
that certain people are doing lots of things

411
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,600
and sometimes I do feel like some people aren't doing as much.

412
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Everybody is naked.

413
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Everybody is naked.

414
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Everybody is naked.

415
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Everybody is naked.

416
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Everybody is naked.

417
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Everybody is naked.

418
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Everybody is naked.

419
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Everybody is depleted of energy in a way.

420
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Get over that and accept that everyone has to pull their weight.

421
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Does everyone feel like they are contributing the same?

422
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
That's what I would want.

423
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Well, I do.

424
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I do, yeah, actually.

425
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I don't like sitting here, and people are making out,

426
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
as if some people are being lazy in the camp

427
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
and not pulling their weight.

428
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
It's not just a one-job day, which is my thing.

429
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
No, of course not.

430
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
But, you know, the jobs continue.

431
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
There are certain jobs that I don't feel that I actually need to partake in.

432
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
What do you mean by that?

433
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I can help with things that will benefit me.

434
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
That means anything to do with water.

435
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
But things that won't benefit me?

436
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
No, I don't care.

437
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
It's just crazy, crazy talk.

438
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It's just the lack of acknowledgement that, in fact,

439
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
they weren't pulling their weight.

440
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
How can you be so selfish?

441
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
How can you not give a shit about anybody else?

442
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I mean, it's just complete bullshit.

443
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I don't like getting told what to do and when to do it.

444
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
So if I want to lie down and sunbathe for an hour,

445
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
everybody else can fuck off.

446
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Lauren's upset, Jamie's upset.

447
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Interesting they've heard them both say

448
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
that they've been bullied by the other one.

449
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I just think they should just hug it out.

450
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Hug it out over a nice glass of warm swamp water.

451
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
With all the infighting, they've not noticed

452
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
that the water supply is dwindling.

453
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
It's turning to a standstill.

454
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Realistically, the women need to drink

455
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
about three litres of water a day.

456
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
At the moment, with only one jerrycan,

457
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
they're averaging just one, and you can't sustain that.

458
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Maybe a little drop more, darling?

459
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Today, Jamie has managed to boil and filter

460
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
the one remaining jerrycan,

461
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
but water is already running low.

462
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Doesn't look very much to me.

463
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
No, it's not much at all.

464
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
With not enough water to go round,

465
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Julie and Georgina take the line

466
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,600
to the last cup before leaving camp to go fishing.

467
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
There's only so much water in a jerrycan,

468
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
and it just so happens that you are at the back of the queue

469
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
because you're doing other things

470
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
and you don't get to fill up your bottle,

471
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
then there's barely any water left for you.

472
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I've got a nice bit of tangled net here,

473
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
which I'm going to try and get some crabs with.

474
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Good, good.

475
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Did you get your water?

476
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Yeah, to me. Have you got yours?

477
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Yeah.

478
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Do you want to put it in there?

479
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
It's all right, I can manage it.

480
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
OK.

481
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Come on, fellas.

482
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Just even a little one.

483
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Big saustern, isn't it?

484
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah.

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Back in camp, Lauren and Becky are getting ready to hunt.

486
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
They're prepared, just in case.

487
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
We have no water to drink.

488
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
We're going to have to go, aren't we?

489
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Yes, boss.

490
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Lauren, Beth and Becky have to leave camp to hunt

491
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
with nothing to drink.

492
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Trying to look for food in around here

493
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
is like trying to look for a needle in a haystack.

494
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I definitely feel like Beyoncé in the Survivor video now.

495
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
It's not as glamorous.

496
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Bit humid in here, isn't it?

497
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Hot, no water either.

498
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Not the best idea.

499
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Without water, the heat is beating them,

500
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
and the hunting party have no choice

501
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
but to return to camp empty-handed.

502
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Oh, my God, that sun is hot.

503
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
It is hot.

504
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Come on, fishies.

505
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
On the rocks, Julie and Georgina have now been fishing

506
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
for four hours in 30-degree heat.

507
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Oh, here's a boxfish.

508
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Bugger off.

509
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Look at that.

510
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Don't you go any further forward on that wall.

511
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Shit.

512
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Oh, dear. My head just went, then.

513
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Just sit down.

514
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh, dear me.

515
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I nearly hit the deck then, Julie.

516
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Everything went white.

517
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Oh, fucking hell.

518
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Do you mind if we make our way back?

519
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I just feel a bit rough.

520
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I think the two of us have got sunstroke.

521
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
With their water intake now down to just one litre a day,

522
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
the women don't know it,

523
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
but they are chronically dehydrated.

524
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
If they don't start upping their fluid intake immediately,

525
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
their kidneys will struggle to cope,

526
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
toxins build up in your body,

527
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
and I reckon within days, their internal organs will shut down.

528
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
And I'm not being dramatic about this.

529
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
They're in a lot of trouble.

530
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
They're in a lot of trouble right now.

531
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Oh, my God.

532
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
We've been out in the sun too long.

533
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
How are you doing, Jules?

534
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
It's a good source of love.

535
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Every time we moved, like, to sit up, stand up or sit down,

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
you know, we'd go all, ooh.

537
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
You know what I mean?

538
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
I feel like we've been stupid to sit out in the sun in that heat

539
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
with no water in the middle of the day.

540
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
It's so frustrating.

541
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
It's so frustrating because we could see all the fish there

542
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
and we desperately wanted to...

543
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I'm coming with you next time, Brie.

544
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
..catch them back.

545
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm too tired to even speak.

546
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I hate being like this.

547
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's horrible.

548
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Not having the energy to do anything.

549
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Yesterday, Julie and Georgina went fishing without enough water

550
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
and collapsed from dehydration.

551
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I can't stand this lack of strength in myself

552
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
and lack of energy

553
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
and inability to keep going all day

554
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
because my body just won't let me.

555
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Since discarding a contaminated jerrycan

556
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
and halving their water production,

557
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
it's slowly dawning on the water.

558
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
They've told the women that they're facing chronic dehydration.

559
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
There's just not enough water for everyone at the moment.

560
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
We've all got pretty much empty bottles at the moment,

561
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
so I now need to wait for this to get boiled,

562
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
which is going to take a long time.

563
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, fuck!

564
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh!

565
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
What's up?

566
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Water's just tipped over.

567
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

568
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh, for fuck's sake!

569
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Now, we've got one shitty jerrycan and it falls predictably.

570
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I knew it was going to fucking fall,

571
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
but by the time she's picked it up,

572
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
all the water's fallen out.

573
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I'm not drinking it off.

574
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Nobody is.

575
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I am feeling weak right now.

576
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Are you?

577
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I can't get up the sand.

578
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
It's like an effort to walk.

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
And it's so tiring.

580
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I don't know about you, Georgie, but I keep going light-headed.

581
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Do you?

582
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Yeah, every time I bend over.

583
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
It's terrible.

584
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
That seems really strange,

585
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
but every time I sort of bend down to do something

586
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
and then get back up, I get really dizzy.

587
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I think everyone's feeling the same, aren't they?

588
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I am really, really concerned about each of us

589
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
because we're not drinking enough.

590
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I mean, some people are drinking less than a litre a day.

591
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I think it's just got worse and worse and worse.

592
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Each of us is feeling like we're going to faint

593
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
at several points during the day.

594
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Having spotted the tell-tale signs

595
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
of serious dehydration,

596
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Dr Belinda calls an emergency meeting.

597
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
The biggest killer out here,

598
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
our biggest, highest risk is dehydration.

599
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
We should be getting two litres to four litres a day.

600
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
If everyone has one small bottle when you wake up,

601
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
then at least you're a quarter of the way there already.

602
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Look, we are in scary territory

603
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,600
where we just don't know what's happening to our bodies

604
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,600
and there could be an effect on our vital organs as well.

605
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Your kidneys,

606
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
and also your central nervous system.

607
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
So if you experience any weird symptoms at all, do tell me.

608
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
On that note, I just need a sample of your urine.

609
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,600
It's going to give me a general idea of any alarming kidney problems.

610
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Hi, Belinda.

611
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Yay, thank you.

612
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Belinda will send the samples

613
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
to my support medical team on a nearby island.

614
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,600
So if any of us are in extreme danger, then what happens?

615
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
You'd be evacuated off.

616
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
If there's any indication of serious damage to your kidneys,

617
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,600
then we would need to look into that immediately.

618
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
And is it possible for some of us to be in this state

619
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
without knowing about it?

620
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Yeah, because a lot of the symptoms mimic problems that we actually have.

621
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Tiredness is a big thing with kidney failure.

622
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Nausea as well.

623
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
We could well be in this serious situation, be unaware of it.

624
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
And it was quite alarming what she had to say, really,

625
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
about the way that our bodies can start to fail.

626
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
I suppose I should have paid more attention

627
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
to what was going to happen to my body.

628
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I was surprised that I was potentially at such risk.

629
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,600
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

630
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Oh, my God!

631
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Whose is that short one? Georgina.

632
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
It's like Guinness.

633
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,600
To investigate their health further,

634
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Dr Belinda also weighs the women.

635
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
115.

636
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't know what you were before.

637
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I think I was 120.

638
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
We're quite fragile in a sense,

639
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,600
and the fact is that the things that are kind of deteriorating in my body

640
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
are my gums and my tits.

641
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
If that continues, then I will probably end up being skeletal

642
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
within about two or three weeks.

643
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
And just kind of give up and just be like,

644
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
do you know what, let the fucking vultures peck at me.

645
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I was one too far.

646
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Oh, so you've lost a lot, haven't you?

647
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
You are 116.

648
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I can't have lost nine pounds.

649
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
You do look really, really thin.

650
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I expected to lose a few pounds each week.

651
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
You're not fucking nine pounds.

652
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Bit of a fucking hike, isn't it?

653
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
At that rate, I'm not...

654
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
You're going to be fucking carrying me off on a stretcher.

655
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
You know what I mean?

656
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm so fucking tired.

657
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
You're tired cos you never bloody stop.

658
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Well, that's...

659
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
You're like a bloody Duracell bunny, Julie.

660
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
I'm not.

661
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You are.

662
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Really not.

663
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You are.

664
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
The women may feel at rock bottom,

665
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
but an instinct to stay alive really is deep within us all.

666
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
You know, our subconscious wants us to survive and to thrive.

667
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Let's have a little scavenge

668
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
and see what we can find in this shit heap.

669
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
The group make a last-ditch attempt to produce more drinking water.

670
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Having discarded one of the jerrycans,

671
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Fi, Julie and the others forage for a second suitable container

672
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
to boil water.

673
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
What's that there?

674
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Basically just a load of shit.

675
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Nothing very useful, I don't think.

676
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Metal is something that really is important.

677
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I haven't seen any.

678
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
It's all plastic.

679
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
It's all plastic.

680
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
It's all plastic.

681
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I mean, it's all plastic, and you can't obviously boil it.

682
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I am certain it's plastic.

683
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
If we don't get the things we need, we won't survive.

684
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
It's as simple as that.

685
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Plastic bottles.

686
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Plastic cans.

687
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Basically, plastic.

688
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
And that's it.

689
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Oh, we don't want that!

690
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
They've failed to find any metal containers,

691
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
but Julie is not giving up.

692
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
We have to find something.

693
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Desperately dehydrated, she hunts further afield

694
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
to find a second container.

695
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
We'll be tired.

696
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
We'll be high again in a minute.

697
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Julie!

698
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Julie!

699
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
You all right?

700
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Julie!

701
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Jesus.

702
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Julie!

703
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Julie!

704
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Fucking hell, Jules.

705
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Come on.

706
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
It's day 35,

707
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,600
and 55-year-old Julie has collapsed from dehydration.

708
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
I'm just so weak.

709
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm so weak.

710
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Get Bea and get on the blower.

711
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
No.

712
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Jules, just no.

713
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Don't ring anyone.

714
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I'll get up now.

715
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
No, you won't. No, you won't. Just no.

716
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Bea, Julie's passed out.

717
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Stay there, Jules. Stay there.

718
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Go ahead. Fox Rock.

719
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
We've got a situation here in that Jules

720
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
has passed out.

721
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
With Dr Belinda away from camp collecting water

722
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
and out of reach,

723
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,600
my emergency medical team on a nearby island

724
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
is immediately scrambled.

725
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
How are you feeling?

726
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
I think it was just...

727
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
It's all right. Just precautionary, OK?

728
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
What do you want to do, Julie?

729
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
How do you feel about trying to sit up for me?

730
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
How does it feel?

731
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Just hold your pulse while you're sat up there.

732
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Yeah.

733
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Without drinking coffee.

734
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Without drinking at all.

735
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Without drinking today.

736
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I haven't had a lot today, to be honest.

737
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Nice.

738
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
You need to be constantly hydrated

739
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
to do the smallest tasks here.

740
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
And it really does go to show

741
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
that just in one little moment here,

742
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
it can all change.

743
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm happy you're bright enough. Everything's fine.

744
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Honestly, girl, please.

745
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
I'm so nervous.

746
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Right.

747
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
She's dehydrated.

748
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
You're all dehydrated.

749
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
If you can just keep an eye on her.

750
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
You put a whole load of fit soldier on iron like this

751
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
for weeks and weeks,

752
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
and they'd struggle with it as well.

753
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
No, definitely not a game.

754
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh, you're awful good to me.

755
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I don't think I'm a drama queen,

756
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
but I think...

757
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,600
..I could have just closed my eyes and drifted off.

758
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
I'm not cool like that.

759
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Even the strongest women are slowly dying of thirst.

760
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I might need to lie down again.

761
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
For nearly five weeks,

762
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
the group has been subsisting on barely any food,

763
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
and they remain down one jerry can,

764
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
producing half the water they need to survive.

765
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Basically, I think I...

766
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,600
..either almost fainted

767
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
or very briefly...

768
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,600
..very briefly lost consciousness.

769
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
The signs of chronic dehydration

770
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
really are now starting to show amongst women.

771
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
And to give you an idea,

772
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
just losing just 5% of your body weight in water

773
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
leads to irritability, headaches, lightheadedness.

774
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,600
When you get to 8%, the lack of water causes fainting fits.

775
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
After that, delirium.

776
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Delirium, an hallucination set in.

777
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,600
And when you get to 15% to 20% of your body weight lost,

778
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
you're dead.

779
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
It's literally just our minds now getting us through it.

780
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
It's literally just people being like,

781
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
I am going to finish this, I am going to finish this,

782
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
that is keeping us going, like you did yesterday.

783
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
No, it isn't. I'm not going home.

784
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
I'm not going home. Exactly.

785
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
The group's on their arse at the minute, Georgia.

786
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
The group is completely on their arse.

787
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
The results of everyone's work

788
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
and the results of everyone's emergency urine tests are back.

789
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is...

790
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,600
All 10 altogether can hear you loud and clear. Over.

791
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Paramedic Mike and survival expert Ross,

792
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
my rapid response unit on a nearby island,

793
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
have urgently asked to speak to the whole camp.

794
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I'm looking at your urine results and things.

795
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yeah, and I'm looking at your weight charts and everything.

796
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,600
And I'm looking at people whose kidney function

797
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
is on a decline.

798
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,600
And I cannot stand by and let that decline continue.

799
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Based on the fact that what I'm looking at

800
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
and what I saw the other day...

801
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
..and your dietary input,

802
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,600
it's not enough to keep you going

803
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
without causing you all, or certainly...

804
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
..a number of you, some long-term problems.

805
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Your bodies are just starting to fail at this point.

806
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Now, there's no easy way to say this.

807
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I'm teetering right on the brink

808
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,600
of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons. Over.

809
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Bloody hell.

810
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Yeah, I think everyone really understands. Over.

811
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
The solution is use the other jerry can.

812
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I can't say it any other way.

813
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
You need to be drinking, at a minimum,

814
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
three litres of water per day.

815
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Worst-case scenario, when you're all sitting in a hospital,

816
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,600
the thought of drinking out of a slightly disgusting jerry can

817
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
that's had pigs in it will not seem as bad

818
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
as potentially a lifetime on dialysis.

819
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Copy that.

820
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
If you do not get control...

821
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
..in 36 hours' time, you're out.

822
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
In 36 hours' time, you're coming off the island. Over.

823
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
There you go.

824
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,600
The women have just 36 hours to pull back from the brink.

825
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
They're not fucking about.

826
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
We are going to be pulled off this island.

827
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I mean, very fucking seriously.

828
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
I know that we all need water, full stop,

829
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
and that's the only thing that's going to stop our kidneys failing.

830
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Secondarily, let's get some regular food into us.

831
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
That's going to help with our general energy levels.

832
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
For us to get to the end of this,

833
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
it's about keeping our energy levels up

834
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
and hydration levels up

835
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,600
so that we actually survive for the next couple of days

836
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
and don't go into renal failure.

837
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
And if we don't, then we're going to be taken off

838
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
and we're all going to look like massive dickheads.

839
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I know some people are struggling more than others,

840
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
but what we need to do is, you know,

841
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600
try and work together without causing arguments,

842
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
disagreements, arguments.

843
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Unnecessary stress.

844
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Everyone's knackered, everyone is tired,

845
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,600
everyone has no energy, hasn't eaten food,

846
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,600
we're all in the same boat, but we all need to come together.

847
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Exactly. We have to get through it.

848
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
We have to pull together.

849
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
And in a way, it's going to force us to do that.

850
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,600
At times, we work as individuals and not really work as a team,

851
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
but we're going to have to. We have to work together now.

852
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
When a group faces a life-threatening crisis,

853
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
do you lie down and die, or do you pick yourself up

854
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
and determine that you're going to control your destiny?

855
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,600
You're going to go out there, you're going to be resourceful,

856
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
you're going to work hard, and you're going to turn the situation around.

857
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,600
If these women have any hope of surviving, it means teamwork,

858
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,600
and that takes courage and hard graft.

859
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
I've got to cross that swamp. Yeah.

860
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,600
With everyone agreed they need the crucial second jerrycan,

861
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Fi has volunteered to return.

862
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
They retrieve and sanitise it,

863
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
so the women can immediately double their water intake.

864
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
That can is going to be full of all sorts of shit and bugs.

865
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,600
I'm not really breathing very deeply.

866
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Rank with putrid pork, it's been sweltering in the swamp for ten days.

867
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Oh, nice. Splashed on my foot.

868
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,600
But sometimes the island can be unexpectedly generous.

869
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Not that smelly, is it?

870
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Absolutely amazing.

871
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
It doesn't smell rank on any level.

872
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Maybe the maggots have done the job.

873
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
There's a lot to be said for maggots.

874
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm so glad we got that jerrycan back, actually.

875
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Now the two-jerrycan system is back up and running,

876
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,600
the women should at last be able to hit the daily target

877
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
of three litres of water each.

878
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
So, we've got one can on the boil.

879
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
And I just want to get this one filtered.

880
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm less stressed now about the water.

881
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Just drink that anyway, shut up.

882
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Get it down you.

883
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'll just squeeze a wee out.

884
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Thank God.

885
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
But I don't want to...

886
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm not leaving.

887
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,600
We've been walking too long before we find some yucca.

888
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
With the water production line back on a roll,

889
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Jamie is happy to return to work,

890
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
joining forces with Lauren and Beth

891
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
to find some fresh water to drink.

892
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
It's been a long journey.

893
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
She's joined forces with Lauren and Beth

894
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
to find carbohydrates the group urgently needs.

895
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
God, I can barely walk.

896
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
It's really hard.

897
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
It's hard, you know, being in a group

898
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
and put under so much stress.

899
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
And nobody's perfect.

900
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Everybody has their moments.

901
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
But we have to stick together as a team.

902
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Our muscles are stronger.

903
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
I can see some yucca.

904
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
What have you got there?

905
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Woo!

906
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Boom!

907
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Woo-hoo!

908
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Oh!

909
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Woo-hoo!

910
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

911
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Yeeees!

912
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Woo-hoo!

913
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

914
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Yeah, we're cooking on gas now, girls.

915
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Look, once you see one, you see them all.

916
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Oh, my.

917
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
A lot.

918
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Small but perfectly formed.

919
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Uh-oh.

920
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Lauren has always.

921
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
The girls got yucca.

922
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Yeah, we got yucca.

923
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Woo!

924
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
That's amazing, Lauren.

925
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Yeah, Lauren!

926
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Yes, not just me.

927
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
High-five!

928
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Yay!

929
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Check out my yucca.

930
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Do you like a piece of my yucca?

931
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
In and around all night.

932
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Please, you're right on the edge. It's freaking me out.

933
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
It's all right, love.

934
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,600
A rehydrated Julie is with Georgie and Beth,

935
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,600
determined to finally land that elusive fish for supper.

936
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
OK, another little fishy.

937
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,600
And they've come up with a new way to attract fish,

938
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
a sparkling lure.

939
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
And that is a state-of-the-art bit of fishing kit there.

940
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Fishing tackle. Right.

941
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Coca-Cola, give us some luck.

942
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,600
If I get pulled in, I'm going to swim round that way.

943
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
You won't.

944
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,600
I'm so cack-handed at everything.

945
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Ooh!

946
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
I can see, like...

947
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Ooh!

948
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Ooh!

949
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
As hard as you can.

950
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Oh!

951
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

952
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Caught a fish! Is it alive?

953
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Well done, Julie!

954
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Oh, my God! I thought you were going to...

955
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Sucker!

956
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Dinner!

957
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Basically, whatever it takes to stay.

958
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Whatever it takes.

959
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Go on, Georgie.

960
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Go on, Jules.

961
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
We'll trade that fisherman to give us some fish.

962
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Hola!

963
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Hola!

964
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
He's coming.

965
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Not content with just one small fish, Julie spots another opportunity,

966
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,600
the first passing boat the women have seen in these waters.

967
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I don't know, Jules, it's your turn to get the backs out.

968
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,600
He's not going to want to see a 55-year-old's backs.

969
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
I don't know, mate, your backs are way better than mine.

970
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,600
You have fish?

971
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
You have fish?

972
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
One fish?

973
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Fish!

974
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
We have none.

975
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
We have none. No fish.

976
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
He's going to throw it!

977
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, you're very, very kind.

978
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Whoa!

979
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Thank you very much.

980
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Thank you.

981
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Bless you. Bless you.

982
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
Good luck.

983
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Gracias, amigo!

984
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Now, I think that is...

985
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Ah!

986
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I think that is a...

987
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Barracuda.

988
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

989
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Ah!

990
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
I could just go, ah!

991
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
And bite it and eat it raw.

992
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
I'm so hungry.

993
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I don't know whether that was actually playing by Queensberry rules,

994
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
but innovation, innovation, innovation.

995
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,600
Whoo!

996
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
We caught a fish!

997
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Yeah!

998
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Oh, my God, it's massive!

999
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Whoo!

1000
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
This is a Barracuda.

1001
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Barracuda.

1002
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Barracuda.

1003
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Barracuda.

1004
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Barracuda.

1005
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Barracuda.

1006
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Barracuda.

1007
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Yeah!

1008
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Barracuda.

1009
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Oh, my God, you guys are incredible.

1010
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Incredible, I love it.

1011
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Smells amazing.

1012
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,600
We should have got this place licked.

1013
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
You know, ten women, hey,

1014
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,600
this place should have been ship-shaped.

1015
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Tragically, not the case.

1016
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
There's the hero of the moment.

1017
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I don't even want to talk.

1018
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,840
I don't even want a twirl. It's still tasty.

1019
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,400
But at least we've started now.

1020
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,280
Not too late.

1021
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,160
Next time on The Men's Island.

1022
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,360
It's little old me.

1023
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,960
Unfortunately, I don't trust you.

1024
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,440
Whoa!

1025
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,000
There's a death trap round here.

1026
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,120
Snake!

1027
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,960
Okay.

1028
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,400
We have no food.

1029
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,240
Stop it!

1030
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
Holy shit!

1031
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,200
THE MEN'S ISLAND
