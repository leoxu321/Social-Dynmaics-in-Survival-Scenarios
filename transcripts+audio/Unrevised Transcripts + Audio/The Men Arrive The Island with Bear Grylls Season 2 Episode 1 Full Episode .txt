two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women when pushed to the limits of
human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the winds a day who will have what it
takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men Britain today we've never been further from a
hunter-gatherer origins but I want to know when stripped of everything
has modern man still got that instinct to survive
to find out a marooning 14 ordinary men on a desert island this is crazy this is absolutely
crazy this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever
they'll have to endure six weeks in the height of the harsh tropical storm season
this is the worst you can do
they'll be utterly alone filming everything themselves we have two choices one we go down
the 40-foot Ravine holy well we keep going through this of a jungle they'll have to find their own
water and hunt for their own food we've just got a prehistoric animal you lazy bunch of bone idle
bastards have these modern day men got what it takes to survive
that's the hardest thing I've done
I personally don't think men are as strong now as they were I wouldn't even say 50 years ago even
five years ago because we have it too easy the interesting question to ask actually is if we
lost everything what would happen to us it'd be nice to think I've come off the island feeling
a little bit more macho a little bit more alpha male a little bit more popular with the ladies
I'm about to abandon these men on a remote Pacific island to see if they can survive
they will be utterly alone my oldest was 19.
he only needs me for money in a lift and the youngest one's too cool to hang around with
dad my dream is for them guys to go that's my dad that that's fantastic my dad did that
I don't think I've done anything that's put myself at risk really but I'm scared he's
taking a graphic designer on an island with no other skills whatsoever anything could happen
these 14 ordinary men do not know each other and they have no experience in living in the wild
at the moment I don't enjoy day-to-day life
I've got a stressful job I've got a newborn baby at home I want to go on the island to
get away from the day-to-day I think everyone in life does take certain things for
granted electricity when you turn on the light having a warm shower having breakfast when it's
not there and you wake up in the morning and go where's the next meal coming from it's a man test
isn't it okay guys we're getting closer you are very remote here the next stop that way is New Zealand
out is has all of this cushioning that civilization has experienced over the last 50 years made us
totally lose touch with that survival instinct that I believe is deep within us all okay guys
I need you to be my eyes for any rocks and loads of rocks it takes an extreme situation to find out
what people are really made of what you're about to embark on it will be the toughest thing you will
do this all right you can do it the men's home for the next six weeks is an uninhabited island
in a remote Pacific archipelago the 11 kilometers of coastline is dominated by treacherous cliffs and
rocky headlands vicious swells and powerful ocean currents means there's no easy way onto
the island I'm gonna try and get you guys as close as I can all right
but you will end up swimming any of you guys are weak swimmers it is a good time to say I've never
swam this distance before not even a swimming pool but I will get there I will get there age won't
stop me doing this not often in one's life someone actually challenges your morals challenges you
physically and this does that's why I want to do it who can't swim confidently confident with
unconfident yeah let's go
the men must make the 75 meter swim to the island fully closed
help each other help those who are weaker let's go let's go
strong undercurrents mean the men need to get to shore as quickly as possible
go get out of the water go go go
out of the water go see if they can
wow that was the damnedest thing I ever did
I couldn't have gone much further but that's only a taste of what we've got to come then bring it children yeah well the advice is
take your own piss which is a bit unnerving with only two days survival training initiative will be key
essentially it's water isn't it is that your favorite��요
You've got to save your piss, mate. You've got to save your piss.
Yeah, yeah. Save your piss.
Drink your own piss!
I hope not.
So, they look a bit like a party of drowned rats at the moment.
Kind of let the chaos begin.
But what I do know is, when I return in six weeks' time,
the 14 men, if there are still 14 men there,
which, to be honest, I doubt,
the men that do remain...
..will be changed.
It's time for me and the crew to leave.
We won't be back until the end of the experiment.
For the next six weeks,
the men will have to live entirely on their own wits.
To make sure these men at least have a fighting chance at survival,
I've ensured the island's got enough water,
indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive.
It's teeming with wildlife.
But what they've got to have is the ingenuity
to find it,
catch it and kill it.
What's your name, mate?
Paul.
I'm Ross.
Hello, Ross.
From here on in,
everything you see will be filmed by the men themselves.
Why don't we get everybody together
and then we'll work out something that we're going to do
and then we're all going to be heading that way,
I'm assuming, anyway,
because it looks a little bit safer than this,
cos it'll be dark soon.
Come on, lads, let's make use of some of this energy while we've got it.
All of the men will film,
but four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.
I'm Ross.
Sam.
How you doing, mate?
Who'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.
Oh, I'm like a fucking mule arse, aren't I?
The brains of a donkey!
Obviously, because we are having to film everything ourselves,
we've got to cart all of the camera gear, batteries and everything with us.
Let's do it.
Let's get on with it.
For fuck's sake, this is survival, not Good Morning Britain.
As well as the camera equipment, they'll have a medical kit,
two jerry cans containing a day's supply of water,
basic fishing equipment and a handful of tools.
Guys, how many knives do we have? Let's count them in.
Three knives, three machetes.
Three knives, that's easy.
So, I'll gather round in one group, guys.
I'm Barney and I'm a paramedic from Leicester.
I'm Andy Bennett, builder for Milton Keynes.
We've got a fucking builder, everybody!
Let's hope he's not a cowboy.
My name's Piers, I am a doctor.
I'm Kyle and I'm a website consultant.
My name's Paul, I invented the dice.
I'm a construction contract manager.
It's 4pm. With only two hours of daylight remaining,
the men's priority has to be finding a safe place to shelter for the night.
If they can't, they'll have to sleep rough on the jungle floor,
alongside potentially deadly scorpions, snakes and caiman crocodiles.
We're assuming that the north side of the island
would be nice beachy, sandy, flat seas.
Paul thinks the group's best option is a beach.
Let's go.
And he's convinced they have time to cross the island
to find one before dark.
Who else was imagining sunny beaches
when they thought about coming out here?
These trees here are very sharp.
There you go.
I believe it will now be referred to as the porcupine tree.
Vicious.
The interior of the island is three square kilometres
of mangrove swamp and unbroken jungle.
And I know from experience
that moving through dense island undergrowth
is a slow, exhausting work.
It will do all you can to stop you in your tracks.
And often, the harder you push, the harder it pushes back.
Whoa! Stop!
There's a snake down here.
It's a boa, isn't it?
Take its head off if it's a decent size, mate.
Get stuck in.
Is anyone going to help me?
I'm trying to carry a bag and a machete and kill a snake.
He's looking pretty aggressive. He's coiling, isn't he?
I need a long stick just to put on its head.
Mind you, no snake.
Mind you...
No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that, for fuck's sake.
Listen, should we just throw this case on it?
No.
Part of me thinks, should we just leave it?
Didn't even flinch, did it?
Yeah, yeah, let's keep going.
If we don't get out of this shrub,
we're going to be sleeping here tonight.
It ain't safe and it's not cool.
With just an hour to go until nightfall,
the men have covered barely 400 metres.
Paul!
Yes?
You going to come and get a drink?
The darker it's getting,
the more it's getting a little bit worrying.
Tap on it when you're done.
Somehow I've fallen into chief navigator mode,
but I'm on it.
My days are very stressful.
It really doesn't fucking matter.
I don't give a fuck.
A lot of the time I think that most people are fucking idiots.
Just get that load out, get that load out.
You can't build the internal walls anyway.
Being called a bastard is just a friendly greeting
in the building industry.
Get in there and get it done.
This experience might change me.
Hopefully for the better.
It might make me be a little bit more tolerant of other people.
Come on, fuckers.
This is going to take us fucking hours.
Yeah, it's about to get darker and darker as well.
Yeah, I know, so that's why we've just got to get through it.
We need to start to think,
do we want to be hacking through this stuff
when it's pitch black,
or the next time we see a clearing,
are we going to think about settling down for the night?
Mate, I personally want to just plough on and make it.
I mean, it's going to get darker in here
quicker than it is on the beach.
I say we plough on.
This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy.
I don't know what to say right now.
I never had the money to go travelling.
I've never done anything that's been a bit sort of edgy,
that's been a bit...
..dangerous, I guess.
I don't think I'm as confident as I was
as I say I am,
and I think a lot of what I do can be a front.
The sort of persona of alpha male to me
is everything my stepdad was.
I saw enough of him growing up to realise who not to be.
I guess it's time to find out who I really am.
Keep coming! We're only 100 metres away!
It keeps saying it's like the beach is 100 metres away.
It's all getting a little bit pissed off
because we've been walking for about fucking miles
and it's not here.
The temperatures are freeing.
It's like 51-year-old builder Andy is struggling to keep up.
At the moment, it's like every man for himself.
For fuck's sake.
First.
Cut.
We've not even made any ground
and we are all...fucked.
Joe, pop Randy and help you.
He's got a really awkward box on his arm.
I know it's a ball-legged kid,
but you're carrying one of the fucking easiest things in the world.
I'm a fuck.
I know it's heavy.
I'm a fuck, pal. No, I'm not.
But it's easy.
You want to carry this bag?
It's fucked.
I'll swap you now, mate, if you want.
At the front, Paul pushes on, despite the group's growing descent.
Have we got lights in those cameras, Sam?
Bit of infrared.
How you doing, mate?
Some people ain't playing ball.
In what way? What do you mean?
Oh.
Cracking on with fuck all, you know?
We could all do that, like a hero with a machete.
Come on.
For fuck's sake.
I know we all want to get on, but...
you've got to think of everybody else now. We're a team.
You can't just be selfish, you know?
Oh, there's a bit of light, look.
This is amazing.
I've found the sea.
Ah.
Ah.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh.
Yeah, it's a good beach.
Come on.
Hooray, boys.
Come on.
Booyah.
Beach.
Ha, ha.
Pina coladas.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's the hardest thing I've ever done.
Come on.
Come on.
Fuck.
I never thought I'd be so happy to see the beach in my entire life.
Well done, mate. Well done.
Fuck.
Nice one, mate.
Oh.
I never doubted myself.
Never underestimate your own abilities.
The sun's just beginning to set, so we're just in time.
And everyone is on such a high right now.
That's a whale.
It's a whale.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
We're still there watching the sunset, and there's whales swimming past us.
Pretty cool.
You don't get that often, do you?
You're right.
About two minutes sleep, I think.
One time, huh?
16 hours ago, I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote desert island.
I haven't slept for a minute.
Not a minute.
They have spent their first night on the beach with no shelter.
Is that really shit?
Oh, what have we done?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
You never get that realization.
You've done something you didn't quite think all the way through.
At one point, I was shitting if we were going to get washed away.
I was like, did it get that close?
I mean, you can see the line, mate.
You can see the line.
The line's, what, three foot away from where we were?
Look at the amount of rubbish on this beach.
Has anyone found a left shoe?
Yeah, but these, I'm not too sure if I'm going to go for these.
What are you?
A bit last season.
Hey, lads.
Look.
Found a pink pair.
These are bloody comfortable.
Look at these bad boys.
This is the male version.
The men came onto the island with just a day's supply of drinking water.
Mouthfuls.
But after yesterday's arduous trek in 34-degree heat, it's all but gone.
Tropical storm season.
Really, there shouldn't be any shortage of water.
And obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.
But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.
All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.
From experience, I can tell you, animals aren't fussy about where they crap.
Oh, my God.
Look at all the crap that's in there.
That's fucking horrible.
Without boiling, this rancid water would almost certainly give the men stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
It's not salty, but...
I'll tell you what.
I've had hangover shits that smell better than that.
Guys, can we...
Why don't we all kind of gather in and have some sort of conflab about what we're going to do today?
Yeah, I think that might be a very good idea, please.
Go on, guys.
Gather round.
You want a plan of action, lads?
Yeah.
We 100% need to try and make a fire now.
If we don't make a fire and something to boil new water, we are going to be in bad shape by tomorrow morning.
Food is becoming a priority very quickly.
For a lot of people, we're going to have to get something substantial to eat fairly soon.
Right.
Meet and adjourn.
Shall we dance, sir?
Is that ready?
Let's go.
The men decide to split up.
Having eaten nothing since they arrived, the majority of the group head off to look for food,
while engineer Dan and builder Andy take on the fire lighting.
It's quite a lot of pressure to get this fire going.
You're down?
I'm up.
Yeah.
To me?
To me.
Awesome.
That is not an ideal start, is it?
That did one stroke.
Oh, lads.
I shot my load.
Round about here, there's about six, maybe ten snails and shit, yeah?
Along the coast, 47-year-old Vic has decided to put Joe, the group's youngest member, to work.
We should definitely have put some fucking shoes on.
That might have been a wise idea, fella.
Oh!
Just anything.
Limpets, crabs, give them a crack.
Snails.
You spot them, fella, and I'll club them.
Do these snails bite?
I feel as though something with legs is going to come out of there, innit?
A nippy.
Don't put your finger where you won't put your dick, because it might get bit.
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the nearest we get to Michelin star.
Will we put it on a bed of anything?
One.
A morning's hard graft provides nothing more than a handful of limpets.
Give it a good old cheer.
Fucking hell.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tough.
Limpets.
Limpets are horrendous.
You don't buy them in supermarkets, do you?
So they're not known for being very nice.
I don't think they're very nice at all.
For now, the men will have to go hungry.
Stop.
Who said there's no smoke without fire?
Lying bastards.
The fire's pissed me off a little bit.
I just don't know what we're doing wrong.
Lighting a fire has become an urgent priority.
It's 34 degrees in the shade,
and the men have had little to drink in the past 12 hours.
We've literally, we've got no water.
None at all?
None.
I had a piss 20 minutes ago,
and it was like pissing lion's golden syrup.
I had to push it out.
That is not viscous and clear.
No, it's definitely not.
The men are starting to show the telltale signs of serious dehydration.
Thirsty, really bloody thirsty.
Gone out of me.
I said, fuck off.
The vultures are circling already.
Look at the size of that.
Jesus.
That's prehistoric.
How about your glasses?
Do you reckon we can...
Can I try your glasses?
Try it, mate.
Yeah.
With their need for fire now critical,
web consultant Kyle,
has an idea he wants to try.
We've got Andy's glasses.
Just basically using the sun to focus at one point
is giving us quite a lot of heat.
Come on.
Come on.
Hoping that's going to work, the old glasses.
Let go, let go.
Oh, go on, Andy lad.
Sticks.
Get the little sticks.
Preparation.
Where's the next last stick?
Where's the rest of the shit?
Where's the rest of the stuff?
Sticks.
Fucking sticks.
Get up there.
Get up there.
Swipe right side.
Swipe right side.
All right.
Put it off.
Put it off.
Real tight.
Breathe it.
Go on, Andy.
Go on, son.
Go on, son.
Go on.
Slow.
Slow hard.
Slow hard.
He'll go.
Come on.
That's it.
Come on.
It's nigger there.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Sticks.
Twigs.
You got it.
The little twigs.
Yeah.
Twigs.
Yeah, twigs.
Found you.
Twigs.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Yeah.
There we go.
Bingo.
Well done, you two.
It was Kyle that started it.
Good.
Of course it was.
He showed me the way and I followed through.
I see.
We've done well.
We got there.
Absolutely brilliant.
Well done.
What a dark horse.
Excuse the pun.
We all take it back about the IT guy.
Fucking yes.
Well done, Kyle.
After eight hours of trying, the men finally have a fire on which to boil the stagnant water.
I'm going to drink and drink and drink until my piss falls clear.
And your verdict is?
I mean, it's almost like normal water.
There's a bit of sort of pond in there.
That is top notch.
It doesn't taste like piss, does it?
It tastes like metal weight tea.
As long as the fire stays lit, the men will have a source of safety.
They have a source of safe drinking water.
A little bit of that.
A little bit of that.
One achievement there.
But keeping it alight during tropical storm season will be a huge challenge.
Shit.
Look at that rain.
So look like right there, tropical paradise.
And then there.
Shit hole.
Shit hole.
It's like Waitrose and Aldi all in one picture.
What I'm worried about is that this hot shoe is still wet.
Oh shit.
Right here?
It's not wet.
It's just cold.
But it's not like the weather.
The temperature is protect us from cold.
What I'm worried about is everyone's off doing other things,
and in a minute, it's going to be pissing down with rain.
I actually think it'd be quite important to build a shelter for the fire.
I've not got the energy to build a shelter or anything at the moment.
If I could, I would, I promise you.
A little bit worried about Andy.
He seems to have separated himself from the group a little bit.
When everybody's together, he walks off.
He's now making a bed over there, which just seems a bit childish.
Feels like he doesn't want to be part of the group.
Hey, hey, I've got a bed.
All I want to do at the moment is get some sleep.
Just some, you know?
I think middle age has made me boring.
I've got a beautiful wife, lovely house, nice job, etc.
All the stuff that most people strive to get.
And yet I'm still searching for something.
Perhaps all men get like that, I don't know.
Perhaps I make a mid-life crisis.
I don't like myself as much as I used to, put it that way.
I think I need a new adventure, to put that right.
Do you want to help us get a sink, just to cover this up?
Cos it's going out already.
An hour before sunset...
The heavens have opened, as expected.
We've got a fire going.
Yeah, but we've got to put...
This is brilliant.
However, it is now pissing down with rain.
We've got no cover over it whatsoever.
We've got nowhere to sleep whatsoever.
So I would say our priority is shelter.
Honestly, in the politest way possible,
we need to cover up this fucking fire cos it's going to go out.
Without the fire, the men will have no means of purifying water to drink.
Who is doing the leaves? Is anybody getting the leaves to cover this?
That is going out in about half an hour.
Yeah, clusterfuck. Or foovar. I don't know what the correct military term is.
So now we've got a million people trying to do a million things.
Hopefully we'll have a million answers.
George is fucking mad.
This rain is absolutely unbelievable.
You don't ever see rain like this in the UK.
Absolutely, completely...
Stoking.
8pm.
The men are still desperately trying to make a watertight shelter
to save their fire.
Over and under. That's it.
See if we can bend it, Bart.
In this part of the Pacific, storms can last for days
and dump inches of rain in an hour.
It's a great night.
Obviously, we're staying dry under the shelter that we've made.
It's a good job we made it, otherwise we'd be absolutely saturated right now.
The roof might need possibly a tweak or two.
There is a minor bit of snagging before practical completion.
It's just something simple like perhaps taking the whole fucking thing down and redoing it.
Has anyone checked on Andy?
Fuck, we've got one.
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
We've got a headlight, guys.
Andy chose to not help the group in any way, shape or form.
And went off on his own.
Andy's here.
Vicky and Andy's here under the tree.
I think Andy needs to get a little bit more involved with this all, to be honest.
It absolutely pissed down last night.
Everyone was awake and everyone was just so wet through.
I was sat there and I was just thinking, what am I doing here?
I feel kind of pissed.
Yeah. It's weird.
Yeah.
I feel like...
I've had a couple of pints.
I can't move my legs.
I've sat up, I just can't move.
Has the bed paralysed you?
Yeah. That's great.
Completely numb from cocked down.
6am.
Last night, a violent tropical storm battered the island.
After a desperate struggle, the group managed to save their fire
with a small temporary shelter.
But the men themselves had no protection from the elements.
Video diary.
I don't know what day it is.
I don't know if it's day two, day three.
Still no sleep after getting on the island.
I think I've had about, honestly, swear to God, an hour's sleep.
I can't do it.
I've got to think about myself now, you know?
Yeah. I've been up all fucking night.
I'm a mess because of it.
Sleep really is critical to survival
because it affects our physical and our mental health.
When you get enough of it, it helps your body to recover,
to heal, you process thoughts, process memories,
but when you don't get enough of it, that's when you become careless,
it affects your decision-making abilities
and it can even lead to depression.
How you doing, fella?
Ooh. What's up?
I'm struggling a bit, I think.
At the moment. With?
The mentality of it all.
You know what I mean? You've got to get yourself in, like...
..in the zone, as it were, and I'm struggling to find the zone, at the moment.
I'm really worried about Joe.
He's just kind of wandering around, sitting down, head in his hands.
I kind of think he's feeling sorry for himself, really,
and he's obviously missing home.
What's her name? Charlotte.
SHE SIGHS
Maximum three. You miss her, mate, don't you?
So, he made it in two.
SHE SIGHS
Yeah.
Yeah.
Best thing that happened to me, though.
How long have you been together? Five years.
For the first time ever, since I met her,
that I've gone 24 hours without speaking to her, so...
In fact, you might...
Come on, dude, hug it out!
You'll be fine, mate, you'll be absolutely fine, honestly.
You'll be fine, honestly.
HE SIGHS
If I don't have a good night's sleep fairly soon,
I'm going to end up throttling someone inadvertently.
I'm not joking.
I'll lose my rag.
I don't want a bed to sleep in.
I'm not going to get soaking wet.
SHE SIGHS
The group are relying on their two builders, Andy and Paul,
to construct a new watertight shelter.
But both have a very different idea about where to put it.
We need to pick a location to build this shelter on.
Correct.
We have two potential locations.
Andy, is your place on the beach?
Yeah.
SHE SIGHS
I can put any of these little bits of thicket and brush
into it easily.
Look, we've got a pit there for a fire pit.
This is an absolutely perfect camp.
Job's good.
This is not Andy's, is it?
You're more exposed to the tides, you're more exposed to the weather,
and we're going to get bitten to smotherings by sandflies.
It's not an option. No way.
Andy's camp, it looks like it'll flood at the tidal surge,
there's plastic bottles everywhere, I think we'll get bitten to shit.
Pointless. Give me my opinion, mate.
Fucking nobody listened to fucking me.
I would love to have come down here for Andy's sake and gone,
this is fucking brilliant, mate.
But the trouble is, we walked in here and I kept my mouth shut,
but within 30 seconds, everyone went, are you fucking joking?
I'm a builder. People get me in to fix anything.
Customers phone me up to put their IKEA bedroom stuff together.
It's like, well, fuck you then.
With Andy's site rejected, Paul shows the men his preferred location.
Because it's elevated, this is not really going to be good.
It's not really going to get that wet.
It's got a fairly good canopy. We can all sleep here on the dry.
Correct. You've got a nice little breeze coming through as well.
Yeah, I like this place.
Now, what do you want me to do, Paul?
Well, what we need now are the cross members.
I've bitched about Paul being a volcanic rhinoceros,
but you know what, he's single-minded,
but he makes clear decisions and sticks by them,
and he's been right more than he's been wrong so far.
Ah!
We're fucking saved. We'll be all right now.
We knew there was power on the island.
How are you finding it?
A bit shocked at how... Difficult.
..how difficult it's been.
We're all here doing the same shit.
We're all not sure whether we should see it or not.
Determined to boost Joe's morale and keep his mind off home,
father of three, Vic, has asked him to join in with the shelter build.
It's a challenge.
We'll adapt to all this, quicker than any of us will.
Far quicker.
It's a case of making sure everybody guides everybody else
in the right direction.
I do firmly believe we will become an excellent team,
er, to the point of becoming almost like a tribe.
Can we just say, building camp at the top of a steep hill
in the middle of rainy season is the stupidest idea
we've ever had?
Yeah.
Ever had.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
And I'm obviously the weakest link.
Joe, you're not the weakest link, you're just missing home.
It's a natural thing to feel.
I think some people do think I'm the weakest link, mate.
Do you think that?
I don't think so.
No, but I think you do.
Do you think so? Yeah.
Crikey, what's made you think that?
Day one when I met you, you've been shouting orders at me from day dot.
Have I? No.
We're carrying stuff in and out of a jungle
and I've got a really heavy rucksack on my back
and you're saying, Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do this.
Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do that.
I don't know if it happens to anyone else,
but I think you feel that I'm the youngest,
therefore, naturally, you've got some authority over me.
And that's been grinding on me a little bit.
Joe intimated that I'd been giving him a hard time,
which I truly have only tried to be positive with everybody.
I was devastated.
You're being aggressive. I'm telling you what.
You're being passive aggressive and that's not fair.
All right?
He just told me I'm being passive aggressive
while we're having a laugh.
I'm being passive aggressive.
I'm being passive aggressive.
I'm being passive aggressive, you know.
However bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity.
Survival is about dogged determination,
learning from your failures and never giving up.
Churchill once said a great quote.
He said, if you're going through hell, keep going.
My balls are doing the backstroke in a bucket of sand.
I'm hungry. I'm tired.
All that's going through my head is, I don't self-arm at home,
so why the hell am I self-arming out here?
6am.
I've never been in an environment where last night you hear a thunderstorm
and it's now daylight and it's still thundering and it's still raining.
Overnight, torrential rain has once again battered the island.
The men have managed to protect the fire, but their spirits are low.
It is a bit mind-boggling that you can have this much rain in so long.
It just keeps coming.
Yesterday, the men started work on a new shelter.
But only half built, it was no match for the elements.
I'm massively underestimated at this place. Massively.
I'm so scared of hiking for as long as I can remember.
Last night, when I got my first Hunger Rumble,
it was playing on my mind a lot more.
It's hard.
This is apocalyptic weather.
It's going to threaten to wash us out of this camp.
For the third night in a row, the men have barely slept.
The positive? It's daytime.
I can see how crap it is.
Here in the tropics, when it rains...
It's not just nice British drizzle, it's torrential.
We can hardly hold a conversation.
You've got to spend so much time and energy trying to keep your fire alight
when you could be out there fishing or hunting or making shelters.
However strong and determined, after a while, it saps you.
It saps your spirit in the same way it saps a life out of a fire.
I cannot face another day on here. Honestly, I can't.
I'm at the stage of almost a breakdown, to be totally honest.
You just can't imagine.
I can't imagine how tough it is.
Unbelievable.
The island's youngest member, Joe, says he's had enough.
Four weeks, I think, would be a push for me.
Six weeks, anything I'd ever make.
The pain that I'm going to go through here,
leaving the loved ones at home, Charlotte, all the rest of it...
Then why did you sign up?
I don't know.
10am. The storm finally passes.
Determined to leave as soon as possible,
graphic designer Joe uses the emergency satellite radio
to request an evacuation boat.
I just really strongly believe that as a person,
physically, mentally and all the rest of it,
I'm not going to make the rest of the time on the island.
And I've not made any rash decisions, cos I'm aware that you can make decisions
in the heat of a moment.
And I haven't.
I just really fancy a margarita pizza.
Joe wants to go home.
I can't believe it.
He's not been here four days.
He's not even started and he wants to go home.
Joe has agreed to stay on the island for another 24 hours
before making a final decision about whether he wants to leave.
You hold it up there, mark it and then we'll cut it.
Is it long enough?
No.
You can go halfway there.
You can go halfway there.
In the jungle, work continues on the shelter.
Can you get that any higher?
The group have persuaded Andy to help out,
hoping the prospect of a dry night will encourage him to stay.
One there.
Yeah.
And then one down here.
Right, so not there then?
Eh?
So not there then?
I didn't say to put it there.
The whole reason I said I don't want to tie a sled knot in this piece
is because we need to get the piece of wood in there first.
Paul is a project manager in a construction company
and Andy is a builder.
Them two personalities just clash
because one wants to tell the other one what to do
and then this one wants to tell this one what to do.
All we need to do is tie this on here, please.
That's all we need to do.
Where's the bit of wood?
Because I'm not tying a fucking knot if there ain't a bit of wood in it.
Look, that ain't going nowhere.
That's the shape I want.
Andy really has a massive problem with me.
Everybody's been tip-toeing around me for the past four days.
It's just been a fucking prick.
But what can you do?
Something's just going to explode at some point.
Since yesterday, Andy has been hinting
that he too might request evacuation from the island.
Why are you threatening to go home, Andy?
All sorts of reasons, mate.
Come on, spit us out.
No, I don't need to.
Why are you so aggressive?
I'm asking you a simple question.
Yeah, you've asked me it three times.
The first time should have been enough.
Then the second time.
Now you're asking a fourth time.
No, they were different questions.
And then you're calling me aggressive
because I don't want to answer a question that you've asked four times.
I haven't asked it four times.
You have.
I said, why do you want to go home?
You went, because I do.
I went, well, give us a reason.
You went, I'm not going to give you a reason.
Exactly.
So then you asked again.
There must be a reason.
And then you asked again.
I didn't ask again, Andy.
You did.
What is the fucking matter with you?
Nothing the matter with me, son.
At all.
Do we wedge that there and then prop it up?
Whatever Andy wants to do.
I've had enough.
Hang on.
We need your expertise.
I said, stop asking me.
And he carried on asking me.
Fucking unbelievable.
With the camp's two builders walking off the job,
construction of the shelter grinds to a halt.
There's no doubt there's a lot of strong, pretty macho personalities on the men's island.
And yeah, they're all trying to find their place in that pecking order.
But the danger when you get these high pressure situations like this is that the alpha males
start to compete instead of cooperate.
And then the danger is it blows a whole group apart.
I'm used to being in control.
I'm used to being organized, everything running efficiently.
It's what I do.
That ignorant twat wants to do it his way.
Yeah.
I have no fucking clue.
It makes your head.
It's like it wants to implode.
Seriously, my world is a punch to the throat.
He's down.
Gone.
Finished.
It's over with.
I walk away.
Happy days.
I can't do that here.
Bang.
Done.
Fat cunt.
You know what I mean?
There's a lot of bad blood in camp at the minute, largely between Paul and Andy.
We've got enough on our plate in this island without alpha male dick swinging.
I think everyone just needs to man the fuck up, really.
I just feel like everything I do, mate, he's just there, ready to fucking knock it down,
you know, or criticize.
It's like, fuck off, you know?
If he goes, I'll stay.
People might make problems.
So I overheard a conversation with Andy.
His exact words were,
if Paul leaves, that would be good because then I will stay.
I'm not dealing with that sort of immaturity.
He's supposed to be a grown man.
I'm not being blackmailed.
I don't need to be surrounded by this immaturity.
I might just have to go.
Are you thinking about fucking off?
Can't be fucking bothered.
Mate, you can't go, mate.
You literally can't go.
Do you think that you would regret it later on?
You will regret it.
I think I won't.
Just suck it up, mate.
Lift up your skirt.
Wash the sand out of your vagina, mate.
In a disastrous turn of events,
three men, including the island's two builders,
are now threatening to walk.
Andy, Paul and Joe all want to leave this island.
I'm amazed that they've come this far
and want to give up so early.
As yet another storm hits the island,
the men call a crisis meeting.
I know it sounds cutthroat,
but we need to keep as many of those guys here as we can.
But for any of them to change their mind is a win.
There's been so much discussion about people leaving.
My personal opinion is that we are stronger together
than we are apart.
Agreed.
Joe, my hope is that you might have thought differently...
We've already done this.
I've already had the chat with everyone.
People have already said their thoughts.
I've already said my thoughts, but...
On that note,
I will be saying no more.
I'll just be waiting for the boat to arrive and to leave, OK?
Paul, would you just let us know
how you're feeling at the moment?
I came to this island as a bit of a release,
you know, to get away from my everyday life.
I'm not really confrontational.
I don't like having arguments with people.
I'd rather just step away from the situation.
The final nail in the coffin was to hear somebody say
that it was good that I was going,
which I thought was a bit of a shame,
but in another way, it confirmed my decision.
And in that case, that's why I decided to go.
If one goes, there's no point in the other going.
Right, here we go.
How we make that decision...
Here we go.
This is now we're getting to the country.
He's segregated himself from the group from day one.
We're having a discussion, he doesn't want to know.
We haven't got any beds, he makes himself a bed.
He goes off in socks.
Somehow, that's my fault.
I've had no sleep the whole day.
Neither has anybody.
You've been sleeping.
Sorry, mate, you've been sleeping.
Andy, nobody's had any sleep.
As a group, no-one here has had enough sleep
to give them the energy to do what they're about to do the next day.
So you pointing a finger at me and saying,
well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.
I've been having a laugh up until I heard
one of my team-mates say they wanted me to go.
I was having a right crack.
Now I'm not.
In a community, not everyone gets on,
and that is a fact of life.
We can't change that.
So let's build our community.
You and you, just keep your distance.
At least we're together.
We're two men up.
We can build a shelter in a day
rather than taking two days with two men down.
The big strong man and the builder.
If you two fuck off, then we're fucked, aren't we?
See, I don't want to lose two builders,
regardless of your characters.
We need you to stay.
I'm going to walk away, and then that would hopefully...
No, listen.
So Andy can engage.
Enjoy his experience, and hopefully five.
Then you're not losing two people, are you?
You're losing one.
I'm leaving the island.
Whether Paul leaves or not.
Whether Paul leaves or not.
I would rather Paul stay.
He's a stronger man than me.
He'll be more benefit to you.
But either way, I'm sorry, I'm going.
For him to fucking say, I'm glad he's going, good,
then I'll stay, then all of a sudden
he hasn't got his own way again,
and it's, oh, I'm going, there's other reasons.
It's fucking immaturity.
It's sulking, and it's attention-seeking.
And you don't want to be scapegoated, I realise this.
Pollocks, absolute pollocks. I'm not having it.
I am going off this island,
because I'm not being held responsible for that.
End of story.
Next time on The Women's Island...
Oh, my God!
A huge fucking snake came towards me!
Fucking hell!
At the minute, we are barely coping
with the situation in which we find ourselves.
Oh, shit, no, wait, sit forward.
We have nothing to drink.
We don't know where we are.
Hello!
