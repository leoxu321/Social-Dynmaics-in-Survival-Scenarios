1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,400
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,760
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,560
filming everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:51,500
for your boys or mental strength the Windsor day oh my god oh my god who will have what it

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,900
takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men's island

7
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,920
you're on

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,200
like actually could have died survival will be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,840
and harsh tropical storm season everyone's aware everyone's cold everyone's miserable everyone's

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,120
tired they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food what the effing hell is

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,820
that have these modern-day men got what it takes to survive and survive and survive and survive and

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,980
survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,920
and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive you are three and a half hour making

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:32,940
you are three and a half hour making

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,880
you are three and a half hour making soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:34,900
soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,960
soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell any Chef that cooking for 11 people is

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,000
any Chef that cooking for 11 people is

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,460
any Chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy and your stabbing

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:54,620
three weeks ago fourteen British men

21
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,640
three weeks ago fourteen British men

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,920
three weeks ago fourteen British men were cast away on this remote Pacific

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:56,940
were cast away on this remote Pacific

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,840
were cast away on this remote Pacific Island

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:01:59,900
Pacific Island

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Living on the edge of existence...

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OK, Vic, go now, go now. Right, that's it.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
..until 47-year-old Vic...

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here we go, puppy dogs!

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
..led them to capture and kill...

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bullshit!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
..the island's number-one predator.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We've just caught a prehistoric animal!

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But despite their best efforts,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they've not been able to repeat the success.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Truck empty.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The onset of starvation looks upon us.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And feast has turned to famine.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, look, you can see Piers's heart beating through his chest.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Boys, there's no meat on you.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think we're going to run into some really hard times

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in the next couple of weeks, and we'll see.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It'll test everybody's mettle, mine as much as anybody else.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Guys, there's a snake here.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Keep track of it, we're coming.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
OK, Bonnie.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Knock it off.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, my gosh.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Bonnie, you've become a killer.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's food, but I take no pleasure from doing that whatsoever.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's the second bloody animal I've ever headed since being here.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Killer.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In the four days since the men caught and ate the crocodile,

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
they've had to survive on slim pickings.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, hello.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's eaten... It's a little bird or something.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
..a baby bird!

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Look at that.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh!

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A bird and a snake.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Get him on the fire too.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, man.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's been there.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's like snake crisps.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's very, like, pork-scratching.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, man, guilt.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Apart from the odd, opportunistic kill,

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the only man who's been able to provide anything

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
like a regular supply of food for the group is 47-year-old Vic.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Woo!

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hoo!

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at the size of that bitch!

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Woo!

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If I didn't have another mouse to feed, I would live like a king.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's no two ways about that.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a shame nobody else is raking food in,

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
cos that would be helpful.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If he wants to go out and catch amazing fish

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and keeps me fed every night, I'm not going to stop the guy.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But even with Vic's contributions,

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the men are burning far more calories than they're consuming.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm slowly evaporating.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Soon to disappear down the plughole.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What happens in these periods of starvation

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
is that the body starts to eat into its own fat reserves

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and key muscle groups, like your legs,

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that you desperately need in a survival situation.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then, over time, as the brain also gets starved of nutrients,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that decline becomes mental as well as physical,

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and that then affects your ability to make smart,

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
rational decisions.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, that's new, that's fresh.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is dry as a bone, this stuff.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We got it? Got it.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Got it.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Every day, the men face a round of essential back-breaking chores.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I feel pretty tired.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Which leave them little time or energy for hunting.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
With no food to sustain them,

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the group's cook, Sam Brown,

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is doing his best to feed the fish.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's doing his best to rustle up an edible lunch

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
from leftover fish bits, crocodile bones and limpets.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Put the stew on, we're boiling the bones down,

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we're going to save the big bones so we can make a stock.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm trying to feed 11 people in the next hour or two hours.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lot of the cooking has fallen on my shoulders.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'd rather do it and do it well

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
than watch someone else it up and go hungry

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
or I have to pick fish scales out of my food.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, for f***'s sake, guys.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
F***ing filled with limpet guts.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We've got 11 bowls, three of which have been used as spittoons.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's overnight rotting limpet guts.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's disgusting and that's going to give us diarrhea,

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
vomiting, that's going to get you off the island really fast.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Somebody needs to be on washing up detail.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We'll wash all them? Yeah.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They don't wash themselves, boys.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think what you just said, they're a little bit unfair there, Sam.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll talk to them when we get back. No, no, why didn't you do it?

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do what? Why didn't you take them down and wash them?

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Cos I'm washing the fire and I'm cooking the soup.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's not a massive, hard task, though, is it?

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, if that soup pot falls over... We're all staffed.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're all f***ed. It's not a physically hard task, though, is it?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's all I'm going at. It's not a physically hard task.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Some of us are really working really hard.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We're all sweating our balls off.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We are. OK, mate, cook a pot of soup and we'll talk.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's all I'm saying.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There are one or two people that are fantastic at

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
avoiding what they're meant to do

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and looking busy doing very little.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I kind of think, like, if a tree falls in the forest

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and Vic's not there to hear it, it doesn't count.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like, only work that he does

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
or work that people do right next to him counts.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
F*** that shit.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The men on the island, they're spending every waking hour

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
in each other's company,

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and they get no respite from the intensity of that soup.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And in many ways, it's little surprise

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that they're starting to turn on each other.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
OK.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This should be good.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
After a morning of hard labour,

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the hungry men sit down, hoping to enjoy Sam's soup.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
God, it smells funky, doesn't it?

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Smells like crap.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There is some distinct smell of poo about this.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it? Yeah.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I just couldn't swallow it.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I literally couldn't swallow it.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It almost made me puke.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
After a barely edible lunch,

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Vic is determined to have a decent dinner.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I might fish.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What choice do I have?

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't want to eat limpets again, they're crap.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll eat them, but they're crap.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Flagging after their morning chores,

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the rest of the men decide to stay behind and camp.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everything's an effort.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's how I feel right now.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Knackered, boys.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Absolutely knackered.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Completely knackered.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Nobody asks me to go fishing,

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but they know I'll go fishing to get food.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I know they're doing the daily chores,

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
but guys just aren't going that extra yard.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come on, boys.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Once you've finished your duties or you don't have much of a duty,

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that ain't end of the day, is it?

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I am prejudiced against everybody that isn't me,

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
because if you all did it my way, it'd be a much better place.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I provide for my family.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm a good father.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm a good husband.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm a good husband, I hope.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I hope I'm an excellent lover.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to cope without speaking to my wife and kids

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
for that length of time.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've no idea.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I really don't know.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No idea.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Gives me goosebumps.

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Not sure.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Dude, you are an absolute fish-tickling bastard, aren't you?

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Late afternoon.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you want a hamburger?

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
After four hours of fishing,

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Vic has single-handedly provided dinner for the rest of the men.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That is so hard.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm fucked.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Nobody been and got any coconut, no?

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's getting harder and harder every day,

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
coming back and seeing everybody laid on fucking beach

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and I'm catching fish.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, I'm all right.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't need to sit down.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I need coconut.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I need water.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Coconuts we're getting tomorrow.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fucking hell.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I thought we were going out for coconut or something.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How difficult would it be for two or three lads to go across

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and get a bag full of coconuts?

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Do you want me to do that as well?

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you want me to do that as well?

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Fed up of the group taking him for granted,

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Vic's made a big decision.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Bollocks to it.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not fishing any more.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Somebody else go fishing.

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I might have a couple of days off.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
See how everybody fares then.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If somebody else has turned to step up to the plate.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wowzers.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You've done incredibly well, Vic.

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, you really have, mate.

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You've done it absolutely brilliantly.

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You absolutely nailed it.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thanks so much.

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have a couple of things to say,

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and I'm unsure whether to say them now,

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
cos I don't want to spoil the atmosphere,

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
or save them till the end of the night.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, do I do them now?

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Say them now.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Say them now?

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's have them now.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
OK.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Today, I spent fishing all day on my own.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But we're all sat round here,

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
happy as pigs in shit, eating, though, now,

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and I went without a buddy.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Perhaps you shouldn't have gone without a buddy.

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But if I hadn't have gone when I went,

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
we wouldn't all be eating.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I certainly don't want to be busting a gut

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and come back to see people kipping, pampering,

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
tossing it off, doing whatever.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not fair. It's not fair.

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's top and bottom of it.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not fair.

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a very good point, Vic.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It is.

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I'm glad you've raised it.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, I'll put my rods down,

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
you'll fish for your own snap,

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I'll eat limpets like restiers.

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The group's most skilled hunter

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
has gone on fishing strike.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's it?

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Fish out.

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
OK?

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, that's fair.

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Understood.

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The burden of finding food

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
will now fall on the rest of the men.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We are knackered.

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We are screwed.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We have relied solely on fish,

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
rod catching,

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
most of them from Vic.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But tomorrow, I'm a bit worried,

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
cos I'm not sure the guys are going to cope.

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It scares me.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think everyone's feeling a little bit sluggish today,

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
aren't they?

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
7am.

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Dan and Sam Brown are on the early morning water run.

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How are you feeling after your little debate yesterday?

280
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, with Vic?

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Pretty good?

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think Vic was just maybe

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
trying to pick a bit of a fight yesterday.

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He likes to push buttons.

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think he likes to niggle.

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He likes a little...

289
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know, he sort of...

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He has this sort of, like,

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
oh, I'm nice as pie, da-da-da.

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Fuck off, he is.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where's my hat?

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Last night, 47-year-old Vic,

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the group's most successful hunter,

297
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
announced that he was going on fishing strike.

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm absolutely knackered.

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Are you?

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just trudging out, catching fish and trudging back

302
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
day after day after day after day after day.

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not fair.

304
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How many fishing lines have you hooked up before, Phil?

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
None.

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The burden of finding a fish supper

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
now lies with the other men.

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There is no reserve.

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There's no larder that we have here at the moment.

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So if we don't catch anything today, we don't eat.

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Right, so where are the points to go fishing?

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Although refusing to fish himself,

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Vic doesn't want to go hungry,

315
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so he offers the men some advice.

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get your fish.

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So he offers the men some advice.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Get your hook and push it through the limb pit at the top.

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OK.

320
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then turn the limb pit and come back through the soft gel.

321
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Feel, feel, feel.

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Boom.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But if hidden on it, I would say just hidden

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and right on the edge.

325
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Cos they nibble on the edge

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and they want them to just nibble it and get caught.

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You undermine me every time when I start telling about stuff

329
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and it's rude.

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Please don't do it.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sorry, Vic.

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
OK?

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I thought I was adding to you.

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So if you put two limb pits on...

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He was very quick to swipe at me

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and I think maybe Vic has lost perspective a little bit.

338
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He thinks that he's the kingpin

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and that he is providing more than anyone else

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and doing more than everyone else.

341
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know if he feels he needs to contribute,

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
so if we all think he's contributed or...

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't know, but it's rude.

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He shouldn't do it.

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm thinking three, maybe four bottles around each pole

346
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and then just like that all the way along.

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We are going to adapt and overcome.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
36-year-old Will has come up with an ambitious plan

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to fish the deeper waters surrounding the island.

350
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We've got to make a raft

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
so we can get in the middle of the channel,

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
massive hook, big fish bait.

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I would love to have a tuna.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That would be the best day ever.

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Imagine that.

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sashimi.

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We don't have any oil drums or anything.

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What we've got on this island

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
is shedloads of empty plastic bottles.

360
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Fingers crossed she'll float.

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Right.

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's get cracking.

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
While he waits for the men to find him food,

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Vic takes the opportunity

365
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to make a bed for himself.

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So unlike the others,

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
he'll be protected from critters on the jungle floor.

368
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Look at that natural twine.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What an absolute biscuit.

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, I'm happy with this so far.

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't have a double bed, I'm afraid,

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
so I can't interest my wife in sleeping with me this evening.

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I'm just going to single it up.

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Having isolated himself from the other men,

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Vic's thoughts are increasingly turning to family.

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I had a very unnerving dream last night about home,

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
which was very horrible.

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It woke me up in not such a pleasant mood.

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm missing home desperately.

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I keep thinking more and more about my wife and kids every day.

381
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I could do with a kiss and a cuddle off my missus,

382
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
squeeze the life out of a blesser.

383
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's time to get to work.

384
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
I'm

385
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
ready to go.

386
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Will's raft is ready to set sail.

387
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I came up with the idea,

388
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I shall name this raft

389
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
after my two gorgeous daughters, Freya and Pippa.

390
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Shall we call it Fripster?

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Nice, mate.

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll get it, guys.

393
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,480
It looks like a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks,

394
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,680
because it is a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks.

395
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,920
But our livelihood and our dependency on food relies on it.

396
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
So go on, Fripster.

397
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,840
Fingers crossed we're in orbit launch.

398
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,760
Get some fish.

399
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,440
I name this boat Fripster the First.

400
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,800
Long may she catch us fish from the deep.

401
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,680
Right, on we get.

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,240
Are you ready?

403
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,720
You're sailing the Fripster Road.

404
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,800
Come on, lads.

405
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
See you in two weeks.

406
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,040
Bye.

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,200
She floats!

408
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
She floats!

409
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,120
I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivor's arsenal

410
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
is resourcefulness, being able to look at an everyday object

411
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,760
and think of clever, ingenious ways of using it to help you.

412
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
The risks are big,

413
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,600
but the spoils could be even bigger if that raft succeeds.

414
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
Bigger strokes, mate.

415
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,280
Reach.

416
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,920
After a huge joint effort from all the men,

417
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,200
apart from Vic, the raft appears to be a success.

418
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,280
Most of the group are now out trying to catch supper.

419
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,800
I've not got the patience for fishing, I tell you that for nothing.

420
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Leaving the gruelling job of firewood to Vic, an IT consultant,

421
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
Kyle.

422
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,120
Kyle, why do we need a shitload more kindling today than we have done?

423
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,440
It's not heavy stuff, is it?

424
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,440
Yeah.

425
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,240
Kyle's still quite gifted at doing very little.

426
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,800
But that's the problem with intelligent people,

427
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
because they think they're cleverer than the people

428
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,160
that they're out doing the job for.

429
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,080
They think they can out-think them.

430
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
When it comes to manual labour, Jesus Christ, lads,

431
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
stop getting all crazy.

432
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,760
It's manual labour, which is every job we've got.

433
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,640
I think on this island there will be people that come off,

434
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,800
physically bollocks, regardless of diet, whether we eat or we don't eat,

435
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
and there'll be guys come off who aren't.

436
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,240
And if we're not all hanging out of our arse at the end of this,

437
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,240
somebody hasn't been working hard enough, have they?

438
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
Would you agree with that?

439
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
No, it could happen where we're not all spent.

440
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,160
We work hard as a team, we achieve a lot,

441
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,440
and at the end, we're not all sort of hanging out of our arses.

442
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
That could happen. What the fuck are you talking about?

443
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm talking English. I'm just talking English.

444
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm uneducated, you have to lower it down to my level.

445
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,120
What, didn't you understand? The term we use in Yorkshire,

446
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
layman's terms, every job is a manual job.

447
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Do we agree? Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,320
So, if we all plough into that 100% manually,

449
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,480
we will all be bollocksed at the end of this journey.

450
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,720
I've already said I don't think at the end of this...

451
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
Right, then, let me just say it again, then.

452
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,720
All it goes on about is this is a physical place,

453
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
every task in here is physical.

454
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,120
Whoop-de-doo. You know, that's brilliant,

455
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,680
but we're not all just grunts that have been sent out here

456
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,120
to bash on bits of wood.

457
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,960
You can talk your way around whatever you want,

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
top and bottom of it is, it's a physical island,

459
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,200
every job is physical, we should all be bollocksed.

460
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,320
If not, somebody's carrying somebody else.

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,280
That's the top and bottom of it.

462
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,760
Mid-afternoon.

463
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,760
Still reeling from yesterday's argument

464
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,240
with Vic, Sam Brown is trying to catch some dinner.

465
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,200
Vic keeps making little remarks to me that just make me seethe.

466
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,000
So, what was getting his goat this morning?

467
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,880
Oh, mate, a whole load of things.

468
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
If we can catch some fish...

469
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,000
Hopefully, Vic will be in a slightly better mood.

470
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,640
After three hours on the water,

471
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,280
Barney and Sam haven't had a single bite.

472
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
So, what are you thinking with this rod?

473
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm thinking, I don't know,

474
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,640
maybe they always...

475
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,960
They always say, patience is a virtue, don't they?

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,080
And I'm quite impatient.

477
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,520
Is that line tight?

478
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,920
No.

479
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,040
No, no bite.

480
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Oh, fuck it, let's go in.

481
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,960
With nightfall approaching, the other men also return to camp.

482
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,200
Vic is waiting to see how many fish they have caught

483
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
in his absence.

484
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
No joy, fella?

485
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,600
No, I had a nice day fishing, as you'd say, Vic.

486
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,960
Not catching.

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
Old dogs should learn new tricks.

488
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,360
Listen when I tell him.

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,080
Did you not listen?

490
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
No.

491
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,600
Four hours fishing and one poxy trigger.

492
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I fucking hate fishing.

493
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,080
It's exhausting just standing there in the sun

494
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,040
for X amount of hours.

495
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,520
Charlie caught a fish.

496
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,320
Well, that ain't feeding nobody, is it?

497
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
That ain't feeding Jack shit.

498
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
It's just limpets again.

499
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
The men's attempts to provide dinner without Vic's help

500
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
have been a miserable failure.

501
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,720
Desperation corner over here.

502
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,840
Mm-hm.

503
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
The pressure is on me to feed everybody.

504
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,040
It's almost as though I am expected to grab a rod

505
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,200
and go out and catch fish so everybody else can eat.

506
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
And that ain't good. I don't like that.

507
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,040
See you in the morning, ladies.

508
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,480
With no food in camp, Vic opts for an early night in his new bed.

509
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
You on the beach, sir?

510
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh, dear.

511
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
Oh, yeah.

512
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,400
Let me get myself ready for bed.

513
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,480
Oh, dear.

514
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,400
Oh, dear.

515
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,320
Oh, dear, God, yeah, that's lovely.

516
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
That is...

517
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
He has to remember that we are a team here

518
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,360
and with certain things, he is quite selfish.

519
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,120
Does not get any better, does it?

520
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,600
For a family man, I might have expected him to be

521
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,680
more considerate of others.

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,840

Mm, yeah, that was a good night's sleep.

535
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,680
I had some lovely dreams.

536
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,800
For some reason, one of us knew Jonathan Ross

537
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,160
and we ended up in his house,

538
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,320
trying to catch his fish out of his fish tank.

539
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Can't think why.

540
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,440
Oh!

541
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, I love my bed.

542
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,960
Protected from the jungle critters,

543
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,040
Vic has had his best sleep yet.

544
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
WHISTLE BLOWS

545
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,440
While the others have had their worst.

546
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,880
Oh, my legs are a bit into shit, my arms are a bit into shit.

547
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Sleeping rough on the jungle floor,

548
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,960
the men have been attacked overnight by a swarm of sandflies.

549
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,640
They're everywhere, covered in them.

550
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,680
They must have, you know, 500 bites or so.

551
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,040
I'm just not having a good reaction to them.

552
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,040
And they're starting to swell up.

553
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
You may think on a desert island,

554
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,680
your real enemies are the crocs, the scorpions, the snakes,

555
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,080
but actually it's often the little things you can't see.

556
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
And worse of these are sandflies.

557
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,120
They're super itchy, ten times worse than a mosquito.

558
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,760
You scratch away, it's hot, it's humid,

559
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,400
and that's when the bites can become infected.

560
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,760
They have had a monster.

561
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
It's a massive gore.

562
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Oh!

563
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Oh!

564
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,600
This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in

565
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
or eat you alive.

566
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,880
Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.

567
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
Reeling from last night's infestation,

568
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,880
the men call an emergency meeting.

569
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
I've got to put my hands up and say my insulated bones are so bad,

570
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
I can barely walk.

571
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,960
I can't even walk, I can't even go in the sun.

572
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,960
So I'm happy to chop wood and stuff in here,

573
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,960
but if I go in the sun, my legs just flare up

574
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
and I can't even move them.

575
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Tomorrow I might be down, but today is absolutely excruciating.

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,960
It's like someone's puffing fire into my calves when I move them.

577
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
My worry with these bites,

578
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,960
cos they just seem to be, like, escalating a notch,

579
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
like, that's...

580
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,960
I worry that, what with all the rain,

581
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,760
some other kind of bug might come up,

582
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,000
a bug might have hatched and might be starting to feast on us.

583
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,800
Today, priorities.

584
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,240
I think we just concentrate on just trying to get

585
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,080
as many of these beds up as possible.

586
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Raised beds are the group's best protection against further attacks.

587
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Right, are you ready? Cos this one might jump.

588
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,720
Having built his own yesterday,

589
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,320
Vic temporarily ends his work to rule to lend a helping hand.

590
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,640
I think all of us, there's a full team of 11,

591
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,600
get stuck into beds, everybody's bed.

592
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,600
Come on, give it some.

593
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,600
Come on, it ticked!

594
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,600
I might be quite pushy with it, so we really get stuck into it.

595
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,600
Scamp on it, fella.

596
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,600
All 11 stone here.

597
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,600
Bingo!

598
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,600
Whoo! That's what a bit of graft does for you, boys!

599
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
Whoo!

600
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,600
Right, my furor, what do you think?

601
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
Perfect.

602
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,520
With all available hands,

603
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,480
with hands on beds and nobody hunting or fishing,

604
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
cameraman Sam Brown has once again spent the morning

605
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,480
trying to conjure up something for lunch.

606
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
I feel a little bit like this child catcher this morning.

607
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,480
We're going to boil them all to death and then eat them with soup.

608
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,480
Shush, my pretties, it's nearly over.

609
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,480
I think the only job I haven't done so far on this tour

610
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,480
is the difficult task of cooking.

611
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,480
Mmm, cooking.

612
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,440
Right, Sam, there's guys up there busting their knackers.

613
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,440
I don't know how many blisters.

614
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm going to help the lads with wood, that's all.

615
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,440
I've just been up to help the lads with wood

616
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,440
and there's no more for me to carry down.

617
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,440
Let's chop some down, then.

618
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,440
If he keeps going like that, you know, I'll react.

619
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,440
You know, I know I will.

620
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,440
It's good for us to vent. Fucking hell.

621
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
Shit!

622
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,440
It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.

623
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,400
You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!

624
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,400
Makes us all feel much better.

625
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,400
They're chopping wood, they're not busting your guts.

626
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,400
I can't help them chop more because I don't have a fucking machete.

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,400
He's only got three and a half.

628
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,400
A leaderless group fighting to stay alive

629
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,400
is always going to face conflict.

630
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,400
And what happens is individuals tend to push their own agendas

631
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,400
and that, in turn, takes away valuable time and valuable energy

632
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,400
for the things that really matter.

633
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
How's the soup looking, Sam?

634
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,400
Really good, mate. Really, really good.

635
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,400
Your three-and-a-half-hour making soup could be done in 25 minutes.

636
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,400
You want to...? Really?

637
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
How difficult can stirring soup be?

638
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,400
To some, it would look like you didn't want to go do the harder job.

639
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,400
Excuse me?

640
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,400
Some would say it's because you didn't want to go bust a gut.

641
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,400
I would say, fuck you to that person. That's what I'd say.

642
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,400
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

643
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,400
Shall we just calm it down a bit?

644
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,400
We're here for another, what, three or four weeks?

645
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,400
Just let's fucking calm down, eh?

646
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,360
There's no need to be like this.

647
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,360
So you're saying I'm avoiding graft, Vic? Is that what you're saying?

648
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,360
Are you?

649
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,360
That sounded very much like you were just a second ago.

650
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,360
You're answering the question with the question, are you?

651
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,360
What? Are you?

652
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,360
What? Am I avoiding graft? Yeah.

653
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,360
I fucking don't think so, man.

654
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,360
Then why are you biting, then? What?

655
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,360
Cos you've been niggling for weeks.

656
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,360
Have I?

657
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,360
This is what it boils down to for me, Vic.

658
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,360
You act like certain jobs are like macho jobs,

659
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,360
fishing, chopping wood, everything else,

660
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
women's work.

661
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,320
That's the feeling I get, right?

662
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,320
And if that's cooking, that's fucking carrying water,

663
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,320
whatever it is, in your head, it's like,

664
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
this is graft, this is good, everything else, not difficult.

665
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,320
I think feeding everybody is one of the most important jobs on this island.

666
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,320
So do I.

667
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,320
Every job is a manual job.

668
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,320
Some jobs, boom, they're done. 25 minutes, they're done.

669
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,320
And every three quarts of an hour, you steer it.

670
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,320
Is that right?

671
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,320
What I'm trying to do, Vic, is get as many good meals out of this as I can, right?

672
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,320
Rather than just use it once and throw it away.

673
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,280
You don't need it.

674
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah.

675
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,280
So maybe just keep your comments to yourself if you don't know about it, huh?

676
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,280
I thought we were allowed to hear his comments.

677
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,280
Yeah, well, it's great, but if you want to fucking, like,

678
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,280
if you want to piss me off, you're going about it the right way.

679
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,280
Some jobs are physically easy, some jobs aren't.

680
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,280
Is that a better way to put it?

681
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,280
You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy

682
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,280
and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.

683
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
We have a warning for you, mate.

684
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,320
Oh, baby!

685
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,280
We look absolutely furious.

686
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,280
If a mate said that to me, I'd fucking hit them, you know?

687
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,280
If someone at work said that, we'd have trouble, you know?

688
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,280
Fucking butt. I'd just... I'd take...

689
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,560
There's no good way to take that, right?

690
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,920
I take that as, like, a stab at my integrity.

691
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,360
Fuck it, man.

692
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,880
I look forward to sitting down in some 25-minute soup at some stage.

693
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
We have built the honeymoon suite.

694
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,520
It is strong enough for the rampy-pampy, you'll see, yeah.

695
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,960
4pm.

696
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,040
After a day of hard graft, the beds are finished.

697
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,320
Welcome to the chateau.

698
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,760
Let's open the curtain.

699
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,320
And that there is the most uncomfortable beds

700
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,000
anyone will ever sleep on.

701
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,320
Oh!

702
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,800
This is where the magic happens.

703
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
It's not too bad, actually.

704
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
I will say one thing. What?

705
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,760
Right above your head, a lot of daylight.

706
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
That, Piers, is my skylight.

707
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,040
The men will now have better protection from the jungle critters.

708
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,240
But the day of hard physical labour has left them hungry and shattered.

709
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,360
I am running on empty.

710
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,760
I feel like I'm lugging my body about.

711
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,640
I can't even stand up straight.

712
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm starting to sweat.

713
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm starting to sway, so I can just slurp my words a bit.

714
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,600
Since Vic went on fishing strike,

715
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,040
the men have survived on Sam's leftover soup and slithers of coconut.

716
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
And Vic isn't impressed.

717
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,560
If I eat any more of this shit, I'm going to puke.

718
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
It's horrible.

719
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,480
Coconut.

720
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,200
Yay!

721
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,400
That's your shit sort of iron needle.

722
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,320
Mother Nature, you can be a cruel, cruel mistress.

723
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,480
Do you know that?

724
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,600
She's not going to beat me.

725
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,720
There's nothing going to beat me.

726
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,200
Fucking hellfire.

727
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
Disgusting.

728
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,960
Ah, screw it. That's it. I've had enough.

729
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,800
Come on, Victor, let's have some fish.

730
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,840
Despite Vic's strike, he's determined to catch a decent fish supper

731
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,520
and persuades Kyle to join him on the raft.

732
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,080
Instead of catching little fish, I want to be catching some that are bigger.

733
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,400
What's getting out of you?

734
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,400
With my health and safety hat on, I'd be more worried that we've got a homemade raft

735
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,400
in some very strong currents in a very deep piece of water.

736
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Vic and Kyle are already 200 yards from shore.

737
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,880
Should something happen, they're dangerously out of their depth.

738
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh, this is something, Vic.

739
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,080
Ooh.

740
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,560
Has Daddy got a tug?

741
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Oh!

742
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Do you have a tug?

743
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,840
Oh!

744
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,160
I think Daddy might have a tug, pal.

745
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,120
Get on the end of that, kid.

746
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,640
Feel the end of that.

747
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,400
I'm not sure what it is.

748
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,240
What the fuck is that?

749
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I don't know.

750
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,240
I don't know.

751
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
What's that?

752
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,320
What the effing hell is that?

753
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,080
We've got ourselves a fucking eel, kid!

754
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
You, sir, are going fucking nowhere.

755
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Can you hold that for me?

756
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Yeah, of course.

757
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Thank you.

758
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,200
Right, now I've pinned him.

759
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,680
Pinned him down to the side.

760
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Good man.

761
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,280
I now need to club him with something, and I think that might be this.

762
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
Have I got plenty of space?

763
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
Oh, yes.

764
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
Yeah, I do believe that's him.

765
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,840
As we speak now.

766
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,440
Right, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

767
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,440
Oh, you fucker, yeah.

768
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
I don't like this fucking fighting bat bollocks at all.

769
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I really don't.

770
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,080
They're 200, 300, 400 yards out now.

771
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
And still going.

772
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,280
One of the most precious resources that the men actually have

773
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,240
is their own energy.

774
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,200
Yeah.

775
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,920
They're living hand-to-mouth, struggling for every mouthful of food.

776
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,920
The temptation is to go to greater and greater lengths

777
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,360
to get that precious energy.

778
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Right, that's it.

779
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,000
I can now tie you up.

780
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,440
Safely.

781
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,680
But here's the danger.

782
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
The more malnourished the men get,

783
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,440
the more their judgement gets impaired.

784
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,960
That's when the small mistakes become full-blown emergencies,

785
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,920
and that can happen in the blink of an eye.

786
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
Two of those, pretty nice bat.

787
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,000
Come on.

788
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
That's one hell of a tide, isn't it?

789
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,200
They're getting carried.

790
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,720
We are going backwards.

791
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,520
Right, go on, paddle, paddle, paddle. Don't stop.

792
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,280
Vic and Kyle are attempting to paddle back to the beach.

793
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,640
I don't like this, mate.

794
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,800
No, neither do I.

795
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,480
Start paddling now!

796
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,800
But they've been caught by a powerful undercurrent.

797
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,360
Paddle.

798
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,840
Paddle, guys!

799
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Come on!

800
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,920
You all right?

801
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,600
I think the current's got them.

802
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,200
Come on!

803
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,400
Come on, let's go.

804
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,560
Fucking hell.

805
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,600
Come on!

806
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,120
Come on, boy!

807
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Yeah!

808
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,480
We're going to crash, though!

809
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
Come on!

810
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
At the mercy of the current,

811
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,240
the raft is on a collision course with the island's treacherous rocky coastline,

812
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
which could tear the men to shreds.

813
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,680
Come on, Kyle, dig the fucker in.

814
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Paddle, paddle!

815
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,080
And turn again, you know.

816
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,600
Oh, baby.

817
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,840
It'll... Right, paddle, paddle!

818
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Paddle!

819
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,320
Don't stop, don't stop.

820
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,920
No!

821
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,000
Everybody safe? Everybody OK? No injuries?

822
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,320
Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord for that.

823
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,320
After surviving a near-death experience,

824
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,320
the men are shaken, but physically unscathed.

825
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
It all got mangled up and chaffed up.

826
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,840
Their raft, though, is destroyed.

827
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
That must have been fucking scary, man.

828
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,240
Yeah, it was.

829
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
We were getting smashed on the rocks and everything,

830
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,440
so I do appreciate that.

831
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,880
Sam and Dan's swift actions saved Vic and Kyle from annihilation on the rocks.

832
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,960
It was fucking hairy, mate.

833
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,840
Like, that was... I think that was the closest I've been to coughing on this trip.

834
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,480
Thanks for coming and helping us, guys.

835
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,200
Let's get back to camp before dark.

836
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Yeah, yeah.

837
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,640
First light tomorrow, we'll try and salvage as much of this as we can.

838
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,320
With their raft in tatters and Vic's eel lost to the ocean,

839
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,240
the men now face a second night with empty stomachs.

840
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,920
Where the hell's the rest of the raft?

841
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, shit, is that the raft?

842
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,560
The tripster is no longer, boys.

843
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Yes.

844
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,600
Vic's got a brave face, hasn't he?

845
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,120
But he's really shook up.

846
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,040
He could have just been knocked unconscious,

847
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,120
brain splattered out in a rock.

848
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
He could have died.

849
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,200
Like, actually, he could have died.

850
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,960
Vic's near-death experience isn't the only thing on his mind.

851
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,320
It's been a little bit quite difficult today, truth's known, for me.

852
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,000
It's come up to fifth, which is the date of my first date with my missus.

853
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I'm missing her immensely.

854
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,840
So, tomorrow, I may spend lots and lots of time

855
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,400
contemplating my missus and all that sort of thing.

856
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Morning.

857
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,240
Oh, that was a good sleep.

858
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,680
Oh, morning.

859
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm so happy.

860
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm so happy.

861
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,120
Good morning.

862
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,200
After a savage sandfly attack 24 hours ago,

863
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,080
the men have spent their first night

864
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,120
raised off the ground in their own beds.

865
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,240
Good morning.

866
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,960
Oh, last night was wonderful.

867
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Last night was the best unbroken sleep I've had by a mile.

868
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,240
This time, it's Vic who hasn't slept a wink.

869
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,400
Vic looks like he spent the entire night sitting on a fence post.

870
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,840
The poor bugger looks absolutely drained.

871
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,960
He's got a lot of strain today.

872
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,800
He's got a lot of strain today.

873
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
He's got a lot of strain today.

874
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,440
Victor looks a little bit edgy today.

875
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,680
I can see him cracking a little bit.

876
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,000
Hopefully, he's all right.

877
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,560
You know, he's not the kind of guy who would show his emotions.

878
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,920
He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.

879
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,720
He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.

880
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,800
Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.

881
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,920
Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.

882
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Never again.

883
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,640
Never again.

884
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,840
Never again.

885
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,240
Never in this long.

886
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,160
The greatest thing that ever happened to me,

887
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,560
other than being born, was my wife.

888
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,520
I can't wait to get back to Cheryl.

889
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,320
Smell her, taste her, touch her, feel her.

890
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,520
All them things.

891
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,840
I love that woman so much.

892
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,200
It's immense.

893
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
Truly immense.

894
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,400
As human beings, when we're stripped of everything,

895
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,360
the real essence of who we are is laid bare.

896
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,740
Every single one of them

897
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
It is just a nature of survival.

898
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
It's a nature of enduring hardship.

899
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,740
If you can take a long, hard look at yourself

900
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
when you're at your lowest ebb,

901
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,740
and in that moment you can accept what you see,

902
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,740
in my eye, that's what makes you a true survivor.

903
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,740
Devastated. Absolutely devastated.

904
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,740
This is literally what we were getting smashed against yesterday.

905
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
It's so dangerous.

906
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah.

907
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Oh, I feel so dreadful at the moment. It's unbelievable.

908
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,740
This beautiful, dangerous paradise can be a killer.

909
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,740
You take your eye off the ball and she's going to bite you in the arse.

910
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,740
The raft crash will stay with me till the day I die.

911
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
These guys saved my life.

912
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,740
In camp, Vic calls the men together for a chat.

913
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,740
I'd just like to say if I ever offended anybody, upset them,

914
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,740
unduly, and it weren't deserved, then I apologise.

915
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
It won't happen again.

916
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,740
I worry immensely about providing for me and mine,

917
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,740
so perhaps that's why I compensate for working so physically hard,

918
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,740
like a fool, like a donkey.

919
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
I've got a fantastic wife and kids,

920
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,740
but I have this overwhelming urge to provide.

921
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,740
It drives me more than anything else,

922
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,740
and the fear of not being able to do that is terrifying.

923
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Terrifying.

924
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,740
Vic, the man that said a few weeks ago,

925
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,740
erm, he does not see the point in crying...

926
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
..cried.

927
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,740
The way that you describe your wife and your family

928
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,740
I find inspirational.

929
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,740
I've never known a man to come away with a group of guys

930
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,740
and to say, I love my wife to bits.

931
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,740
She's the best thing I've ever experienced in my life.

932
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,740
I never hear that.

933
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
And that's one thing I'm going to take away from you.

934
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm going to take that.

935
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,740
Every time you talk about Cheryl, like, I feel like she's in the room.

936
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,740
Don't get me wrong, Vic, you've pissed me off

937
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
more than just about anyone here.

938
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,740
But overall, mate, you're worth every ounce of you.

939
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,740
You've lifted us up more times than I can say.

940
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,740
We'd be seriously worse off if you weren't here.

941
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,740
I weren't expecting this. I won't be honest.

942
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Not at all.

943
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,740
I expected difficulties and hungers and confrontation and conflict,

944
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,740
but not to find something out about me.

945
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
That was the last thing I expected.

946
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,740
What a great bunch of blokes these really are.

947
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,740
What a great bunch of blokes.

948
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,740
I ain't never going to see eye to eye with them all,

949
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
but on this island, it's a family.

950
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,740
It's the island family.

951
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,740
It's the island family.

952
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,740
Vic calls an end to his fishing strike

953
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,740
and heads out on his own to catch dinner for the group.

954
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Nice and steady. Nice and fucking steady.

955
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Hold your ground.

956
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
We're good. We're good. We're good.

957
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,740
It's been three days since the men had anything substantial to eat

958
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,740
and they are obsessing about food.

959
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
There was this documentary about some women

960
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,740
that were still breastfeeding kids at the age of, was it three, four?

961
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,740
I always think that the longer you're on the breast, the better.

962
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,740
What, eight, nine? Yeah.

963
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I think if you're taken off the breast too early...

964
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,740
You become short. ..it stunts your growth.

965
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
Well, hello!

966
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Gentlemen. Yes, Vic.

967
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,740
How are we all? What did you get, Vic?

968
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,740
I wish I had a fish for each of us, but alas, I don't.

969
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,740
Oh.

970
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,740
What I can say, though, is this.

971
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,740
Of the five fish I've caught...

972
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,740
Hello! Hello!

973
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,740
..two are the biggest I have ever caught in all my life.

974
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,740
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

975
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,740
And one of them is the size of a small dog.

976
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,740
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

977
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
Yeah, boy!

978
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,740
Daddy brought home the bacon.

979
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
Yeah! Yeah!

980
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
They are massive, Vickers!

981
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

982
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

983
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

984
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
And so say all of us!

985
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,740
He's back to normal Vic fellows.

986
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,740
Woo!

987
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
Shouting and whooping and getting fish and stuff like that,

988
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,740
everything that he loves.

989
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
Look at the size of that, bitch.

990
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,740
Oh!

991
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
Fripster will sail again.

992
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,740
Fripster 2 will sail again.

993
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
I can't get the Titanic theme tune in my head.

994
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
That was like Titanic.

995
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
See, if I was Kate Winslet, who was Leonardo?

996
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,740
LAUGHTER

997
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,740
Oh, it's small.

998
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Sometimes I like to smash him repeatedly in the face,

999
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,740
but I think me and Vic were in danger of becoming quite good friends.

1000
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
Huge respect for the guy.

1001
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,740
Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick!

1002
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,740
Woo!

1003
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,740
When in doubt, send Vic out!

1004
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Yeah!

1005
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,740
Next time on The Women's Island...

1006
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,740
You are not leaving this island.

1007
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,740
I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back.

1008
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,740
The one thing we need for George is food.

1009
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,740
Get the knife! Get the knife!

1010
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,740
Come here, come here, come here!

1011
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,740
I think it's about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal.

1012
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
There, there, there, there, there.

1013
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,740
Go.

1014
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,740
HE GRUNTS

1015
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
