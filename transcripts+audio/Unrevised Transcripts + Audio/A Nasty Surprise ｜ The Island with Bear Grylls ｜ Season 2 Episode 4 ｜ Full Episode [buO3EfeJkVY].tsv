14640	22640	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll
22640	29640	be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming

89640	107100	four days ago 14 British women were cast away on this remote uninhabited Pacific Island
107100	114660	already one woman has left the island I need to go
114660	118980	who's up for this
119640	125280	some of the group stayed behind at the makeshift camp whilst an expedition party went in search of
125280	134160	a permanent base with a sustainable water source it's not salty but with no idea how to get back
134160	143700	to the others they are now lost in the thick of the jungle and are completely out of water
143700	147900	we have nothing to drink we don't know where we are
149640	155520	the women left behind have just rain water to drink their fire has gone out and panic is setting in
155520	165480	with both groups now starving and critically dehydrated their time on the island could be
165480	171360	over before it's really begun it's day four
173280	178800	the five women left in camp have been waiting for over 24 hours for the others to return from their
178800	179280	expedition
179640	190080	I feel dreadful honestly I feel absolutely dreadful I never thought I would be so desperate
190080	198240	for food and water we all want to get out of this camp but we know the other group are coming back
198240	204180	for us we can't set off because we'll lose them the women are trying to relight their fire to
204180	207900	purify water from a muddy puddle but their wood is damp
207900	209280	that's it
209640	214800	next it's moving oh every time what the hell are we doing there's actually just another
214800	221160	Groundhog Day of the same it's like the best camping ever isn't it the best camping
221160	228000	every time camping twice I don't like it

243940	248780	is positivity, positivity, positivity.
248780	253500	I might as well, honestly, I might as well have gone and sat in my horse's field for
253500	257660	five days and not eaten, but just sat in the muddiest part of the horse's field, but the
257660	260180	difference is I might have had a horse for company.
260180	268180	I don't actually mind, because I love extremes of weather. I like roaring wind and lightning
268180	270180	and torrential rain and...
270180	274940	Oh, lovely. I'm pleased for you. Seriously, I'm really chuffed for you.
274940	280460	I've always wanted an adventure, and I thank God I haven't done that much for myself over
280460	286060	the last 55 years. Should have done more. Should have seen more.
286060	290860	I get really wound up over the most stupid things. Like, you know when you buy expensive
290860	297860	toilet roll and then you tear it and it doesn't tear along the perforations? That really winds
298180	299180	me up.
299180	305620	I try to stop myself talking a lot, but I do like to think that other people can get
305620	309620	away with it in edgeways, you know what I mean?
309620	315220	This is day four now without any food, so we're really going to feel it today.
315220	321180	Earlier, the women found some yucca, a type of potato. Mother of two, Julie, has decided
321180	324860	to peel it, despite not having a fire to cook it on.
324860	328180	Oh, now, do you know what? I've just wasted that now.
328180	333180	But we could have boiled it in soup, that's what Beth was saying.
333180	336180	I would please leave the yucca.
336180	341180	If she goes on about those potatoes anymore, I'm going to stab her.
348180	355180	After 24 hours without a drink, the expedition party are dehydrated, hopelessly lost, and
355180	357180	wandering directionless.
358180	365180	Walking is painful now, physically and mentally.
365180	368180	I just hope we can find a drink.
368180	377180	I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.
377180	379180	Careful here, guys, it's really slippery.
379180	381180	Oh, shit.
381180	382180	Are you all right?
382180	383180	Super slippery.
383180	384180	Really slippery.
384180	385180	Oh, God.
385180	386180	Oh, .
386180	387180	Hey.
387180	388180	Who was that?
388180	389180	That was me.
389180	390180	Oh, my God, there's a caiman.
390180	391180	That is a big .
391180	392180	Oh, yes, I can see it.
392180	393180	Straight ahead.
393180	394180	Oh, shit.
394180	395180	Oh, my God, that's .
395180	396180	Yeah, it's enormous.
396180	397180	It's watching us, though.
397180	398180	We actually, I just can't, I literally must have walked past his nose by that much.
398180	399180	Didn't spot him.
399180	400180	Did we throw things at his hip?
400180	401180	No.
401180	402180	No.
402180	403180	Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size is the most likely
403180	404180	to die.
404180	405180	Oh, my God.
405180	406180	Oh, my God.
406180	407180	Oh, my God.
407180	408180	Oh, my God.
408180	409180	Oh, my God.
409180	410180	Oh, my God.
410180	411180	Oh, my God.
411180	412180	Oh, my God.
412180	413180	Oh, my God.
413180	414180	Oh, my God.
414180	419020	Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size could provide tens of thousands
419020	422180	of calories for the women who have barely eaten in days.
422180	423180	Billy Big Balls, that.
423180	424180	That is a serious Billy Big Ball.
424180	425180	I'm not going for that one for dinner, then.
425180	426180	Not tonight, not without a fire.
426180	427180	We wouldn't tackle that unless we don't have a sharp knife on us.
427180	428180	We'll be back for you, men.
428180	429180	Sleep with one eye open.
429180	441420	With hunger and dehydration sapping their energy and with hunting equipment left at camp,
441420	444180	the women decide to walk away from this potentially deadly crocodile.
444180	445180	A life-saving feast.
445180	446180	Right, let's get out of here.
446180	447180	Nothing easy on this.
447180	448180	Hey, it's all right.
448180	449180	It's all right.
449180	450180	It's all right.
450180	451180	That's it.
451180	452180	That's it.
452180	453180	That's it.
453180	454180	Well done.
454180	459180	As we know, caiman can take off a leg, an arm, drag you into the water, drown you,
459180	460180	eat you.
460180	461180	Not great, really.
461180	463180	So we all want to be out of here as fast as possible.
463180	466180	And as an exit operation, we're doing quite well.
466180	468180	Oh, darn you, dear.
468180	469180	Yeah.
469180	470180	Too late.
470180	471180	Too late, baby.
471180	472180	Too late, baby.
472180	473180	Too late, baby.
473180	474180	Too late, baby.
474180	475180	It's too late.
475180	481180	For these women to succeed they've got to have faith.
481180	486180	They've got to persevere and reunite because there's power in numbers.
486180	490180	My mantra is lead no man behind.
490180	495180	It's that sort of attitude that's going to make the critical difference for them.
495180	498180	I've got a beach on my left.
498180	499180	Oh, no.
499180	501180	Let's get on that.
501180	503180	Let's get an orientation.
503180	506540	The women have been trekking through the jungle for two hours,
506780	508440	but instead of finding camp,
508780	511860	they've stumbled upon another beach on the north of the island.
512640	513880	This is so hard.
515320	517360	No-one knows what the right decision is.
518380	519500	It's so thirsty.
521620	524400	I've never been so dehydrated in all my life.
524680	526560	I'm thinking about drinking seawater.
527360	529360	I know you can't, but I'm not...
529360	533940	The women scavenge the area and strike lucky.
534260	535180	We found coconut!
535800	536420	Oh, my God!
538320	540460	It's just enough to keep them going.
540560	542760	Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's do it.
543180	546660	As they head back into the jungle to try and find the others once more.
553160	556700	At camp, the damp conditions are proving problematic.
557460	558620	I really...
558620	559340	I was, of course, trying to say,
559360	560060	let's start another fire.
560680	562320	It's finding the dry stuff.
562440	564660	There's no sun. We can't see the sky.
564840	566480	Oh, but look at your little hands.
566900	568180	My hands. I'm like...
568180	568540	Can you see?
568900	569540	Like, look.
569680	571520	It's just from the wetness.
571640	572480	They're going to crack.
572780	574520	I'm in agony.
575920	578960	I've achieved everything I wanted to in my profession.
579500	581620	I'm really happy with where I've got to,
581740	584240	but I think my job is starting to define me,
584680	585740	and I don't want that.
585740	588220	I want to find out who I am again.
588220	590580	I think I have a need for adventure.
591820	596380	I just feel so driven to do something completely different.
599460	600600	It's crazy.
601320	602720	I can't let it get in my head.
603200	604460	You can't let it get in your head.
604640	604860	No.
605020	606360	It's important to be positive.
606780	607140	Right.
607360	609060	It will work out. It will.
609180	612620	We're about to work out how to make a great shelter today.
615260	617580	Unable to make fire without dry wood,
617580	620340	a shelter will protect the women from the elements
620340	622860	while they wait for the others to come back for them.
623480	625060	Push it down. Push that down.
625620	627780	No. No, this, the top one. Push that down.
628520	630320	I'll tell you what, there really is strength in numbers.
630700	633800	You really feel that there's so much more work
633800	635000	and so much more pressure on you
635000	636560	when there's just a small amount of you.
637760	639940	Oh, shit. That's it. There we go.
640280	642880	Now, with just five of us, it feels pretty lonely, actually.
643760	644940	Half an hour later,
645200	647180	and the shape of a shelter is almost complete.
647180	648180	It looks pretty good.
648180	651180	Oh, for fuck's sake.
657180	660180	Positivity, positivity, positivity.
664180	668180	The expedition party left what they've nicknamed Coconut Beach
668180	670180	nearly two hours ago,
670180	672180	and they are trekking into the thick of the jungle,
672180	674180	trying to find a camp.
674180	676180	No, we're going back on ourselves. We need to go that way.
676180	677080	There's the other coast beach.
678080	682080	With the afternoon temperature rising to over 30 degrees...
682080	684080	I'm so thirsty.
685080	688080	..their need for water is more critical than ever.
689080	692080	My biggest motivation is to get to the others.
695080	697080	Convinced they're close to camp,
697080	700080	Georgie and Lauren go ahead to recce their surroundings.
700080	702080	We're just looking.
702080	703080	They're not going anywhere.
703080	704080	We're going back to where we are.
704080	706080	We're back to where we are.
706580	708080	No fucking way.
708080	709080	Can't be.
709080	710080	We are?
710080	712080	No, we can't be.
712080	714080	We haven't done one massive se...
714080	715080	Yeah.
715080	716080	Really?
720080	724080	The expedition party have spent all day in the searing heat,
724080	727080	only to find they've walked in one big circle,
727080	729080	back to Coconut Beach.
729080	732360	in one big circle, back to Coconut Beach.
734840	736200	Guys, do you want to come down?
736280	737280	OK.
738040	741600	Without a GPS or visual landmarks to guide us,
741680	744520	human beings are naturally prone to walk in circles,
744600	747480	even when we're convinced we're going in a straight line.
747560	751520	Put dehydration into the mix, which slows down brain function
751600	754120	and the women find themselves in crisis.
755120	757960	OK, so there's some bad, bad news.
757960	759400	We're back where we were.
759480	762920	If the women don't find a proper water source soon,
763000	765000	their time on the island will end.
765080	767480	Bad news is we fucked up and we've just done a massive circle
767560	769680	and we've wasted a load of energy for nothing.
769760	771760	How the fuck did that happen?
771840	772960	All too easily.
773040	774200	We're in the jungle.
774280	776640	Got no fucking reference point.
776720	779120	And we're tired and dehydrated.
779200	782320	I vote we bed in for the night.
782400	783840	I think I'm going to cry, George.
783920	785240	I think I'm going to cry, don't you?
785320	787680	This is absolutely fucking ludicrous.
787680	790800	Physically, I don't know, people have got holes in their feet.
790880	791960	I have now.
792040	793400	We can't sustain this.
793480	796160	Oh, my God, what are we going to do back at the camp?
798280	802160	Four days ago, I abandoned a group of ordinary British women
802240	804960	on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.
805040	807480	After separating over 24 hours ago,
807560	811720	the expedition party are desperately trying to get back to camp.
811800	813880	But disorientated by the jungle,
813960	816160	they remain in the north of the island.
817680	822720	The women left waiting at camp have no fire to purify water
822800	825400	and are also worryingly dehydrated.
828960	835400	We've been drinking water from a roof by wild animals.
836920	839600	Mum of two, Julie, has been down at the rocks
839680	841720	washing the women's muddy underwear.
841800	845600	There's only five of us here at the moment.
845680	846920	The other group have got lost.
846920	848680	We've no idea where they are.
848760	854440	A couple of our groupers are just moaning all the time.
854520	857960	I mean, for God's sake, it's supposed to be survival.
858040	860240	It's not supposed to be a holiday.
860320	863120	You know what I mean? We knew it was going to be tough.
863200	866040	Facing a second night isolated from the others...
866120	868000	What the fuck?
868080	870320	..the claustrophobic jungle environment
870400	872720	is testing the women's mental strength.
872800	875920	But it's been very difficult to stay positive.
876000	876880	I don't feel we've got anything.
876960	877960	I don't have anything to look forward to.
878040	880320	I just feel like we've been dumped.
880400	882240	Can I say something positive?
882320	883920	No, fuck off.
884000	886360	I don't feel too bad, you know?
886440	889800	And I just think it can only get better.
889880	894280	To be fair, Julie, you really haven't gone on any expeditions to get anything.
894360	897960	You've kind of conserved the energy by staying in camp the most of the time.
898040	901000	You are good at talking the talk, let's do this, let's do that,
901080	903600	but actually actively doing it is a different story.
903680	905760	Maybe that's why you're feeling so good.
905840	906720	I appreciate it.
906960	911080	Everybody is really fucking pissed off.
911160	913720	All I said was a bit of positivity.
913800	917320	I've spent fucking hours rearranging wet knickers
917400	918680	and washing all around this camp.
918760	919880	I don't want you to do that, Julie!
919960	922520	And squeezing it out and hanging it up for you.
922600	924560	I've been biting my tongue all the time.
924640	926240	You don't want me to do it?
926320	929440	Personally, I feel that constantly wringing out people's knickers
929520	931880	that aren't even here in other clothes is futile.
931960	936040	The group dynamics of these five people is not working.
936120	936840	Yeah.
936880	937960	It's not productive.
938040	940760	And I'm sat here thinking, I am stuck with this.
940840	945760	But we collected it at night as well, Julie, but you just walked with us.
945840	947880	How the fuck do you keep a fire going then?
947960	949120	You're not listening to me, are you?
949200	950800	Do you know what? I'm not, you're right.
950880	954040	What I'm saying is, we should collect wood and...
954120	955640	So, I'm doing the selfie now,
955720	957760	because you really need to know how I'm feeling.
964880	966680	It's really hard.
966840	969000	I just can't get enough of the photoshoots.
992800	994320	We can't eat.
994400	996240	Because we have no fire.
996840	1001060	I don't know where everyone else is, the other group have gone missing and I'm really worried
1001060	1017580	about them, but I'm just questioning how on earth are we expected to survive in this?
1017580	1023000	On Coconut Beach in the north of the island, the expedition party remain out of water and
1023000	1027880	have decided to stay the night.
1027880	1030120	They're building a makeshift shelter.
1030120	1035820	We've basically spent two days walking for four and a half hours, that's nine hours in
1035820	1040120	total we've spent walking around this bloody island trying to get back to where we started.
1040120	1041120	Everybody's very dehydrated.
1041120	1047320	We've not had actual water for two days, it's just, it's ridiculous.
1047320	1048320	It's absolutely ridiculous.
1048320	1050320	And then the other side would go like that?
1050320	1051320	Yeah, brilliant.
1051320	1052320	And then the other side would go like that?
1052320	1052820	Yeah, brilliant.
1053000	1058380	After spotting a storm on the horizon, the women scavenge the beach for containers to
1058380	1061380	collect rainwater, their only hope of rehydrating.
1061380	1066380	We're going to have to support the bottles and this polystyrene thing so that they're
1066380	1067380	upright and they don't spill.
1067380	1074660	And we may have to keep it behind the slug so that the tide doesn't wash it out.
1074660	1077140	Finding fresh water is so important.
1077140	1082800	That combination of very oppressive 30 degree heat plus the humidity, you know, over 90%
1082800	1085180	of the time, it can easily mean the women get through a litre of water an hour.
1085180	1086180	That is a lot.
1086180	1087180	Unless they find water, I reckon the women only have one more day.
1087180	1088180	As night draws in, the women abandoned at camp are attempting to light a new fire to
1088180	1089180	purify their muddy rainwater.
1089180	1090180	Remember, all we're doing now is trying to make a hole.
1090180	1091180	It's out, it's out.
1091180	1092180	Oh, fuck's sake.
1092180	1093180	It's out.
1093180	1094180	It's out.
1094180	1095180	It's out.
1095180	1096180	It's out.
1096180	1097180	It's out.

1110180	1111180	It's out.
1111180	1112180	It's out.
1112180	1113180	It's out.
1113180	1114180	It's out.
1114180	1115180	It's out.
1115180	1116180	It's out.
1116180	1117180	It's out.
1117180	1118180	It's out.
1118180	1119180	It's out.
1119180	1120180	It's out.
1120180	1121180	It's out.
1121180	1122180	It's out.
1122180	1123180	It's out.
1123180	1124180	It's out.
1124180	1125180	It's out.
1125180	1126180	It's out.
1126180	1127180	It's out.
1127180	1128180	It's out.
1128180	1129180	It's out.
1129180	1130180	It's out.
1130180	1131180	It's out.
1131180	1132180	It's out.
1132180	1133180	It's out.
1133180	1134180	It's out.
1134180	1135180	It's out.
1135180	1136180	It's out.
1136180	1137180	It's out.
1137180	1138180	It's out.
1138180	1139180	It's out.
1139180	1141780	All day, Julie's been at me, non-stop.
1141820	1144660	I've come on this experience to try new things,
1144700	1146340	to push my comfort zones.
1146380	1147780	Hello?
1149860	1151380	Guys?
1151420	1153140	Can someone shine their light over here?
1153180	1155140	Cos I swear I'm hearing noises.
1155180	1157340	Please, it's like a...
1157380	1159220	Is someone moving?
1159260	1161820	It's coming close to me, please!
1161860	1163220	It's Julie!
1163260	1165020	Oh, fuck my life.
1165060	1167220	Oh, shit.
1167220	1170540	On Coconut Beach, the storm is still in the distance,
1170580	1173420	and the dehydrated women are pinning all their hopes
1173460	1176140	on their makeshift containers collecting rain.
1176180	1179020	I've never actually wanted water so much in my life.
1179060	1181660	Check this lightning out behind me.
1181700	1183700	Yes!
1184820	1186820	It's so cool.
1186860	1190180	I don't know if you can actually see the line of lightning.
1190220	1191980	Look, I feel like a weather girl.
1192020	1195020	I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.
1195060	1197100	I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.
1197100	1199100	I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.
1199140	1201100	And here we have...
1201140	1203100	a big, fuck-off, shiny storm.
1205140	1208140	And to the north, we have a storm.
1208180	1211140	And just there, we've got a bolt of lightning.
1214140	1217140	And I imagine around here, in just a moment,
1217180	1219140	we're going to have a bolt of lightning.
1221220	1223220	And I imagine just about there,
1223260	1225220	we're going to have a bolt of lightning.
1225260	1226500	To the right.
1226500	1228500	It's from cloud to cloud.
1234180	1238420	In a moment, we're going to have a strong north-easterly bolt of lightning.
1238460	1240460	Right there.
1243340	1246100	Hang on, we're having a few technical difficulties.
1246140	1248140	Thank you, Bob.
1248180	1251260	11pm. With the storm still a way off,
1251300	1255540	the women bed down for a long night under their makeshift shelter.
1256500	1258380	I can see the rain on this side.
1260420	1262740	All lights off.
1262780	1264580	Nighty night.
1267140	1269260	Bloody hell, have you farted in my face again?
1269300	1271140	Sorry, I did.
1281660	1286180	It's 5.30am and the storm has finally hit the island.
1286180	1289380	The women are hoping their containers are full of rainwater.
1290960	1293860	We've just had the most uncomfortable sleep of our lives.
1294260	1295040	It's just a nightmare.
1295600	1297780	I just hope we can get some water in as soon.
1301300	1303840	Can I just share something with you, everybody?
1304660	1306980	Really bad news, we have no water
1306980	1309160	because the tide has washed our bottles away.
1309800	1310320	Nothing.
1310660	1310940	Fuck.
1311220	1311560	Fuck.
1311680	1312860	Oh, fuck.
1313580	1314980	I feel like I could cry right now.
1314980	1316900	I seriously think I could cry.
1317820	1319040	I think I need a little shit.
1320260	1323740	After almost 48 hours with hardly anything to drink,
1324120	1326540	the women sourced just a handful of coconuts.
1328060	1329980	Oh, my God, this one's cold!
1330240	1330800	Ah!
1332580	1335700	But with only enough liquid to have a few sips each,
1336020	1338160	one woman is finding it all too much.
1339200	1340220	You all right, Kate?
1340820	1341620	Just struggling.
1344980	1346900	I'm really struggling, guys.
1346900	1348460	Come on, come on, come on.
1348460	1349460	Give some love.
1349460	1351460	I'm really, really missing my girl.
1354580	1358420	I've decided to do this because, having been made redundant four times,
1358420	1363380	it left me feeling worthless and a burden on everybody.
1363940	1366460	And I wanted to set myself a challenge
1366460	1368620	and do something that was extremely difficult,
1368620	1371740	but that I had to do, and that I can't walk away from it.
1371740	1374820	I have more confidence in myself.
1374980	1377020	I make my children proud of me.
1377020	1378620	I make my husband, Chris, proud of me.
1380620	1382700	I just feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew.
1382700	1383740	No, not at all.
1383740	1385500	I'm with God, you are doing brilliant.
1385500	1386740	You are doing absolutely brilliant,
1386740	1388740	and they're going to be so proud of you.
1388740	1389740	I know.
1389740	1391740	I just want to speak to Chris.
1391740	1392340	I know.
1392340	1394540	And have him say, keep going.
1394540	1396340	You can't do everything through your kids and your husband.
1396340	1397300	You have to have some me time.
1397300	1399540	But I like doing everything through them.
1399540	1400540	OK, well, that's cool.
1401660	1404220	I think initially, when people get marooned,
1404220	1404860	it's all about the fun.
1404860	1406660	The physical, the fact that they're tired,
1406660	1408660	and they're hungry, and they're hurting.
1408660	1411300	But after a while, people become accustomed to that.
1411300	1414380	But then the battle becomes something much more meaningful.
1414380	1416620	Actually, the fact that you're missing your loved ones.
1416620	1419500	And those battles can be much harder.
1422180	1424340	I'm so thirsty.
1424340	1429780	I haven't managed to find any water.
1429780	1431500	I'm so thirsty.
1431500	1432500	Look at that.
1434860	1441780	The good news for the women is that in tropical storm season,
1441780	1445540	the weather can change in an instant.
1445540	1449540	Guys, guys, bring your pots.
1449540	1451460	It's running like a bloody tap.
1451460	1454340	The return of the rain proves to be their salvation.
1454340	1455340	Yes.
1455340	1456340	Woo-hoo.
1456340	1457340	Yes.
1457340	1458340	First in the jungle.
1458340	1459340	Ah.
1459340	1462340	Watch my mouth, they think.
1462340	1463340	Oh, my god.
1463340	1464340	Oh, my god.
1464340	1465340	This is amazing.
1465340	1466340	Wow.
1466340	1467340	Cheers.
1467340	1468340	Cheers.
1468340	1469340	Oh, my god.
1469340	1470340	That is just the best feeling.
1470340	1471340	Yeah, baby.
1471340	1472340	From the most miserable situation to the most joyous situation.
1472340	1473340	Yeah, see?
1473340	1474340	We go up, we go down, we go up, we go down.
1474340	1492620	We were right through the floor down, and now we're elated.
1492620	1493620	Rehydrated.
1493620	1494620	Time to dive.
1494620	1495620	And with bottles full of water.
1495620	1496620	And we came down this one.
1496620	1497620	The expedition party set off.
1497620	1498620	Confident they'll finally rescue the others.
1498620	1499620	Okay, so we're on the right track.
1499620	1500620	In the jungle.
1500620	1501620	The mighty jungle.
1501620	1502620	The lion sneaks tonight.
1502620	1503620	Go.
1503620	1504620	A-wimboing.
1504620	1505620	A-wimboing.
1505620	1506620	A-wimboing.
1506620	1507620	A-wimboing.
1507620	1508620	A-wimboing.
1508620	1509620	A-wimboing.
1509620	1510620	A-wimboing.
1510620	1511620	A-wimboing.
1511620	1512620	A-wimboing.
1512620	1513620	A-wimboing.
1513620	1514620	A-wimboing.
1514620	1515620	A-wimboing.
1515620	1516620	A-wimboing.
1516620	1517620	A-wimboing.
1517620	1518620	A-wimboing.
1518620	1519620	A-wimboing.
1519620	1520620	A-wimboing.
1520620	1521620	A-wimboing.
1521620	1522620	A-wimboing.
1522620	1523620	A-wimboing.
1531040	1534860	It's the women's fifth day on the island.
1534860	1539620	And the two groups have been separated for over two days.
1539620	1542620	Spirits are buoyed with bottles full of rain water,
1542620	1546100	but the expedition party are going round in circles,
1546100	1547940	trying to return to camp
1547940	1549940	to rescue the women waiting.
1551940	1553940	We want to stay in a straight line.
1553940	1555940	Nobody's disagreeing with you.
1555940	1557940	We will have to make little diversions.
1557940	1559940	No, that way.
1559940	1562940	Mum of two, Kate, remains desperately homesick,
1562940	1564940	missing her family.
1564940	1566940	Just doing my head in.
1566940	1569940	Because I'm not doing another night in this jungle like this.
1569940	1571940	That will be it for me, and I've made that decision.
1571940	1573940	If we don't make it back... You feel that strongly about it now?
1573940	1575940	Yep, and I know the people who matter to me the most
1575940	1578940	won't care if I come home early, to be honest.
1578940	1580940	Kate, calm down. We're going the right direction.
1580940	1582940	It might not be... I'm not talking to you.
1582940	1584940	..like a path. I'm talking to George.
1584940	1587940	I know. Fucking attitude and a half, you do.
1589940	1591940	And you can kiss my fucking arse.
1593940	1596940	If these women are going to survive, they've got to learn quickly
1596940	1598940	how to work together as a team.
1599940	1602940	Pulling together is paramount in times of crisis,
1602940	1604940	and the truth is we always survive better
1604940	1605940	when we're together.
1605940	1608940	When we cooperate and when we don't fight.
1608940	1611940	Um, there's only... Please, no negativity.
1611940	1613940	We just need to keep on this positively.
1613940	1616940	I know you've got a really bad attitude, Kate.
1616940	1618940	I haven't. I'm just fed up.
1618940	1621940	You're speaking to everyone with a really bad tone,
1621940	1624940	so can everybody please stop arguing?
1624940	1626940	Because it's really not helping.
1626940	1628940	But maybe we should just, for the next ten minutes,
1628940	1630940	all of us just say completely nothing
1630940	1632940	and just concentrate on walking and following Fee.
1636940	1638940	No, that way.
1638940	1640940	Guys, I think we need to go that way.
1640940	1642940	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1642940	1644940	Silence.
1644940	1647940	I'm asking a few group of women to keep silent.
1647940	1649940	We lasted literally ten...
1649940	1652940	Everyone, good idea. Ten seconds.
1657940	1661940	At camp, the group have spent over two days with no food,
1661940	1664940	drinking just small amounts of rainwater,
1664940	1667940	waiting for the expedition party to return.
1667940	1671940	And damp conditions have brought out the jungle critters.
1671940	1674940	Like, right now, all my arse is proper itchy.
1674940	1678940	It's only got a few bites, but above it, my face, my hands...
1678940	1680940	Shiaz, we've just looked at her arse.
1680940	1682940	Oh, yeah, we have just looked at her bum.
1683940	1686940	The rain last night was ridiculous.
1686940	1688940	Like, I was just...
1688940	1691940	I'm so ill that I just need to sleep.
1691940	1693940	Like, my throat, I can't swallow.
1693940	1695940	I don't know how to do this.
1695940	1699940	I want to show everyone I can do this, but it's really hard.
1701940	1704940	Whenever I have a problem, my parents always help me out.
1704940	1707940	Right now, my dad pays for everything that I want.
1707940	1710940	My boyfriend looks after me, especially on nights out.
1710940	1713940	They see me as their baby that they still need to protect.
1713940	1717940	I don't do anything by myself, and I want to be more independent.
1717940	1719940	I want to do something for myself
1719940	1722940	and just be able to be like, yes, I did that.
1723940	1728940	The worst part is I'm starting to think that my parents were right.
1728940	1730940	I shouldn't have done this.
1734940	1737940	Back in the jungle, Forrester's daughter, Fi,
1737940	1740940	has taken over leadership of the trek back to camp.
1740940	1744940	But it's only taken half an hour for the mood to disintegrate.
1744940	1747940	We really strongly think we need to go right here.
1747940	1749940	I've got to say, I do agree.
1749940	1750940	Oh, brilliant.
1750940	1751940	We have been travelling in the past,
1751940	1754940	we have been travelling in this direction.
1754940	1755940	No, we haven't.
1755940	1757940	We've been travelling in that direction.
1757940	1758940	No.
1758940	1759940	Yeah.
1759940	1760940	No.
1760940	1763940	Why is it you're so adamant you're right all the time?
1763940	1764940	Just hold on.
1764940	1766940	I'm not adamant I'm right all the time.
1766940	1769940	Yes, you are, because you're dismissing everybody else.
1769940	1770940	Listen, I understand.
1770940	1771940	Fi will not listen.
1771940	1774940	Jeez, I live in the woods, so I always circumnavigate woods.
1774940	1775940	Well done.
1775940	1779940	But we spent the night last night in a place that we had just left.
1779940	1780940	You never noticed... That was my fault.
1780940	1781940	..that we'd double back on us.
1781940	1782940	That was my fault.
1782940	1783940	We never noticed we'd double back.
1783940	1784940	Because she wasn't in charge.
1784940	1788940	It's often when stress levels are high that all the social graces fall away,
1788940	1790940	and it's also when tempers fray.
1790940	1794940	They've got to learn quickly how to communicate better as a team.
1794940	1799940	At this point, their survival and that of the women at camp depends on it.
1799940	1801940	We have to spend another night in this jungle like this.
1801940	1802940	I'm out of here.
1802940	1804940	You need to listen to people.
1804940	1805940	You don't listen to anybody.
1805940	1809940	I do think that you really don't listen to anybody.
1809940	1812940	And this is actually... Is this life or death?
1812940	1816940	I'm just so tempted to tell you to take the lead and do it.
1816940	1821940	Yeah, cos then if I leave, it's my own fault, because I'd have got us lost.
1821940	1822940	And give up.
1822940	1824940	OK, I have the machete.
1828940	1830940	Oh, my God! What?
1830940	1833940	Help! Becky!
1833940	1834940	Becky!
1834940	1837940	I'm coming!
1837940	1838940	Call the medics!
1839940	1840940	She's gone!
1840940	1842940	Bran! Bran's fainted!
1842940	1845940	Radio in, medic, now!
1845940	1847940	She's absolutely fucking boiling.
1847940	1848940	Oh, my God!
1848940	1851940	With Belinda, the only doctor amongst her 13 women,
1851940	1853940	lost with the expedition party,
1853940	1858940	the group at camp must radio for a safety response team to intervene.
1858940	1860940	Doctor Bravo, do you copy?
1860940	1861940	We see you missing, girl.
1861940	1863940	Bran, passed out.
1863940	1867940	They are on standby on a nearby island in case of emergency.
1867940	1868940	Erm...
1868940	1870940	She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.
1870940	1871940	Oh, my God!
1871940	1873940	This is way fucking beyond any fucking joke.
1873940	1875940	Everyone needs off here, I swear to God.
1875940	1878940	It's not a programme. It's fucking ridiculous.
1878940	1881940	Having gone to the rocks for air,
1881940	1884940	after five days with barely any food or water,
1884940	1887940	Fran has taken a serious turn for the worse.
1891940	1894940	The safety response team arrive.
1894940	1896940	Hello, Fran.
1896940	1901940	We're just dealing with a flat, squirrely cause at that location.
1901940	1903940	I think the problem is with Fran.
1903940	1904940	I think she's not a moaner.
1904940	1906940	I think she's been far iller than we knew.
1911940	1913940	We're going to put her on a stretcher,
1913940	1915940	we're going to take her on our boat,
1915940	1917940	and then we're going to do proper assessment
1917940	1919940	and see what needs to happen from there.
1922940	1924940	With the group at camp a member down
1924940	1928940	and the expedition party lost with dwindling water supplies,
1928940	1931940	the women's existence on the island hangs in the balance.
1933940	1934940	Look at that.
1942940	1945940	We need a radio in, medic, now.
1945940	1949940	The 13 women have been split apart for two days.
1949940	1952940	She's collapsed. Oh, my God!
1952940	1953940	And the group at camp
1953940	1956940	are now a member down after Fran collapsed
1956940	1958940	and was evacuated from the island.
1959940	1961940	Another one gone?
1961940	1964940	I knew she was poorlier than we thought.
1964940	1966940	Out at sea, my safety response team
1966940	1969940	are assessing 24-year-old Fran.
1969940	1972940	It says 72 and 146.
1973940	1977940	I don't care how, like, dehydrated or faint I am,
1977940	1979940	the rest of us are exactly the same.
1979940	1981940	I shouldn't get any privileged treatment
1981940	1982940	over feeling a bit sick.
1982940	1984940	I'm just really pissed off at myself.
1984940	1986940	I know I can do this.
1986940	1990940	Till I faint 400 times, you're not allowed to take me off that thing.
1990940	1994940	After five days without anywhere near enough water,
1994940	1997940	Fran has succumbed to dehydration.
1997940	2000940	And with the expedition party still nowhere in sight,
2000940	2003940	the other four women are equally at risk.
2003940	2005940	What the hell?
2005940	2008940	There's so many people dropping off.
2008940	2011940	I'm just worried there's going to be more and more.
2011940	2014940	Because people can't stand these conditions.
2015940	2018940	Fran's coming back. Fran's coming back.
2018940	2019940	Is she really?
2022940	2026940	Fran's body temperature and heart rate have returned to normal.
2026940	2028940	And in Dr Belinda's absence,
2028940	2032940	the safety response team deem her fit enough to rejoin the others.
2032940	2035940	Is it like heaven, seeing us?
2035940	2036940	Oh, I'm sure.
2036940	2039940	I'm sure there's things she'd rather see than us.
2039940	2040940	I had to beg her.
2041940	2044940	I had to beg them to let me back on the island.
2044940	2046940	I just had to come back, though,
2046940	2048940	cos, like, then it would be only four girls here
2048940	2051940	and I couldn't leave them.
2051940	2053940	I'm so glad I'm back.
2055940	2058940	The expedition party have been walking for two days,
2058940	2061940	trying to find their way back to camp.
2061940	2063940	This is where I feel we should go.
2063940	2065940	This looks like a pretty good path.
2065940	2067940	Having wrestled leadership of the group,
2067940	2069940	homesick mum of two, Kate,
2069940	2072940	is now guiding the women through the jungle.
2072940	2075940	This is going to go well.
2075940	2076940	Just keep going.
2076940	2078940	This is where you want to go.
2078940	2081940	The thought of not getting there, stressing me out, you know?
2081940	2082940	We will get there.
2082940	2085940	I'm not confident to take responsibility for this.
2085940	2087940	OK, well, where are we going now?
2087940	2088940	Where are we going now?
2088940	2090940	Just keep going straight. No more confrontational arguing.
2090940	2091940	Just keep walking.
2091940	2093940	It's just that way. Keep going, keep going, keep going.
2093940	2095940	Well, I'm losing my confidence now.
2095940	2096940	I don't want to lead.
2096940	2097940	I'm sorry, I don't want to lead this group.
2097940	2098940	I don't want to.
2098940	2100940	I'll lead it. You tell me where to go.
2100940	2101940	Or do you know what?
2101940	2102940	Or you lead. What do you think?
2102940	2104940	And I'm just saying a word. No, no, no.
2104940	2105940	No, I'm not going to say another word
2105940	2107940	because I'm having a complete crisis of confidence in myself.
2107940	2109940	I'm so scared.
2109940	2110940	We're all scared.
2110940	2111940	Because you were so confident.
2111940	2113940	Yeah, but that's... I know, but...
2113940	2115940	Now it's gone.
2115940	2116940	My confidence is gone.
2116940	2118940	Sorry, I should just keep my mouth shut.
2118940	2119940	You lead the way, Faye, please.
2119940	2120940	Fuck!
2128940	2132940	After over two days of waiting and now dangerously dehydrated,
2132940	2137940	the women at camp are finally taking their fate into their own hands.
2137940	2141940	They haven't found us, so we've got no alternative but to find them.
2141940	2143940	Because we've stayed and we've waited, I don't even know,
2143940	2146940	two days, three days, to be rescued.
2146940	2148940	If we don't find them,
2148940	2151940	I think we're going to make a raft and go to another island.
2151940	2156940	I just never, ever want to see this spot ever in my life again.
2156940	2157940	Until now, staying put.
2157940	2160940	Staying put has actually been the surest way
2160940	2162940	of allowing the others to try and find them.
2162940	2166940	But after days with no fire, dwindling water supplies, no food,
2166940	2170940	the women now need to weigh out the dangers of striking out into the unknown
2170940	2174940	against the risk of waiting it out with no more resources.
2174940	2177940	Now we have to just go and blow our whistles madly
2177940	2179940	to see if anyone's hearing us, and that's what we're going to do.
2179940	2182940	That's the plan. Blow, blow, blow.
2182940	2185940	Everybody in this group is good at blowing, yeah?
2185940	2186940	Yeah?
2186940	2187940	I think we're all...
2187940	2189940	We're the reason blowers here.
2189940	2190940	Yeah, girls?
2190940	2191940	Yes.
2193940	2196940	Unaware of the expedition party's whereabouts,
2196940	2199940	the five women are searching the coastline.
2200940	2204940	Our journey to find the other team begins now.
2205940	2206940	Whoa.
2207940	2208940	Are you all right, sweetheart?
2208940	2209940	Yeah, sorry.
2209940	2210940	Cracking on.
2210940	2211940	Good on you.
2211940	2212940	Oh, it's so cold.
2212940	2214940	Oh, my gosh, my knickers are getting wet.
2214940	2215940	Oh, my God.
2215940	2216940	At least our fannies will feel fresher.
2216940	2218940	Yeah.
2218940	2222940	Having left Coconut Beach three hours ago,
2222940	2225940	the expedition party are completely lost
2225940	2228940	and their water supply is fast disappearing.
2228940	2231940	After homesick mum of two, Kate, quit as leader,
2231940	2233940	Georgie recognises where they are.
2235940	2236940	Oh, my God.
2236940	2238940	I made these, Mark.
2238940	2240940	I knew I recognised this place.
2241940	2245940	The women are convinced they are finally about to find camp.
2245940	2248940	Do you remember you, me and Abi did a recce?
2248940	2250940	This is where we came to.
2250940	2251940	I know.
2251940	2252940	I know.
2252940	2253940	That's what I was just saying.
2253940	2254940	They're just down there.
2258940	2262940	I'm ecstatic just because I got the hell out of Shit Creek.
2262940	2264940	Fuck, that's so fucking deep.
2264940	2267940	That's up to my tits, so that's swimming for Fran.
2269940	2272940	It feels desperate because we feel so close right now.
2272940	2273940	No!
2275940	2276940	Yeah.
2276940	2278940	We haven't had a response on the signal.
2284940	2285940	I'm coming out.
2285940	2286940	Along the coast,
2286940	2289940	the group from camp have entered the mangrove swamps.
2291940	2292940	Are we?
2293940	2294940	OK. OK.
2294940	2295940	I can't do this.
2295940	2296940	I've got you. I've got you.
2296940	2298940	You can totally do this.
2298940	2299940	One, two, three.
2301940	2302940	There we go.
2302940	2304940	With the sweltering midday sun beating down on us,
2304940	2305940	the dehydrated women,
2305940	2308940	55-year-old cashier Julie is struggling.
2308940	2309940	Oh, fuck.
2309940	2310940	It's all right, hold me.
2310940	2311940	Back one's in now.
2311940	2312940	Left and right, left and right.
2312940	2313940	There.
2313940	2314940	That's it.
2315940	2316940	OK, so feet...
2316940	2317940	I need to leave me boots.
2317940	2319940	No, you're going to need to take those with you.
2319940	2320940	You're going to need them.
2320940	2321940	So we can do it.
2321940	2322940	We'll just take our time.
2323940	2324940	No rush.
2325940	2326940	We'll just take our time.
2328940	2329940	Oh, friggin' hell.
2330940	2331940	Oh, fuck.
2331940	2333940	Oh, friggin' hell.
2333940	2334940	Oh, God.
2334940	2335940	Right?
2335940	2336940	Yeah, thanks.
2341940	2342940	Another mark.
2342940	2343940	Look, another one.
2344940	2345940	Snap.
2345940	2346940	Yeah, brilliant.
2349940	2350940	Yeah, this is it.
2350940	2351940	This is good.
2351940	2352940	I recognise this.
2354940	2356940	We're so damn close, though.
2356940	2357940	So close.
2357940	2358940	This does look familiar.
2358940	2362940	We're literally round this corner.
2362940	2364940	Is that a pink potty down there?
2364940	2365940	Yes.
2365940	2366940	So you recognise it?
2367940	2369940	We're at Coconut fucking Beach.
2369940	2370940	No, we're not.
2371940	2373940	Yeah, we're at Coconut Beach.
2373940	2374940	We are.
2374940	2375940	You're right, we are.
2375940	2376940	What the fuck?
2378940	2380940	Come on, let's get down there.
2380940	2382940	I can't fucking deal with this.
2384940	2386940	The women have circled back to Coconut Beach
2386940	2387940	for a second time.
2387940	2390940	Having pushed through the jungle for two days,
2390940	2393940	they're not one step closer to camp.
2393940	2396940	How the fuck is that possible?
2398940	2399940	How is this possible?
2399940	2402940	We kept the sea to our left the whole time.
2403940	2405940	After conquering the mangroves,
2405940	2408940	the group from camp continue north.
2410940	2412940	Guys, it's a beach!
2412940	2413940	Woo!
2414940	2415940	I can't believe we're here.
2415940	2418940	Becky, this is what I've been dreaming of.
2420940	2423940	After five days being trapped in the jungle,
2423940	2426940	they remain determined to find the expedition party.
2428940	2430940	I thought we were so fucking close,
2430940	2432940	like, three minutes away.
2432940	2435940	It's only round the corner, but we can't fucking navigate.
2435940	2437940	We cannot navigate through that.
2437940	2440940	I'm stressed because I thought we were so close.
2440940	2443940	And then I can't walk and I'm just fucked
2443940	2444940	and we're all fucked.
2445940	2446940	It sucks.
2455940	2458940	Three nights without water,
2458940	2460940	fucking trousers like this.
2461940	2463940	I can't do it. No way.
2463940	2466940	I was wanting to see them and see if they were OK.
2468940	2470940	How the fuck did that happen?
2470940	2472940	I don't even understand.
2472940	2474940	We cannot walk anywhere on this island
2474940	2475940	and we're getting lost.
2479940	2480940	It's a maze.
2482940	2484940	It's the world's trickiest maze.
2488940	2491940	Shall we have a 30-second shade break?
2491940	2492940	No.
2492940	2494940	I need to go and see.
2494940	2495940	OK.
2504940	2507940	Another beach, but not as nice as the one we're on.
2508940	2509940	Hang on.
2509940	2512940	Is that a load of clothes hanging in that tree?
2513940	2515940	Hello!
2520940	2522940	What? I can hear someone.
2522940	2525940	I'll be back to pick you up.
2526940	2539280	This is the 35thвер fact of all the
2540940	2542940	Yeah.
2542940	2544940	I think I've got to pick it up.
2544940	2545940	Oh!
2547940	2548940	Woo!
2548940	2549940	Woo!
2549940	2569440	How ever bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity, you know, survival is
2569440	2574500	about dogged determination, learning from your failures and never giving up.
2574500	2598100	Finally, back together, the women take a moment to savour their island home.
2598100	2603280	We needed them, we've all got different strengths and weaknesses that help, it's just kind of
2603280	2604280	complete.
2604280	2623020	By evening, with the reunited group, 13 women strong, it's all hands on deck to light a
2623020	2626600	new fire.
2626600	2632060	But after being lost for two days, island survival has taken its toll on mum of two,
2632060	2633060	Kate.
2633060	2634060	It's just a dream.
2634060	2635060	It's just the whole end.
2635060	2636060	The blunt end.
2636060	2641060	If I'm really honest with you, I can't see it getting any better.
2641060	2646060	I feel really tired and very, very emotional.
2646060	2652060	To try and be a part of this group, but they're not the people I need to be with.
2652060	2658720	I need to be with my family.
2658720	2660820	And I just need to be at home.
2660820	2662060	The general feeling is, I'm not going to be home.
2662060	2663060	I'm going to be home.
2663060	2664060	I'm going to be home.
2664060	2665060	Take me home, please.
2665060	2666060	Take me home, please.
2666060	2667060	By morning, furniture maker Kate has made her decision.
2667060	2668060	I'm not going home because I'm dehydrated.
2668060	2669060	I'm not going home because I can't pack it.
2669060	2674060	I'm going home because I want to be at home.
2674060	2676060	You contribute so much.
2676060	2679060	You really do.
2679060	2683060	But it's been difficult for me because I've been missing people so much.
2683060	2692060	That won't be possible with any help.
2692060	2695260	You've been missing people so much. That won't get any easier.
2695300	2696660	That'll get worse.
2698460	2701460	Oh, my God, it's horrible seeing another one go.
2701500	2703220	I thought she'd hang on in there.
2703260	2705660	We need everybody, and she had good knowledge
2705700	2707900	of bloody building and stuff.
2710180	2712460	Mum was fucking pissed off.
2713740	2717620	I just think it's weak of her to do that.
2717660	2719540	She's giving up too easily.
2719580	2721900	We need each other to boost each other up.
2721900	2723900	But it's the old thing, isn't it?
2723940	2726580	Kids, mum and her kids.
2726620	2729020	It's the old pull.
2729060	2731300	Men can do it, but a lot of women can't.
2733180	2735380	After barely a week on the island,
2735420	2737820	a second member of the team has quit.
2739700	2741420	And with power in numbers,
2741460	2744540	the women's ability to survive is diminishing.
2748500	2749820	I'm a bit pissed off.
2749860	2751060	I think it's a great shame,
2751100	2751860	because the hit was a great one.
2751940	2755980	It was a fantastic experiment to see how 14 women could cope
2756020	2757580	in this situation.
2757620	2758820	And two of them have gone already,
2758860	2761420	and I don't think that shows us all in particularly good light.
2768580	2770060	Next time on the island...
2770100	2773020	Sometimes out here can feel like you've been hit
2773060	2775100	by a major disaster.
2775140	2776780	So thin now.
2776820	2778660	All sorts of bones appearing
2778700	2781220	that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.
2781220	2784140	We need to find a solid source of food
2784180	2785940	or we could be facing meltdown.
2785980	2787300	Every fucker's bitching and moaning
2787340	2789340	that you're doing fuck all when it comes to water.
2789380	2793380	I'd say we're 95% sure we've got a caiman in our second trap.
2793420	2794540	Holy fuck.
2794580	2796340	Come on, baby.
2796380	2797620	Sam, get out of the water, mate.
2797660	2799180	Watch him, watch him. Go now, go now.
