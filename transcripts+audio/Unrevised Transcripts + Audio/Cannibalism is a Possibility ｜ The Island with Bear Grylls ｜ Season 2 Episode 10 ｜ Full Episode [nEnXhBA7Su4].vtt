WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.640 --> 00:22.980
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

00:22.980 --> 00:31.560
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools

00:31.560 --> 00:37.800
and fishing equipment how many fishing lines have you hooked up before film filming everything

00:37.800 --> 00:46.980
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

00:46.980 --> 00:52.200
strength the winds a day who will have what it takes

00:52.200 --> 00:52.960
to

00:52.960 --> 00:56.980
to stay alive tonight we follow the men's Island

00:59.140 --> 01:07.900
every single time it's little old me I don't trust you survival will be harder than ever

01:09.700 --> 01:13.300
they'll have to endure the height of the harsh tropical storm season

01:14.920 --> 01:22.720
they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food you took the hook of the lot

01:22.960 --> 01:27.600
and these Monday men oh got what it takes to survive

01:32.020 --> 01:32.680
foreign

01:38.260 --> 01:45.700
four weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island hello

01:45.700 --> 01:49.360
you can see Pierce's heart beating through his rib despite their best efforts

01:50.240 --> 01:50.740
so

01:52.960 --> 01:55.680
been able to find a sustainable source of food.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.840
We need some decent food, we need it quick.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.120
And the men are getting weaker by the day.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.040
Exhausted.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.980
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

02:05.980 --> 02:08.580
The group's become increasingly fractured.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.980
You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people

02:10.980 --> 02:14.340
is physically easy and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.

02:14.340 --> 02:16.900
So far, it's 47-year-old Vic,

02:16.900 --> 02:19.920
the island's top hunter, who's managed to save the group

02:19.920 --> 02:20.760
from starvation.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.260
When in doubt, send Vic out!

02:36.660 --> 02:39.880
If I laid back, a little bit further into the sun,

02:41.140 --> 02:42.940
it would feel like I was on holiday.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.420
Apart from the fact that later on,

02:48.420 --> 02:50.580
I'm gonna have to walk half a mile

02:50.580 --> 02:50.740
for one night.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.880
Water, fish until we can eat,

02:53.880 --> 02:55.280
and chop a load of firewood.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.680
Potentially the shittest holiday anyone will ever go on.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.180
The men have now been living on the island for a month.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.560
Unable to find a reliable source of food,

03:20.560 --> 03:24.140
they've had to survive on a meagre low-calorie diet

03:24.140 --> 03:27.540
of limpets, coconut, and the occasional fish.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.740
We are starting to starve.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.680
We're not eating enough.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.540
I mean, look, I've never seen my ribcage like that

03:33.540 --> 03:36.780
since I was bloody 12 or 13.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.700
I've got a bloody lollipop head.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.860
It looks wrong size to my body.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.580
It looks completely out of place.

03:42.580 --> 03:43.680
There's nothing to me.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.700
After four weeks on such an extreme, low-calorie diet,

03:47.700 --> 03:49.700
the men are actually in danger of entering what's called,

03:49.700 --> 03:52.060
autophagy.

03:52.060 --> 03:54.460
And this literally means to self-eat.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.940
Their bodies start to cannibalize themselves,

03:56.940 --> 03:59.200
and if they don't find a sustainable food source

03:59.200 --> 04:01.920
for the long-term, their physical condition

04:01.920 --> 04:04.460
won't just be in decline, it'll be in free fall.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.500
We'll start with Charlie, what are you doing?

04:12.500 --> 04:13.840
I'm building. Phil?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.120
I'm doing water and wood,

04:15.120 --> 04:17.400
and then chipping in for whatever needs doing.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.240
You're man.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.080
For the exhausted men,

04:21.080 --> 04:23.460
the morning meeting has become a vital way

04:23.460 --> 04:25.440
of sharing out their daily chores.

04:26.660 --> 04:27.900
Trapping assistant.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.740
Good man.

04:28.740 --> 04:29.980
Vic's gonna do water, wood,

04:29.980 --> 04:32.820
and help anybody else doing whatever they need doing.

04:32.820 --> 04:33.840
Sam?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.440
The hunting is the thing

04:35.440 --> 04:37.200
that I'm probably the most excited by.

04:38.120 --> 04:38.960
For a personal level,

04:38.960 --> 04:42.640
I don't think I've quite achieved my personal ambition yet.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.380
My personal ambition would be to catch a vulture

04:45.380 --> 04:46.220
or something like that.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.600
It's a lot of effort to do, isn't it?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.240
Will you be doing wood, then?

04:50.240 --> 04:51.960
Well, when I get back, I can do wood, but...

04:51.960 --> 04:54.280
You've got a master skill at avoiding that wood job,

04:54.280 --> 04:55.680
haven't you?

04:55.680 --> 04:57.520
If you don't bust a gut getting wood,

04:57.520 --> 04:59.160
we're gonna run out, and everybody's gonna know

04:59.160 --> 05:02.020
you were on wood, you were a lazy bastard.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.920
The group has given Sam his orders for the day,

05:04.920 --> 05:06.340
but he's not convinced.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.180
Collecting firewood's important,

05:09.180 --> 05:10.920
and I'll do my bit, definitely,

05:10.920 --> 05:12.920
but I'd love to do a bit more hunting.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.320
And, you know, it's that man against beast thing

05:17.320 --> 05:18.160
that I really enjoy.

05:18.240 --> 05:23.240
Yeah, this is not dangerous.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.360
With around 30 liters of water

05:30.360 --> 05:33.380
and up to 50 kilos of firewood to collect,

05:33.380 --> 05:35.660
the men have a grueling morning ahead of them.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.260
This wood is ridiculous.

05:40.260 --> 05:41.100
Go on, man.

05:41.100 --> 05:41.940
Look at this.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.760
Go on, man.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.600
Go on.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.580
Let's roll.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.420
Yay!

05:48.240 --> 05:49.080
Yeah!

05:49.080 --> 05:49.900
Yeah!

05:54.400 --> 05:56.700
Against the express wishes of the group,

05:56.700 --> 05:59.960
Sam has decided to spend the morning bird trapping

05:59.960 --> 06:01.280
instead of chopping wood.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.120
It's quite exciting.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.920
So I'm under a little hide.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.760
Not the best hide in the world, but a hide.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.460
And I've got this little cord here.

06:15.460 --> 06:20.460
And hopefully, the vulture's going to come down,

06:20.460 --> 06:23.420
grab the meat, and I'll pull this rope,

06:23.420 --> 06:25.420
and we'll be in business.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.420
Let's just wait and see.

06:27.420 --> 06:33.420
I work on foreign news stories.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.420
The problem with news is you always go to

06:35.420 --> 06:37.420
some of the nastiest places in the world.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.420
I have been shot at.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.420
I've had a near kidnapping.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.620
But I try to avoid those sort of things as best I can.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.580
I'm aware that I'm incredibly privileged.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.580
You know, I haven't met the queen,

06:50.580 --> 06:52.580
but I have had an amazing opportunity

06:52.580 --> 06:54.580
to meet people from every different sphere of life.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.580
I would hope that I'm not prejudiced.

06:58.580 --> 07:03.580
I do have opinions, but I've got a bit of grace to me.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.540
Dad, I'm hiding for a vulture.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.980
And you're slightly spoiling it.

07:16.580 --> 07:17.580
Where are you?

07:17.580 --> 07:18.580
I'm hiding here.

07:18.580 --> 07:19.580
Ready for a vulture.

07:20.580 --> 07:23.700
Oh, for fuck's sake.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.820
The whole point of the morning meeting

07:24.820 --> 07:28.460
is to get distinct tasks.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.880
If he's got a task,

07:29.880 --> 07:32.860
he needs to complete the task before any passing.

07:32.860 --> 07:33.080
Phe皇 night.

07:33.080 --> 07:33.580
Now...

07:33.580 --> 07:35.340
or it moves on to something else.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.980
Softly, softly is not working anymore,

07:36.980 --> 07:39.780
so we just need to be a bit more firm with people, I think.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.260
Sam, we need you to stick to our tasks,

07:43.260 --> 07:44.700
otherwise we're not gonna get shit done.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.460
It's like nearly 11 o'clock and you haven't done any.

07:46.460 --> 07:47.300
Good to do.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.140
I'm heading there now,

07:48.140 --> 07:50.180
and it's raining coconut for the doom trap as well.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.700
But you're not doing traps, we're doing traps.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.940
You're not doing traps, are you?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.100
You just concentrate on what you're supposed to be doing.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.580
If you've got a task, stick to it, complete it, finish it.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.420
Right.

07:59.420 --> 08:00.260
Good.

08:00.260 --> 08:04.540
I don't know, I don't know.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.060
Bloke Talk's a good, nice, posh game,

08:06.060 --> 08:08.100
but failing to deliver in my book,

08:08.100 --> 08:11.860
and an island where manual graft is king.

08:11.860 --> 08:14.100
We all have to work and sweat.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.700
Oops, now I ain't done jack shit.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.740
Shall I drop this in then, me old brute?

08:23.740 --> 08:26.340
Sam's reluctance to fall in with the others

08:26.340 --> 08:29.020
is starting to affect his reputation in the group.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.020
Do you know, I've given up trying to second-guess Sam Farmer.

08:33.020 --> 08:36.340
He's his own man, he sort of exists in another world.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.260
He's an airhead, isn't he, and he's...

08:38.260 --> 08:40.340
Oh, yes, oh, yeah, er...

08:40.340 --> 08:41.180
Vultures.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.780
Exactly, he must get a bird trap.

08:43.780 --> 08:47.140
And I think everyone feels the bird traps are a waste of time.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.340
There's a bit of selfishness there.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.500
I don't, I think...

08:53.500 --> 08:55.140
But I don't think it means to be selfish,

08:55.140 --> 08:56.940
I just think that's the way it's been brought on.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.780
For me, and this is my opinion,

08:58.780 --> 09:01.740
if that is something that Sam wants to do,

09:01.740 --> 09:03.500
he'll work fucking hard for it.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.100
Agreed. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.940
I just think he's had his arse wiped for him for the most of his life.

09:07.940 --> 09:11.300
And as a result, he doesn't realise

09:11.300 --> 09:14.540
when he's possibly not mucking in as much as he could do

09:14.540 --> 09:15.820
with others.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.380
A lot of the guys here are kind of like,

09:19.380 --> 09:23.420
I do hard graft, I come from this place, I don't come from that...

09:23.420 --> 09:25.460
And they're a posh voice,

09:25.460 --> 09:27.740
and the fact that they went to Eton,

09:27.740 --> 09:28.580
I think some guys here...

09:28.780 --> 09:34.300
just don't relate to him very well as the men continue to physically decline

09:34.300 --> 09:38.740
the group is becoming fractured and it's as if they're judging each other not

09:38.740 --> 09:43.940
only on their ability to contribute and find food but also in class prejudices

09:43.940 --> 09:52.420
and that's coming to the fore an hour before nightfall a tropical storm hits

09:52.420 --> 10:00.220
the island it's gonna rain it's coming in guys it's gonna rain when it rains it

10:00.220 --> 10:09.280
rains faster it's hard the men have just minutes to secure the camp before it's

10:09.280 --> 10:11.780
washed away

10:11.780 --> 10:16.540
how's the fire Sam need some dry kindling

10:17.540 --> 10:21.740
desperately need to protect the firewood

10:22.420 --> 10:40.920
it's amazing because it's pouring of rain and under those trees it sort of

10:40.920 --> 10:46.780
feels quite dark inside kind of panic don't stop don't stop and you come out

10:46.780 --> 10:51.300
here onto the beach there's an incredible sunset over there and it's

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
just glistening on the water

10:52.420 --> 10:56.920
the sun's just glistening on the water and it just feels really quite peaceful

10:56.920 --> 11:01.060
actually really quite peaceful moment split some bamboo and we can make a

11:01.060 --> 11:07.060
drain pipe to carry it down to the beach heavens absolutely opened enough to

11:07.060 --> 11:14.800
wash out the entire camp all hands to the deck there are certain times when

11:14.800 --> 11:19.420
some people need to pull their finger out and start working

11:19.420 --> 11:21.420
Oh

11:22.420 --> 11:28.420
I have had some monster fucking bogeys off this island bogeys monsters yeah that

11:28.420 --> 11:32.380
must be one of the biggest bogeys I've ever had in my life eat it no calories

11:32.380 --> 11:37.300
you dirty bastard I mean you're quite welcome to it fella if you want it I'm

11:37.300 --> 11:43.180
absolutely fine thanks Vic I'm not that hungry yet mate very tasty after last night's

11:43.180 --> 11:48.420
vicious storm the men's shelter is in urgent need of repair

11:48.420 --> 11:50.420
I feel like a shire horse

11:50.420 --> 11:51.420
I feel like a shire horse

11:52.420 --> 11:57.800
I see that might work yeah that one never changes peers Dan and Sam Farmer

11:57.800 --> 12:01.860
have been assigned the job of weaving new palms for the roof that's looks

12:01.860 --> 12:06.100
pretty good that's not right it's not you're bending in the wrong way to start

12:06.100 --> 12:11.260
with but Sam's struggling

12:13.660 --> 12:21.160
I'm working now yes sir I don't know abandon my duty but I'm I'm actually

12:21.160 --> 12:22.420
really crap at this weaving I don't want to abandon my duty but I'm actually really crap at this weaving

12:22.420 --> 12:26.680
no one's good at it everyone shitters each other I can't actually get to work

12:26.680 --> 12:30.560
though I spent 45 minutes pat it and I'm obviously doing something wrong you need

12:30.560 --> 12:33.760
a lot more determination Sam just crack on with it just stay with it I've got to

12:33.760 --> 12:36.660
pay to my strengths and one of my strengths isn't plastic

12:36.660 --> 12:40.200
better fucking stick with it

12:40.520 --> 12:48.420
we need to sort it out demand the fuck up anyone fishing now it's too rough

12:48.420 --> 12:50.420
Sam Farmer is...

12:50.420 --> 12:52.420
Sam Farmer is...

12:52.420 --> 12:58.320
shirking some of the harder tasks and it's been noticed by a lot of members of

12:58.320 --> 13:00.600
the group

13:02.300 --> 13:06.500
I think some people in this group were working harder than others I don't want

13:06.500 --> 13:12.620
to point any fingers but Sam I do have a bit of an issue with Sam Farmer at the

13:12.620 --> 13:17.340
minute yeah he's getting under my skin just seems to potter about the place as

13:17.340 --> 13:22.280
if he's looking for his butler sensing the group is starting to turn

13:22.420 --> 13:29.560
against him Sam decides to approach one of his critics I hate tension and when

13:29.560 --> 13:33.820
you can feel that someone's not quite at ease with you I think it's worth

13:33.820 --> 13:36.420
nipping things in the bud early

13:36.420 --> 13:38.420
Sam can I have a quick word?

13:38.420 --> 13:41.420
I feel that you're a bit frustrated with me and I don't want to make a big deal out of it

13:41.420 --> 13:43.420
a little bit man I am

13:43.420 --> 13:45.420
can we talk about it later? I'm busy

13:45.420 --> 13:46.420
actually...

13:46.420 --> 13:50.300
Sam let's talk about it later okay? I'm working well there'll be plenty of time okay?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.300
I'd rather talk it out now because it's in the air

13:52.420 --> 13:54.420
and quite a few people mention it to me

13:54.420 --> 13:56.420
Sam not now okay?

13:56.420 --> 14:00.420
not now please let me finish this later on when we're having some food

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
five minutes?

14:01.420 --> 14:05.420
no let me get this tree down and maybe okay?

14:05.420 --> 14:07.420
not highly successful

14:09.420 --> 14:11.420
never mind he's not happy

14:13.420 --> 14:18.420
people are having a bit of a go at Sam Farmer and I'm finding it a bit mean really

14:18.420 --> 14:21.420
Sam works really really hard but he works really hard on his own

14:22.420 --> 14:27.420
and a lot of the things he wants to do he's getting a bit sidetracked in that regard

14:34.420 --> 14:38.420
determined to stop the rift between Sam and the group getting any worse

14:38.420 --> 14:41.420
Will takes him aside for a chat

14:42.420 --> 14:45.420
I definitely think I'm putting my weight

14:45.420 --> 14:49.420
but I think it could be perceived that you're doing the things that you want to do

14:49.420 --> 14:51.420
I honestly don't mind what I do

14:51.420 --> 14:53.420
and I know that I can see that

14:53.420 --> 14:56.420
but if you're doing it on your own and no one's noticing

14:56.420 --> 14:59.420
it doesn't get any kudos at all

14:59.420 --> 15:01.420
how bad is the gossip you think?

15:01.420 --> 15:03.420
quite bad

15:03.420 --> 15:05.420
if I'm honest everyone's

15:07.420 --> 15:10.420
it's yeah I mean that's why we're having this conversation

15:13.420 --> 15:15.420
thanks Will thanks very much

15:17.420 --> 15:19.420
the last few days have been quite frustrating

15:19.420 --> 15:21.420
quite a bit of gunning down

15:21.420 --> 15:24.420
I gossip you know what's Sam up to or what's he doing

15:24.420 --> 15:27.420
and it's really hard it's really frustrating

15:27.420 --> 15:33.420
because I really believe I genuinely believe that I'm working as hard as anyone else

15:33.420 --> 15:37.420
and I'm giving my all and I'm putting my back into this

15:43.420 --> 15:47.420
wanting to explain himself to the group Sam calls a meeting

15:47.420 --> 15:50.420
I've actually found the last three weeks quite hard

15:50.420 --> 15:54.420
I found the physical exhaustion that comes with a lack of food

15:54.420 --> 15:58.420
really hard really really really hard

15:58.420 --> 16:01.420
and I wanted to say thank you really first of all

16:01.420 --> 16:05.420
to all you guys for being so amazing

16:05.420 --> 16:08.420
and also for bearing with me

16:08.420 --> 16:12.420
I haven't sort of almost been myself actually as much as I wanted to be myself

16:16.420 --> 16:19.420
back in the big smoke I dare say that bloke's king of the hill

16:19.420 --> 16:22.420
no two ways about it how he talks walks and conducts himself

16:22.420 --> 16:25.420
a great mind's fantastic but we don't need great minds here

16:25.420 --> 16:28.420
we're cavemen we need to sweat blood and guts

16:28.420 --> 16:32.420
and if you're not then it stands out like a blind cobbler's thumb don't it

16:34.420 --> 16:36.420
determined to prove his worth to the others

16:36.420 --> 16:40.420
Sam has decided to resurrect the group's old fishing nets

16:40.420 --> 16:42.420
we have not put one fish in the net yet

16:42.420 --> 16:46.420
if we can get these nets out I feel that the sea is our larder

16:46.420 --> 16:50.420
but having failed with a net several times already

16:50.420 --> 16:53.420
the others aren't convinced by Sam's latest idea

16:55.420 --> 16:59.420
these fucking nets waste more energy than anything else

16:59.420 --> 17:03.420
the amount of calories and energy people have expended with no return

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
is unbelievable

17:06.420 --> 17:08.420
I mean it's just nuts

17:13.420 --> 17:15.420
with heavy weights and floats to get into position

17:17.420 --> 17:21.420
Sam's enlisted the help of Barney to set the nets

17:21.420 --> 17:23.420
Barney I'm smacked here

17:23.420 --> 17:24.420
fuck

17:26.420 --> 17:28.420
because there are a lot of rocks around here

17:29.420 --> 17:32.420
dragging heavy fishing nets out to sea fighting the currents

17:32.420 --> 17:35.420
is going to burn through hundreds and hundreds of calories

17:37.420 --> 17:39.420
with so little energy in their body

17:39.420 --> 17:42.420
for them it's going to probably feel like swimming through treacle

17:43.420 --> 17:44.420
ok ready

17:44.420 --> 17:45.420
one two three

17:46.420 --> 17:47.260
go

17:50.420 --> 17:52.420
gosh that was exhausting

17:52.420 --> 17:54.420
exhausting

17:55.420 --> 17:57.420
after treading water for over an hour

17:57.420 --> 18:00.420
Sam and Barney can finally head back to dry land

18:05.420 --> 18:06.420
how you going lads

18:06.420 --> 18:07.420
where you got chaps

18:07.420 --> 18:09.420
absolutely knackered

18:10.420 --> 18:12.420
it was absolutely just shattering

18:12.420 --> 18:14.420
we really really need to have

18:14.420 --> 18:16.420
five minutes or ten minutes of rest

18:16.420 --> 18:26.520
lie down do I've got some fish for you there he is the islands top fisherman

18:26.520 --> 18:31.240
Vic is returning to camp after another successful outing with his line and pole

18:31.240 --> 18:41.200
oh god damn boys about three in a puffer I have oh my god you hear it born and

18:41.200 --> 18:46.840
bread kid man's a hero back right here champ is that okay with you sir yeah

18:46.840 --> 18:54.160
lovely it's leaving there cuz the kaboom that's what we're having yeah can I take

18:54.160 --> 18:59.740
these horrible fish off my exceptionally good fishing pole yes to come on that

18:59.740 --> 19:05.980
thank you oh dear me nice feeling I have to know you're gonna actually feel some

19:05.980 --> 19:10.540
food in your belly I was the old Nescau tiger

19:11.200 --> 19:19.240
there's not a great deal to go round of the four fish Vic caught one is a

19:19.240 --> 19:23.960
poisonous puffer fish leaving only three to share for lunch between eleven

19:23.960 --> 19:37.580
ravenous men it's not gonna feed the 5,000 Sam is convinced his nets are the

19:37.580 --> 19:40.240
group's best chance of breaking the famine

19:40.240 --> 19:41.140
but it's not the end of the world

19:41.140 --> 19:41.180
but it's not the end of the world

19:41.180 --> 19:47.500
he can't man them alone I actually came out here to grab Barney for the net

19:47.500 --> 19:51.740
there's wood to be got and it's not fair to leave two or three lads doing it

19:51.740 --> 19:57.580
but I thought it was a 20-minute job what made you think that have you done a

19:57.580 --> 20:02.960
full day on wood yet no that's why you think it's 20 minute job I know I think

20:02.960 --> 20:07.340
you've done I think you have rolled them nets up out there and just go for a swim

20:07.340 --> 20:11.160
every day listen this is what happened right when we get back we forgot about all these fish

20:11.180 --> 20:11.760
surfs and we forgot about all these fish

20:11.760 --> 20:16.240
institutional charges all this talk about thethey hate us and all this shit

20:16.240 --> 20:21.340
people say to me what do you do and I'll say every day I sweat it as hard as I

20:21.340 --> 20:24.640
could and I was just helpful as I could and they'll say Sam what are you doing

20:24.640 --> 20:29.160
said it was a nightmare I had to swim every day for some fish

20:29.160 --> 20:35.080
that were never thereمن't not clean never there my heart bleeds for you sound

20:35.080 --> 20:40.280
yeah mine to bleeds you wait till we get the Teng sting-ray no palate you'll be

20:40.280 --> 20:41.020
passion the other fur flies Moira ederim Turkey ship South Divide done it goes to estud mosque from I'll inhale air and sold undergraduate beat and you brains down years old!

20:41.180 --> 20:44.060
Down south will work every inch of blood out of us.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.620
I thought you were joking. And you'll smile when you do it.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.260
There you go. Yeah, go for it, Sam.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.100
Finish that baby off. I'll film you, you do it.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.140
Yeah, I'd love to.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.940
Man's not got a day's graft in him.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.660
Not a fricking day's graft in him.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.820
I shouldn't be hard on the bloke, because if you've never done it,

21:00.860 --> 21:04.620
if you've had your ass wiped all your life, then so be it, you have.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.980
Yeah.

21:06.020 --> 21:10.060
I think Vic has made a judgement about me that, you know,

21:10.060 --> 21:11.540
life's been incredibly easy.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.900
And life has been easy in one sense.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.380
I've had, you know, an incredible upbringing.

21:16.420 --> 21:20.460
I've no embarrassment about the background I've come from

21:20.500 --> 21:24.420
or the family I have or the school I went to

21:24.460 --> 21:27.700
or the places I've been.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.340
They are a huge blessing.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.580
Oh, yeah. That's disgusting.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.980
After just a few mouthfuls of fish for lunch,

21:43.020 --> 21:46.100
tonight's dinner is looking even more bleak.

21:46.140 --> 21:47.820
Limpets.

21:47.860 --> 21:50.140
There is probably 15 each, you'll be pleased to know.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.340
You can all fucking eat your 15 as well.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.380
That's fucking horrible.

21:58.420 --> 22:01.740
We're eating barely enough to survive.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.820
We really need a haul of something,

22:03.860 --> 22:07.580
a big catch to come in or an animal to catch.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.620
It's so sapping here.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.540
And I'm not quite sure how long we can struggle on for

22:12.580 --> 22:13.860
without a decent feed.

22:16.380 --> 22:18.540
Not too much pressure, but if you don't get any food,

22:18.580 --> 22:20.660
we're fucked, yeah, boys? So, yeah, thanks.

22:22.540 --> 22:27.340
Now released from wood duty, Sam sets off to check his nets.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.180
I'm feeling positive.

22:29.220 --> 22:33.820
Despite the group's hostility, Sam's convinced his nets will work.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.380
I refuse pessimism to seep in.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.460
Absolute refusal.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.380
Optimism it is, then. Optimism it is.

22:39.620 --> 22:47.900
Sam knows that a big fish haul can mean not only salvation for the group,

22:47.940 --> 22:50.380
but would also restore his reputation.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.740
It's quite a long way out, isn't it? Yeah, it is.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.620
Argh!

23:15.020 --> 23:16.100
Nothing.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.620
Oh, it's just what I want to hear.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.380
It's just so depressing.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.740
It's done so much work.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.740
Oh...

23:27.780 --> 23:29.100
Very predictable.

23:29.140 --> 23:33.060
It's a waste of energy, time, fuel, everything.

23:33.100 --> 23:36.140
Stop fannying around and start doing something worthwhile.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.460
Morning!

23:39.460 --> 23:44.660
And what a beautiful marina it is.

23:44.660 --> 23:48.800
After a month on the island, the exhausted men are doing their best to share the most

23:48.800 --> 23:50.700
arduous daily chores between them.

23:50.700 --> 23:56.980
If you keep walking to the kitchen, you're going to find the water, it's almost there.

23:56.980 --> 24:03.500
But yesterday, Sam angered the group by prioritising his fishing nets over firewood.

24:03.500 --> 24:10.580
Sam checked nets, which brought absolutely diddly squads, I'm afraid to say, a big fat

24:10.580 --> 24:11.580
nothing.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.860
So there's a bit of tension between the rest of us.

24:14.860 --> 24:17.860
Pretty good.

24:17.860 --> 24:22.260
OK, let's start off the day.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.260
Who's doing what this war is?

24:24.260 --> 24:25.740
Yeah, I'm doing fishing net.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.740
I know it's a bit selfish.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.880
No, just get stuck into wood.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.880
Don't make it a token effort.

24:31.880 --> 24:32.880
Get stuck into wood.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.380
We need wood.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
Lots of it.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
The nets aren't delivering jack shit.

24:36.500 --> 24:40.500
We're pissing in the wind with them.

24:40.500 --> 24:47.620
I do feel put upon, actually, a little bit this morning, just by the comments.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.700
It's just maddening.

24:48.700 --> 24:53.180
It's absolutely maddening to be criticised and to be put down.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
It's really, really hard.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.180
And I had to be biting my tongue.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.180
Let's make a bow, actually.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.180
Do you want to talk to them?

24:57.180 --> 25:02.880
Yeah, I might have a chat with them.

25:02.880 --> 25:09.880
After days of criticism, Sam is determined to get to the bottom of Vic's hostility.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Vic?

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
Yeah?

25:11.880 --> 25:12.880
Do you trust me?

25:12.880 --> 25:13.880
I would never trust a stranger.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.880
Am I a stranger?

25:14.880 --> 25:15.880
At first, you were.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.880
OK.

25:16.880 --> 25:21.880
It's taken me longer to get used to you than it has any of the other guys, because they

25:21.880 --> 25:22.880
sound a little bit like me.

25:22.880 --> 25:27.880
You're the first person I've ever met that actually speaks like this.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.880
Am I suffering your prejudice because of a bad experience?

25:30.880 --> 25:31.880
From where I come from?

25:31.880 --> 25:32.880
From where I come from?

25:32.880 --> 25:33.880
Yeah.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.880
We vote one, three, four years on a government, yeah?

25:35.880 --> 25:36.880
Yeah.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.880
And the person we vote for speaks like you.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.880
And we put every last vestige of trust in that person.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.880
And then you dick us every single time.

25:45.880 --> 25:50.880
I have more respect for a man who will break through my front door and steal my telly when

25:50.880 --> 25:55.880
I'm on holiday than I do that man that tells me on, that does this and don't point because

25:55.880 --> 25:59.880
it's rude and emphasises with his hands, and he's got a great speaking voice and Boris

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
and all that sort of shit.

26:00.880 --> 26:05.880
I have no respect whatsoever because they are thieving, lying, clever people with affluence

26:05.880 --> 26:08.880
and money and a good voice and a fantastic education.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.880
Vic, you're basically saying you're all the same.

26:11.880 --> 26:12.880
That's what you're basically saying.

26:12.880 --> 26:17.880
But yes, which is perhaps lack of education, lack of understanding, lack of experience.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.880
Which is because I'm trapped in a working class life.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.880
People with power and influence, they just abuse the little man every time.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.880
Do you assume I do have power and influence?

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
I mean, it's little old me.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.880
It's little old me.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.880
But it's difficult to get rid of all them years of listening to people with accent

26:34.880 --> 26:38.880
and class, tell you one thing and do a totally different thing because then you don't trust

26:38.880 --> 26:39.880
them at all.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.880
So unfortunately, I don't trust you.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
Yeah.

26:44.880 --> 26:45.880
Interesting.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
It was hard to hear.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.880
I hate conflict.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.880
I have a choice, either just to try and ignore it.

26:57.880 --> 27:05.880
Or I can try and embrace it and show him that actually I'm very different from those

27:05.880 --> 27:08.880
that have put him down in the past.

27:08.880 --> 27:13.880
And my hope is that he will see me by the end of this experiment.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.880
He will see me as a person who's on his side.

27:17.880 --> 27:22.880
For centuries, you know, the British have been totally class driven, almost class obsessed.

27:22.880 --> 27:27.880
And it's like a pathological disorder where people get fixated on what they're doing.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.880
Where they feel they stand in that pecking order.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.880
Are they lower, middle or upper classes?

27:32.880 --> 27:37.880
But if the men are going to survive here, they've got to put aside those prejudices

27:37.880 --> 27:38.880
and work as a team.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.880
Right, people.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.880
The fishing wheel will go.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.880
I'm away, boys.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.880
Catch some supper.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.880
Let's have some fish.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.880
We can all have a decent meal.

27:55.880 --> 27:56.880
With nothing to eat in camp.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.880
The starving men have decided to use their last reserves of energy

28:00.880 --> 28:04.880
on one big concerted effort to find food.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.880
Jesus Christ.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.880
Oh, fuck, yes.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.880
Get him.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.880
Get him.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.880
Got him, got him, got him.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.880
Fuck.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.880
OK.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.880
Oh, his tail snapped off.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.880
Didn't a bloody snake do that?

28:23.880 --> 28:25.880
Despite opposition from the rest of the group,

28:25.880 --> 28:28.880
Sam has decided to persevere with his nets.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.880
You just have to keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.880
Sometimes you fail, and sometimes you're successful.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.880
We have a first victim down there.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.880
Oh, you say then?

28:43.880 --> 28:44.880
Being the top fish catcher.

28:44.880 --> 28:45.880
Pressure's on.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.880
Yeah, the pressure is on.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.880
But I also think the mark of a man is in rising to pressure.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.880
We still haven't got anything, anything,

28:53.880 --> 28:57.880
anything, anything.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.880
Desperately, desperately need food.

29:00.880 --> 29:06.880
After five exhausting hours, the men have found nothing for dinner.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
Jesus Christ, look at the fucking...

29:08.880 --> 29:11.880
You bastard!

29:11.880 --> 29:14.880
Took the hook and the lot.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.880
That's bad.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
Fuck all.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.880
Even the island's top fisherman, Vic, has had to admit defeat.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
Son of a bitch.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.880
I'm gutted.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.880
I really wanted to bring in a nice haul for guys tonight to eat,

29:27.880 --> 29:29.880
do you know what I mean?

29:29.880 --> 29:30.880
Fuck!

29:33.880 --> 29:36.880
Exhausted, starving hungry and despondent,

29:36.880 --> 29:38.880
the men gather back in camp.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.880
So what's the plan, guys?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.880
Try not to slash my wrist.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.880
Without a single scrap of food to show for a day's hunting,

29:45.880 --> 29:47.880
the group are out of options.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.880
Save one unlikely potential saviour.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.880
What would you feel about all of us getting the net in today?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.880
Let's say after this meeting, we all troop down there.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.880
I mean, I'm being a bit hopeful.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
How do we empty the nets?

30:04.880 --> 30:05.880
You've got to bring them in.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.880
Going to have to pull them in.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.880
Ooh, fuck it, I'll fight.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.880
I think it'd be quite good if we could pull together

30:11.880 --> 30:13.880
and get these things done.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
Yeah, fuck it, count me in.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.880
Two crack on?

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
Fair enough.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
Yes, I'll come in the water and pull a net, yeah?

30:20.880 --> 30:21.880
Brilliant. Brilliant.

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
Sounds good to me.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
Yeah. Yeah?

30:23.880 --> 30:24.880
Sounds good.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.880
Ready to go?

30:25.880 --> 30:26.880
Go.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.880
Come on, boys.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
Bring home the bacon.

30:30.880 --> 30:31.880
Bring home the fish.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.880
That's some fishies.

30:33.880 --> 30:38.880
In desperation, the men agree to give Sam's nets a final chance.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.880
If you don't give up, I'll give him that blessing.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.880
But they are now making a dangerous gamble

30:43.880 --> 30:45.880
with their last reserves of energy.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.880
Please be fishing this net.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.880
OK, are you ready?

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
Ready, ready.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
One, two...

31:03.880 --> 31:05.880
Yes!

31:07.880 --> 31:08.880
Nowhere!

31:09.880 --> 31:12.880
There's a lot of whooping coming from those nets, people.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.880
Where do you go, lads?

31:17.880 --> 31:18.880
Fuck me.

31:18.880 --> 31:19.880
Hooray!

31:20.880 --> 31:22.680
How many do you think you've got, Sam?

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
I don't know.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.680
Jesus Christ.

31:25.680 --> 31:30.680
That's the first one, boys.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
Oh, yeah.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.680
Yeah?

31:32.680 --> 31:34.680
Oh, there's the second one, boys.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.680
And the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.680
Oh, God.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.680
I'm telling you.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.680
Look at them coming out.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.680
Yeah!

31:43.680 --> 31:44.680
Woo!

31:44.680 --> 31:45.680
Ah!

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
Look at them!

31:46.680 --> 31:48.680
Come on!

31:48.680 --> 31:49.680
Come on!

31:49.680 --> 31:50.680
Come on!

31:50.680 --> 31:51.680
Woo!

31:51.680 --> 31:52.680
Woo!

31:52.680 --> 31:53.680
Woo!

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
Yeah!

31:54.680 --> 31:55.680
Yeah!

31:55.680 --> 31:56.680
Come on!

31:56.680 --> 31:57.680
Yeah!

31:57.680 --> 31:58.680
Yeah!

31:58.680 --> 31:59.680
Yeah!

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
Yeah!

32:00.680 --> 32:01.680
Yeah!

32:01.680 --> 32:02.680
Yeah!

32:02.680 --> 32:03.680
Yeah!

32:03.680 --> 32:04.680
Yeah!

32:04.680 --> 32:05.680
Yeah!

32:05.680 --> 32:06.680
Come on!

32:06.680 --> 32:07.680
Yeah!

32:07.680 --> 32:10.680
Fucking awesome, man.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.680
Well done, man.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.680
Well done.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.680
Well done, fella.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.680
Well done.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.680
Well done, mate.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.680
Fucking excellent.

32:18.680 --> 32:19.680
I have a new family.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.680
I respect.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
I really do.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.680
That is brilliant.

32:22.680 --> 32:23.680
That was the hardest thing I've done in a long time.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.680
Fuck!

32:24.680 --> 32:25.680
A big fishy hook for the old man and the fish.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.680
Get in there, boys.

32:26.680 --> 32:27.680
Get in there.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
Thank you, Vic.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.680
Thank you.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.680
Very kind.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.680
Finally, the net's come good.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.680
And that's all Sam Farmer's doing.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.680
He's been working tirelessly to get that.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.680
I think that Sam's going to be kind of accepted as more a part of the team now.

32:34.680 --> 32:35.680
Shit, love.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.680
Shit.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.680
That looks heavy.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.680
Yeah.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
Yeah.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
Yeah.

32:40.680 --> 32:41.680
Yeah.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.680
Yeah.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
Yeah.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.680
Yeah.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.680
Yeah.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
Yeah.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
Yeah.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
Yeah.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.680
Yeah.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
That looks heavy.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.680
Okay, guys.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.680
The first fish.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
Yes.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.680
Second.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.680
Hello.

32:56.680 --> 32:57.680
Good size.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.680
Third.

32:58.680 --> 32:59.680
Second.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.680
All I wanted was just a fish.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.680
One fish.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.680
How many fishes have we got?

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
Twenty-one!

33:04.680 --> 33:05.680
Gentlemen of the net.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.680
Well done, guys.

33:06.680 --> 33:07.680
Twenty-one little fishies.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
Oh, yeah.

33:08.680 --> 33:09.680
Oh, yeah.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.680
Oh, yeah.

33:10.680 --> 33:11.680
Oh, yeah.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.680
Oh, yeah.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
Oh, yeah.

33:13.680 --> 33:14.680
Oh, yeah.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.680
Oh, yeah.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.680
Oh, yeah.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
Oh, yeah.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
Oh, yeah.

33:18.680 --> 33:27.520
remark

33:29.740 --> 33:31.680
Dishes for the dishes.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.680
Dinner is ready, boy.

33:32.680 --> 33:33.680
Nice.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.680
It just goes to show you, the reality is, in a survival situation, it's the ultimate

33:34.680 --> 33:35.680
systematic leveler, there's only one class that matters, survival class.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.420
Sam's determination has been amazing with MNets.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.780
I am really happy that you can see that.

33:41.780 --> 33:43.520
Yes, I couldn't.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
I won't deny it.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.540
I couldn't see it at all.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.680
I just thought, well, you're a big city.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.240
But the big city fan, he's done good.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.160
Sam Farmer, my heart comes off to you, sir.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.480
Well done, you, for having the balls and the determination

33:56.480 --> 33:57.920
to fix them every time,

33:57.920 --> 34:01.480
because that certainly weren't my cup of tea at all.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.160
Well done, him. Thank you.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.960
I'd just like to say a massive thanks

34:05.960 --> 34:09.440
and a raise like any other to Sam Farmer.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.080
Sam Farmer!

34:11.080 --> 34:13.520
Well done, big fella. Founder of the Fishy Feast.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.880
Here we are. Here we are.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.280
Well made at last, fella.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.680
Last night, the men had a hearty 21-fish supper,

34:22.680 --> 34:24.680
thanks to Sam Farmer's nets.

34:26.200 --> 34:29.200
But following the feast, 36-year-old Will

34:29.200 --> 34:31.680
is the only member of the group who's out of bed.

34:32.680 --> 34:34.480
It's, uh...

34:34.480 --> 34:36.560
Up past eight, no-one's awake.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.960
They're gonna make a lot of noise.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.280
It's up past eight.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.920
Sun's been up for two and a half hours.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.920
Normally, I'd finish our morning meeting by now.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
So...

34:44.920 --> 34:47.360
Will's worried the men aren't making the most

34:47.360 --> 34:47.640
of the feast.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.680
They're worried about the energy they got from last night's meal.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.680
I take it we're all going up.

34:54.680 --> 34:55.680
Morning!

34:59.400 --> 35:01.680
I'm glad you woke me up, pal. I'd have slept in.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.680
Morning.

35:05.680 --> 35:09.680
This is a complete one-off, unique opportunity.

35:11.680 --> 35:16.680
I want to wring out every last possible experience out of it.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.680
I think we need a general camp wake-up call.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.680
It was half past eight and most people were still in bed.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.680
We sat round this campfire every night and said,

35:25.680 --> 35:27.680
oh, yeah, I want to go romping round the island,

35:27.680 --> 35:29.680
I want to catch a piggy, I want to get caiman,

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
I want to do traps, I want to do this, I want to do that,

35:31.680 --> 35:35.680
doing all these things, but two and a half hours of daylight's gone.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.680
You know, I think it's just a bit of a shame.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.680
Are you insisting we get up? No, I'm not insisting.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.680
I know somebody was upset this morning

35:42.680 --> 35:45.680
because it was a crescendo of boom, boom, boom, for an hour.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.480
You can bang boxes and kick and...

35:47.680 --> 35:49.680
It's all you want. We're all grown-ups.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.680
Nobody's telling me what time to get up.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.680
I know, I'm not telling you... I am finished.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.680
Nobody's telling me what time to get up. I'll get up when I'm getting up.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.680
Vic, you're making it sound like I was doing that on purpose

35:57.680 --> 35:59.680
to try and wake you up. No, not at all. Were you?

35:59.680 --> 36:01.680
No, of course not. Then why would I think that?

36:01.680 --> 36:04.680
I just laid there laughing, thinking, that's quite funny.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.680
You be making noises, you be wanting us to wake up,

36:06.680 --> 36:08.680
me wanting us to wake up at half past eight,

36:08.680 --> 36:10.680
you were banging boxes and crashing and banging,

36:10.680 --> 36:12.680
and I was laughing to myself.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.680
I'm going to stay in bed and prove a point.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.680
A bit childish.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
How old are you?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.680
11am.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.680
The men finally crack on with the day's business.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.680
We've got a fish!

36:30.680 --> 36:32.680
Having been out overnight,

36:32.680 --> 36:35.680
Sam Farmer's nets are continuing to bear fruit.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.680
There's another fish below you as well.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.680
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.680
I tell you what, we've got enough fish to eat tonight, so that's good.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.680
How was it? Awesome. Absolutely awesome.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.680
They're both grinning like Cheshire cats.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.680
It's got to be good news.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.680
The bag is full.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.680
A bit of a tiddler, sorry.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.680
Yeah!

36:55.680 --> 36:57.680
The yellowfiller bag!

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
I want tuna!

36:58.680 --> 36:59.680
I love tuna.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.680
That net's working treat for them, isn't it?

37:02.680 --> 37:04.680
Big tuna.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.680
Ooh, another different type of tuna.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
18.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
18.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.680
Right, filleting.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.680
The key is in the care of these tuna is the firmness of the flesh, see?

37:16.680 --> 37:17.680
Yeah.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.680
Yeah, see, that's gone. Sorry, boys.

37:20.680 --> 37:21.680
That is gone.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.680
The men are paying a heavy price for their late start to the day.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.680
Oh, look at that.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.680
We have wasted a lot of fish today

37:31.680 --> 37:33.680
because we have got pulleys in too late.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.680
Yeah, we don't know. A lot of fish.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.680
And this one as well.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.680
At the moment, I'm having a real problem with fish getting caught in the net

37:40.680 --> 37:41.680
going rotten.

37:41.680 --> 37:45.680
You put the nets overnight, the fish could have been caught at one in the morning,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.680
they could have been caught at 11 last night.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.680
All of a sudden, you get to 10 o'clock this morning,

37:49.680 --> 37:53.680
you've been sat in a net for 12 hours going off.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.680
It's 11 o'clock and we've only just pulled the fish in.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.680
I think we need to get out of bed.

37:58.680 --> 37:59.680
Faster.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.680
Get out of bed earlier, yeah.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.680
I think we'll just have a morning call.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.680
Go, right, 7.30, everyone up.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.680
I don't want to waste any more fish

38:07.680 --> 38:08.680
because we can't be bothered getting out of bed

38:08.680 --> 38:10.680
and now checking the nets.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.680
Once again,

38:14.680 --> 38:17.680
the group's food situation looks bleak.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.680
You need to head around this bit.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.680
With no food in camp, fishing with a rod and line

38:22.680 --> 38:25.680
is now the men's best hope of catching something for dinner.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.680
Don't be too long, mate. We've got a long way back, yeah?

38:28.680 --> 38:31.680
Will is an incredible man for his energy

38:31.680 --> 38:35.680
and his ability to keep not just motivated

38:35.680 --> 38:39.680
but to keep the enthusiasm to follow his ideas through

38:39.680 --> 38:42.680
when he's running on empty just like the rest of us.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.680
It's really quite impressive.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.680
I'm going to head around, OK?

38:49.680 --> 38:51.680
To get to the best fishing spot,

38:51.680 --> 38:54.680
they must navigate the island's treacherous coastline

38:54.680 --> 38:56.680
at high tide.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.680
I think one of the most critical skills in survival generally

39:01.680 --> 39:05.680
is just awareness, you know, an ability to kind of assess

39:05.680 --> 39:08.680
and just take your time and think through things

39:08.680 --> 39:09.680
before you actually act.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.680
But here's the danger.

39:13.680 --> 39:17.680
The more malnourished, the more their judgement gets impaired

39:17.680 --> 39:19.680
and that's when they can end up taking risks

39:19.680 --> 39:21.680
that can put their lives in jeopardy.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.680
Your house is looking a bit tasty down there, isn't it?

39:28.680 --> 39:31.680
Stop, mate. Stop.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.680
Have we left it a bit late?

39:33.680 --> 39:36.680
Right, boys, this is where it's going to get naughty.

39:36.680 --> 39:40.680
Whoo! It's like that big diving board in Sheffield Arena.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
Too high.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
Too high.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.680
What's happening, mate?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.680
We've got some big ones coming, so let's wait.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.680
The idea is to watch them coming in,

39:50.680 --> 39:52.680
wait for a flat spot and go for it.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.680
Hold!

39:55.680 --> 39:56.680
Hold!

39:59.680 --> 40:00.680
There he's gone!

40:01.680 --> 40:02.680
Back!

40:04.680 --> 40:05.680
Oh, shit!

40:07.680 --> 40:08.680
There!

40:08.680 --> 40:09.680
Whoo-hoo!

40:09.680 --> 40:13.680
Right, step, step, hand, yeah?

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
Well done.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
Next!

40:20.680 --> 40:21.680
One pierce.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.680
Now pierce. Push off.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.680
Push off, push off, push off.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
Hand, hand, hand.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.680
There we go. Bingo, Stella.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.680
Whoo! Big whirl!

40:30.680 --> 40:32.680
Well, if I were you, I'd come a bit further along.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.680
Camera.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.680
I can go all the way around.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.680
There's no hole. There's no hole.

40:36.680 --> 40:37.680
You can't get all the way around.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
Wrong incline.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.680
Vic, I'll not be able to make this with the camera.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.680
That's OK. I'm just ready for you coming along.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.680
Vic, go across, yeah?

40:44.680 --> 40:45.680
Steady away.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.680
That's fine. Easy to do that.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.680
You all right?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.680
Yep.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
Fucking Jesus.

40:54.680 --> 40:55.680
Be careful!

40:56.680 --> 40:57.680
Turn around, face the rocks.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.680
Yeah, check for loose rocks.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.680
Right, aim for the hand, aim for the hand.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.680
Keep hold, keep hold, keep hold.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.680
There you go, there you go, there you go.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.680
Holy shit!

41:17.680 --> 41:18.680
You OK? You OK?

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
OK.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.680
OK, just come up.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.680
Get the fucking camera off!

41:21.680 --> 41:22.680
I'm sorry.

41:22.680 --> 41:23.680
Get the fucking camera off.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.680
I'm sorry.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.680
Stay still. Stay still.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.680
Are you OK?

41:27.680 --> 41:28.680
Give me a, give me a...

41:30.680 --> 41:32.680
Let's get off the danger area and then assess the catch,

41:32.680 --> 41:33.680
OK?

41:34.680 --> 41:35.680
OK, that's nasty.

41:35.680 --> 41:42.680
Will is losing blood and is in a state of shock.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.680
Let's move on before we get stuck again, OK?

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
Yep.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.680
Dr Pearce needs to get him back to camp urgently

41:50.680 --> 41:52.680
so he can examine the injury properly.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.680
Son of a bitch.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.680
I tell you what, that was a massive fall.

42:00.680 --> 42:01.680
Totally unexpected.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.680
To see that cut was pretty scary.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.680
We'll get your blood done.

42:06.680 --> 42:07.680
Yeah.

42:07.680 --> 42:08.680
OK.

42:08.680 --> 42:09.680
Will.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.680
Will.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.680
Dude.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.680
It's actually quite serious.

42:12.680 --> 42:13.680
Nice house.

42:13.680 --> 42:14.680
Oh, shit.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.680
Dr Pearce can finally make a proper assessment.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.680
What is that you can see underneath it?

42:18.680 --> 42:21.680
Is that muscle or is that bone?

42:21.680 --> 42:25.680
I think he's severed one of his tendons.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.680
It's bad.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.680
I mean,

42:27.680 --> 42:30.680
I wouldn't be happy just to patch that up here.

42:30.680 --> 42:31.680
No, I wouldn't either.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.680
No.

42:32.680 --> 42:33.680
Oh.

42:33.680 --> 42:34.680
No.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.640
is to patch that up here.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.880
That needs a surgical exploration in an operating theatre.

42:46.680 --> 42:50.320
If I have to go, I'm really devastated.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.880
And at the end of the day, Will,

42:56.880 --> 43:00.720
remember you're right-handed, it's your livelihood,

43:00.720 --> 43:04.720
and we've got to be sensible and realistic.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.800
Fuck. Not good at all, this.

43:11.600 --> 43:12.880
OK, guys.

43:15.680 --> 43:19.360
Just give me a minute, yeah? Give me a minute, lads.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.960
He's such a valued part of our team.

43:26.960 --> 43:30.240
If he leaves, I would totally feel gutted.

43:30.240 --> 43:30.680
So I'm dead.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.960
I'm really desperate for him to stay with us.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.640
Knowing Will's injury is serious,

43:37.640 --> 43:41.960
Dr Pearce has no option but to call the emergency paramedic team

43:41.960 --> 43:43.320
for a second opinion.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.400
Do you think he's gone off your arms?

43:45.400 --> 43:46.920
I do, yeah.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.800
I want him to go, in fact.

43:48.800 --> 43:53.280
It's something that can't be dealt with on the island, OK?

43:53.280 --> 43:54.880
You need a surgeon that's trained,

43:54.880 --> 43:57.320
you need a sterile operating theatre.

43:57.320 --> 43:58.600
It's real no-braining.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.360
He's gone quite deep.

44:02.360 --> 44:03.840
Is it Gors there? OK.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.400
Injury is muscular and not just superficial,

44:10.400 --> 44:11.840
so he needs to be evacuated.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.000
OK, hold on.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.400
ASAP, Ella.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.240
Get your stuff together, OK?

44:16.240 --> 44:17.480
All right, fantastic.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.040
Keep those for me, guys.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.840
After five weeks on the island, Will's time is over.

44:26.840 --> 44:30.000
Smallest things, and it's just a simple fall like that,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.200
and it's cut my experience off.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.960
Oh, mate, I'm so fucking sorry.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.440
You've been a fucking hero, mate, you really have.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.360
Guys, we need to go right now.

44:49.360 --> 44:50.920
I don't care what anyone says,

44:50.920 --> 44:52.960
we've effectively had a leader out here,

44:52.960 --> 44:54.480
and it's been Will's best effort.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.000
He's done it. He's done it.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.760
It's been Will's best effort here, and it's been Will's.

44:58.760 --> 45:02.840
He's led by example, he's led by inspiration.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.800
Thank you, buddy.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.480
When people can't be asked or don't want to do something,

45:07.480 --> 45:11.080
he's done it himself, and he's filmed the whole thing as well.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.960
The man-spinning machine.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.280
I think we'll regress to kind of ape men.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.320
Will now, he's gone.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.640
See you soon, Will!

45:23.400 --> 45:25.720
Oh, he's got a sub on, hasn't he? Bless him.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.600
Yeah, I think he's upset.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.600
See you soon!

45:31.600 --> 45:33.400
Good luck, Will. Good luck.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.120
All right, fella? Yeah.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.280
Yeah? No, listen, it's how it works.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.080
You did your best, that's how it works.

45:44.880 --> 45:49.680
I never imagined that I'd be so gutted,

45:49.680 --> 45:53.880
so disappointed, so kind of upset with one of us leaving.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.200
Especially in the last few days, I've gotten with him so well,

45:59.200 --> 46:01.200
and I've really made a really good friend of him.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.840
Next time, on the final instalment of The Women's Island...

46:09.840 --> 46:12.680
No supper for us tonight.

46:12.680 --> 46:13.920
I'm starved.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.320
You're doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah. What?!

46:16.320 --> 46:18.840
We are completely dysfunctional as a group.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.040
We need leadership.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.800
Well, you're not here for the team any more.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.840
Are you trying to start an argument? I'm asking that for you.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
You are trying to start an argument. Do you know what?

46:25.840 --> 46:28.040
Jamie, you're a fucking fag.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.440
We're going to end up killing each other by the end of this.

46:55.840 --> 47:01.400
It's going to get really bad.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.720
I'm telling you, I can't get over it.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.080
It's about onions, not onions.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.000
I know the onions.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.640
Theyrada was dead, she's dead, but she's alive.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.000
Well, I don't have a lot of diamonds.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.760
Next time on, you know, thoroughly ousted children?

47:13.760 --> 47:15.200
That's right, I'm going to end up with them all.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.640
You don't know what it's gonna be like.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.840
him des bic cam reported he will quietly leave the gym.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.640
He is ollut since the beginning.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.880
That's a shame.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.440
What do you mean?

47:24.440 --> 47:25.640
What?
