00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Two uninhabited Pacific Islands, more than 5,000 miles from the UK.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.280
One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British

00:20.280 --> 00:21.280
women.

00:21.280 --> 00:30.120
When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power or mental strength

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
that wins the day?

00:31.120 --> 00:35.280
Who will have what it takes to stay alive?

00:35.280 --> 00:44.000
Tonight, we follow the women.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.400
In 21st century Britain, old-fashioned ideas about men and women have disappeared, and

00:50.400 --> 00:51.260
traditional gender roles have disappeared.

00:51.260 --> 00:58.260
Women are often expected to do it all, combining childcare with excelling at work.

00:58.260 --> 01:02.120
Don't let that happen again, I don't know who's doing it, it's really, really embarrassing

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
and unprofessional.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.080
But if stripped of all of the advantages of modern life, are multitasking 21st century

01:08.080 --> 01:12.600
women better cut out for survival than men?

01:12.600 --> 01:19.000
To find out, I'm abandoning 14 ordinary women to fend for themselves on a remote desert

01:19.000 --> 01:19.500
island.

01:21.260 --> 01:33.120
They will be utterly alone.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
Filming everything themselves.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.120
Right, you're filming me, filming you.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.120
That is the biggest shark I've ever seen.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.120
They'll have to hunt for food...

01:43.120 --> 01:45.120
You're all right, you are.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.120
..for water...

01:46.120 --> 01:48.120
Yeah, it's collecting water now.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.120
..and for shelter.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.120
Oh, for f***'s sake.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.120
The women will be taken to the very edge of existence...

01:58.120 --> 01:59.120
Ah!

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
..living on the island for six weeks

02:01.120 --> 02:03.120
in the middle of tropical storm season.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
It's like a tornado.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
That is terrifying.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.120
We need a radio and medic now.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.120
It's not a programme, it's just f***ing ridiculous.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.120
Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?

02:20.120 --> 02:22.120
And leave it there.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.120
When pitted against the extremes of nature...

02:26.120 --> 02:30.120
..have these Monday women got what it takes to survive.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.120
Guys!

02:33.120 --> 02:35.120
That is a big f***.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.120
People hold a lot of their self-worth in things like money,

02:49.120 --> 02:51.120
what they're able to buy, what car they have,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.120
what clothes they have, make-up, how beautiful they are.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.120
When all of that's gone on the island,

02:56.120 --> 02:59.120
I think it all comes down to what sort of a person you are.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.120
I think you can be slightly different.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.120
You can be slightly mental to want to do this, right?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.120
I think you've got to be slightly off your tree.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.120
As human beings, it's the closest we're going to come to a reboot.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.120
I'm about to abandon 14 British women

03:11.120 --> 03:14.120
on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.120
I want my daughter to know that her mum is actually quite brave

03:18.120 --> 03:22.120
and she's not just this person that's there to make tea.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.120
I want to show her that you can do anything.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.120
I'm really looking forward to going back to the hunter-gatherer,

03:29.120 --> 03:30.120
our animalistic roots,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.120
and finding your own food.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.120
I think it's only by pushing yourself to these extremes

03:35.120 --> 03:38.120
that you get to find out who you truly are.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.120
These are ordinary women

03:40.120 --> 03:43.120
with no previous experience of surviving in the wild.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.120
I'm not going on because I can kill an animal

03:46.120 --> 03:48.120
and I know I can survive and I can chop down trees.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.120
I'm doing this because I can't.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.120
But I'm eager to see if I can.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.120
It's the adventure.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.120
There's so much I haven't seen.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.120
There's so much I haven't done.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.120
I'm running out of time.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.120
And I might be running out of health.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.120
How fast are we going right now?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.120
About 30 knots.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.120
We can go really fast if you want.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.120
I think people often think that to be good at adventure or survival,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.120
you've got to have big muscles.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.120
But actually, in the battle to stay alive,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.120
it's one in here and in here, not on these.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.120
Currently on the island,

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
all of us girls,

04:28.120 --> 04:31.120
I think we will not only survive,

04:31.120 --> 04:32.120
but I think we'll thrive.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.120
This is your island.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
Straight ahead.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.120
There's no beach!

04:46.120 --> 04:49.120
There are a lot of currents around this, OK?

04:49.120 --> 04:52.120
So I'm going to try and find little areas of slack water

04:52.120 --> 04:53.120
to get you in.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
Unpredictable riptides and hidden rocks

04:57.120 --> 04:59.120
make these waters treacherous.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.120
This is the closest I can get the boat to the shoreline.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.120
I'm not going to sugarcoat this for you guys.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.120
It is going to be hard.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.120
It's going to be hard physically.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.120
It's going to be hard emotionally.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.120
And the thing to remember is positivity,

05:15.120 --> 05:18.120
positivity, positivity.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.120
It's not the white beaches and the sun that we were daydreaming of.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.120
I was OK until I got to this point,

05:25.120 --> 05:28.120
and now I'm really panicking.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Hey!

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
How deep is that?

05:31.120 --> 05:33.120
You know, it is going to be out of your depth.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.120
There are rocks in there.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
Just be smart.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.120
To get to the island,

05:37.120 --> 05:39.120
the women have no choice but to swim to the shore

05:39.120 --> 05:41.120
in the clothes they're wearing.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
It's the thought of being all night

05:44.120 --> 05:47.120
with no dry clothes and no fire,

05:47.120 --> 05:49.120
cos we have to make mistakes.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
Don't think about it.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.120
Don't think about it.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
Just one by one.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.120
It's going to take hours.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.120
We'll just cuddle each other tonight.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
Yeah.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
Everyone's allowed the old wind.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
Once we get you in the water,

05:59.120 --> 06:00.120
you'll be done with it.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.120
Yeah.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
Yeah?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
Then it's all in front of you.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.120
It's all uphill from here.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.120
You'll be great.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.120
You'll be great.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.120
It's all uphill from here.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
Yeah.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
You're good to go.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.120
Let's go for it.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.120
The women take with them bags and cases

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
containing their filming equipment

06:23.120 --> 06:25.120
and medical supplies.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.120
This is croc territory.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.120
Let's get you out of the water as fast as we can.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.120
OK, let's go.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.120
From this moment on, they'll be completely alone.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.120
Who are you?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.120
George.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.120
George. Excellent.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
Becky.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.120
Becky. Hi, Becky.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.120
Happy.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
Ah!

06:53.120 --> 06:54.120
It's so nice to meet you.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.120
I'm Harveller.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.120
Nice to meet you.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
What do you do?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
I'm a psychotherapist.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.120
Oh, my God!

06:59.120 --> 07:00.120
Yeah!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.120
Belinda.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.120
I'm Jamie.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.120
Jamie.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.120
Nice to meet you.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.120
What's your name?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.120
Ah, Becky.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.120
Hello.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.120
Belinda.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.120
Well, that was suitably chaotic.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
You know, it's 4 o'clock.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
It's going to get dark here in a couple of hours.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.120
And already, you know, there have been 15 minutes

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
of chat, chat, chat on the beach.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.120
They need to work hard, get moving.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.120
But, yeah.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
It's so nice to meet you.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.120
Thank you.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
Thank you.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.120
Thank you.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Thank you.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
Thank you.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
Thank you.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
But, yeah.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
There's nothing I can do.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
These are things they're going to find out.

07:26.120 --> 07:30.120
It's time for me and the crew to leave.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.120
We won't be back till the end of the experiment.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.120
Oh!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.120
I am peeing!

07:36.120 --> 07:37.120
I'm peeing!

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
I'm peeing!

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
I'm peeing!

07:39.120 --> 07:40.120
Oh!

07:40.120 --> 07:41.120
I still need to pee.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.120
I don't know if I want to pee through my trousers.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
Oh, boy.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.120
I don't know.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
Drop them.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.120
The women's home for the next six weeks

07:49.120 --> 07:52.120
is this remote, uninhabited beach.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.580
Pacific Island. To make sure they have a fighting chance of survival, I've ensured

07:57.580 --> 08:03.040
there is enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation to keep them alive. But

08:03.040 --> 08:08.440
only if they have the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it. I've dropped the

08:08.440 --> 08:13.060
group in the most inhospitable part of the island. There's unforgiving jungle and

08:13.060 --> 08:18.620
deadly creatures all around. Now just two hours before sunset, the group need to

08:18.620 --> 08:26.180
move away as quickly as they can. Are you still weeing, Jade? I'm weeing. I need to find that peaceful moment where I can actually weee.

08:26.180 --> 08:32.020
The thing is I'm weeing. And then I push more and I'm weeing more. I think it's because I've held it in for so long.

08:32.020 --> 08:39.620
Guys, it's really dense up here so we need to get moving. We're just gonna try and take all the kit up this slope basically.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.620
Bring it up because I think the tide's coming in and then try and find some way to fucking sleep.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
Can you take this camera of course?

08:46.620 --> 08:48.620
All of the women will be filming.

08:48.620 --> 08:53.620
But four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.620
They'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.620
Please, could you just push me at my back? No, it's my weight. I can't get it up.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.620
Here. Wait. That's it. That's what I needed.

09:04.620 --> 09:09.620
The women have no food and just one day's supply of drinking water.

09:11.620 --> 09:14.620
We need a decent place to sleep tonight because it's nearly dark.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.620
We're not gonna have it here. We actually need to go. We really do.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.620
All right, who wants to carve the way?

09:20.620 --> 09:28.620
To stand any chance of surviving, they've been provided with three knives, three machetes and some basic fishing equipment.

09:28.620 --> 09:32.620
Anybody that's using a knife, just tell us. Don't whack it out.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.620
Guys, are we going right or straight?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.620
Guys, should we get together and have a chat?

09:39.620 --> 09:40.620
Well, let's ask her.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.620
Shall we come up? There's a clearing.

09:42.620 --> 09:47.620
With little daylight left, the group's priority must be to find a safe place to camp and quickly.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.620
We can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.620
100%. 100%.

09:53.620 --> 09:57.620
Do you want to lead the way? Make a decision. You lead the way.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.620
Anywhere you think looks the clearest, we'll follow you.

10:00.620 --> 10:06.620
I'm not going that way, right? It's more dense and the light is through over here, so I want to go over here.

10:06.620 --> 10:09.620
Guys, be really careful when you come in on this trail.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.620
I'm still going up.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
Keep going. Keep going.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.620
Need to get the fuck out.

10:15.620 --> 10:16.620
What?

10:16.620 --> 10:17.620
Oh!

10:17.620 --> 10:18.620
Stay still. We've got dinner.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
Oh, my God.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.620
What is it?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.620
Snake.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.620
It's right near me.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.620
A huge fucking snake came towards me.

10:26.620 --> 10:27.620
It's fine.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.620
I think what you need to do...

10:29.620 --> 10:30.620
Fucking hell.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.620
Right, it's going up the tree, girls.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.620
Shall I just chop its head off?

10:34.620 --> 10:36.620
It came right at me.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.620
What? What, its head?

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
And it came straight towards me.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.620
And then we stood on it.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.620
That's why I ran away.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.620
Oh, fuck.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.620
I'm going to fucking die on this island.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.620
You're not going to die. You are not going to die.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.620
It came right towards me like that.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.620
Just breathe slowly and walk up to me now.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.620
How am I going to sleep in this island?

10:59.620 --> 11:00.620
Come on. What's her name?

11:00.620 --> 11:01.620
Jamie.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.620
Jamie, come to me.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Oh, my God.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.620
Just come to me.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.620
Right, I'll come to you.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.620
To be honest, I'm frightened of everything.

11:10.620 --> 11:15.620
Bogs and snakes and crocodiles and sharks.

11:15.620 --> 11:19.620
But I really, really want to overcome the fear.

11:21.620 --> 11:25.620
Materialistic things really shouldn't matter.

11:25.620 --> 11:29.620
But, unfortunately, they do matter a lot to me.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.620
I can't imagine what it's going to be like

11:32.620 --> 11:35.620
going back to complete and utter basics.

11:35.620 --> 11:39.620
It might change me into a new woman completely.

11:39.620 --> 11:40.620
I have no idea.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.620
Oh, I was on an island for two minutes

11:42.620 --> 11:44.620
and a snake attacked me. Fuck me.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.620
I don't want a snake coming towards me.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.620
Take a deep breath, please.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.620
OK.

11:49.620 --> 11:50.620
Just in.

11:50.620 --> 11:51.620
Just stand still.

11:51.620 --> 11:52.620
And breathe in.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.620
Right.

11:53.620 --> 11:54.620
And breathe out.

11:54.620 --> 11:55.620
It's not going to get you.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.620
It looks like it's bloody coming.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.620
It's bloody not. Stop fucking looking for it.

12:00.620 --> 12:04.620
So, basically, the whole place is crawling with snakes.

12:04.620 --> 12:05.620
Go on. Move on.

12:07.620 --> 12:08.620
Keep moving.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.620
I want to get out of here.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.620
When you're pushing through dense jungle into the unknown,

12:13.620 --> 12:15.620
everything is a potential threat.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.620
You've got caiman crocodiles, you've got snakes,

12:17.620 --> 12:18.620
you've got wild pigs,

12:18.620 --> 12:22.620
all of which are most likely to attack when they're surprised.

12:22.620 --> 12:23.620
You let your guard down,

12:23.620 --> 12:27.620
the wild is going to bite you on the backside hard.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.620
I feel like everything's crawling on me.

12:29.620 --> 12:30.620
It's not.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.620
You've got to try and just take your mind away

12:32.620 --> 12:34.620
and just pretend you're walking through some lovely area

12:34.620 --> 12:37.620
of a botanical garden.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.620
Oh, shit, there's a yucca.

12:39.620 --> 12:40.620
Oh, wow.

12:40.620 --> 12:41.620
Right in front of us.

12:41.620 --> 12:42.620
Look.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.620
Look.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.620
We've got a yucca.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.620
Guys, we need to get our priorities straight.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.620
It's an early win.

12:50.620 --> 12:54.620
They've identified a valuable source of carbohydrate.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.620
We're getting too excited about yucca.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.620
I'm actually quite concerned about sleeping not yucca.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.620
This is nuts.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.620
I didn't know places like this existed.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.620
Oh, my hair.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620
It's caught on fire.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.620
I hear more spikes.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.620
Guys, there's spikes on this that you can't even see.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.620
We're getting denser.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.620
Is everybody happy to continue through this?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.620
Well, um...

13:17.620 --> 13:20.620
I think we need to think about how much sunlight we have left.

13:20.620 --> 13:22.620
If I have to, I'll walk through the dark

13:22.620 --> 13:25.620
because I am not sleeping here because of that snake.

13:25.620 --> 13:26.620
I'm with you on that one.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.620
I don't know what else is here.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.620
With light running out fast,

13:29.620 --> 13:33.620
the women are no closer to finding a beach to set up camp.

13:33.620 --> 13:37.620
Guys, where we just stopped, where there is quite a big open space,

13:37.620 --> 13:39.620
this might be a good place to just base.

13:39.620 --> 13:40.620
Let's do it.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.620
Right.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.620
I really, really do feel like I want to get out of this area

13:46.620 --> 13:50.620
because I feel like we've made absolutely zero progress.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.620
Let's get out of here.

13:52.620 --> 13:56.620
It's really making me quite anxious and stressing me out.

13:56.620 --> 14:00.620
14 British women have been abandoned on a remote Pacific island

14:00.620 --> 14:04.620
with nothing but the closest stand-up in and a few basic tools.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
Sorry, tree.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.620
What I want to find out is,

14:10.620 --> 14:14.620
has all of this cushioning that civilisation has experienced,

14:14.620 --> 14:18.620
has it made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct

14:18.620 --> 14:20.620
that I believe is deep within us all?

14:20.620 --> 14:22.620
OK.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.620
With night closing in,

14:24.620 --> 14:27.620
the women have decided to abandon their search for a beach

14:27.620 --> 14:29.620
and set up camp in the jungle,

14:29.620 --> 14:32.620
taking their chances with the deadly critters.

14:32.620 --> 14:33.620
Strength is the key.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.620
Strength isn't an outward thing.

14:35.620 --> 14:36.620
It's an inner thing.

14:36.620 --> 14:37.620
It's an inner quality.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.620
And whether you're a man or a woman, you can have that.

14:39.620 --> 14:42.620
It's about how you react to the hardship.

14:53.620 --> 14:58.620
Ring, ring, go away, come again

14:58.620 --> 15:00.620
When we get off there sailing

15:00.620 --> 15:02.620
Just got changed and now it's raining.

15:02.620 --> 15:03.620
Oh, yeah?

15:03.620 --> 15:05.620
I've only got me normal pants.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.620
If the women are to survive,

15:07.620 --> 15:11.620
they'll need to live through six weeks of the tropical storm season.

15:13.620 --> 15:14.620
At its worst,

15:14.620 --> 15:19.620
the torrential rain can dump up to an inch of water in an hour.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.620
My current knickers and trousers are wet through,

15:22.620 --> 15:25.620
so I feel like I've wet myself a bit.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.620
I've been wearing a shitty nappy.

15:27.620 --> 15:32.620
I have dry socks, though, which are in my bra.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.620
Keeping it even drier.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.620
Yeah, that's a good idea.

15:36.620 --> 15:40.620
Without shelter, the only protection the women have from the elements

15:40.620 --> 15:42.620
is their raincoats and ponchos.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.620
It's absolutely hideous.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.620
It's going to get dark soon.

15:46.620 --> 15:50.620
And that will mean that there's no heat at all.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.620
So we will go to bed cold and damp,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.620
and we'll have to sleep on a cold and damp jungle floor.

15:56.620 --> 16:03.620
I've got my fucking hands in my hairdresser.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.620
And, like, I can't afford this.

16:12.620 --> 16:16.620
Do you want to see the water coming out of my socks on film?

16:16.620 --> 16:18.620
Don't worry.

16:18.620 --> 16:22.620
7pm, and the women are determined to get a fire started.

16:22.620 --> 16:25.620
If you can find another tree with some of that, great.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.620
But that will burn very, very quickly.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.620
It's cold and it's horrible.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.620
I'm trying to actually not even think about it.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.620
That's what I'm trying to do at the moment,

16:32.620 --> 16:35.620
just focus on what's going on and not focus about the dark.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.620
Because if we don't get a fire and we sit down, awful.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.620
After just two days' survival training,

16:41.620 --> 16:45.620
Becky, Georgina and their team have made a bow and drill.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.620
And we move this really slow and low, Becky.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.620
I like it long and I like it slow.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.620
Spinning one piece at a time.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.620
One piece of wood against another should create enough friction

16:58.620 --> 17:00.620
to produce a burning ember.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.620
Honestly, who'd be a bloody caveman?

17:07.620 --> 17:09.620
We've done it once, we'll do it again.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.620
We can do this, girls. We can do it.

17:13.620 --> 17:15.620
We're all so desperate to make fire

17:15.620 --> 17:18.620
and the conditions are just so wet.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.620
I just have a feeling we're going to stay up all night

17:21.620 --> 17:23.620
and try and make fire.

17:23.620 --> 17:24.620
Any smoke?

17:25.620 --> 17:28.620
How long do you think the girls have been at it now?

17:28.620 --> 17:32.620
Three hours, maybe more than three hours.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.620
These women I'm with are amazing.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.620
I've gone from absolutely terrified

17:38.620 --> 17:43.620
to sheer thrill and enjoyment.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.620
Oh, there's tons of smoke.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.620
It's like a frigging wigwam.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.620
Keep going.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.620
I don't think I can hold it much longer.

17:51.620 --> 17:52.620
Ah!

17:55.620 --> 17:56.620
Bloody good ember.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.620
We're going for it.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.620
Maybe it's going too far on that one.

18:02.620 --> 18:03.620
Yes.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.620
You're very nearly there.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.620
Here we go!

18:07.620 --> 18:08.620
Oh, my God!

18:08.620 --> 18:09.620
Wow!

18:09.620 --> 18:10.620
Do it again, just a little bit more.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.620
Oh, my God!

18:11.620 --> 18:12.620
Oh, my God!

18:19.620 --> 18:21.620
Us women just like to do this by persistence,

18:21.620 --> 18:23.620
persistence, persistence.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.620
Yeah.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.620
Becky and her team's determination has paid off.

18:27.620 --> 18:28.620
Not even a little fire.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.620
A fucking giant one.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.620
After just five hours of trying,

18:32.620 --> 18:35.620
these women have achieved what took mankind

18:35.620 --> 18:37.620
hundreds of thousands of years.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.620
Guys, how are we actually feeling about the fire?

18:44.620 --> 18:46.620
But almost more importantly, what it does for the women

18:46.620 --> 18:49.620
is going to give them a sense that they're gaining control

18:49.620 --> 18:51.620
of their environment.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.620
Is everyone stripping off?

18:53.620 --> 18:55.620
She's got my dress stuck in my knickers.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.620
I don't want to sound too cocky too early.

18:59.620 --> 19:00.620
No, I don't think we should.

19:00.620 --> 19:01.620
I don't think we should at all.

19:01.620 --> 19:04.620
But right now, this is...

19:04.620 --> 19:05.620
We're winning.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.620
Oh!

19:12.620 --> 19:14.620
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.620
Fucking fuck me!

19:17.620 --> 19:19.620
What the fuck is that?

19:19.620 --> 19:20.620
What is it?

19:20.620 --> 19:21.620
Please tell me that's not a spider.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.620
What is it?

19:22.620 --> 19:23.620
It's that big crab over there.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.620
Can you see it, Jo?

19:24.620 --> 19:27.620
Oh, my God, there's no way I can sleep here.

19:27.620 --> 19:30.620
Fucking hell!

19:30.620 --> 19:32.620
We're not staying here tomorrow.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.620
We're all going together, and we're going that way,

19:34.620 --> 19:36.620
and we're not going to stop until we find a flaming beach.

19:36.620 --> 19:37.620
Oh, no.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.620
Lady's got crabs.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.620
The women have had a restless first night

19:50.620 --> 19:52.620
on the damp jungle floor.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.620
I tried to have some sleep,

19:54.620 --> 19:56.620
but the noises in the night

19:56.620 --> 19:58.620
and the crabs that were creeping up on us,

19:58.620 --> 19:59.620
I just couldn't...

19:59.620 --> 20:02.620
I just sat up all the time with the torch,

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
the head torch, like that.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.620
I did. I woke everybody up with my fart.

20:06.620 --> 20:10.620
You did about five or six big, loud ones.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.620
Yeah, well, no, no, no, they weren't loud.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.620
Oh, no.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.620
You just decided to sleep at our party.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.620
Walk me up.

20:18.620 --> 20:19.620
This is that...

20:19.620 --> 20:21.620
It's a yucca,

20:21.620 --> 20:23.620
and it's a bit like a potato.

20:23.620 --> 20:26.620
Despite lack of sleep, Julie's playing mum

20:26.620 --> 20:29.620
and has rustled up a little breakfast.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.620
I'm very excited. We've got our first foods.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.620
Oh, hang on.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.620
Oh, my God.

20:36.620 --> 20:38.620
Not as nice as normal food.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.620
When we're actually starving, it'll be absolutely amazing.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.620
The group may have found food.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.620
Add to the collection.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.620
What's that?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.620
Oh, it's swollen.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.620
But during the night, it's the women themselves

20:51.620 --> 20:53.620
that are featured on the island menu.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.620
Look at my back.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.620
I've got, like, a full face of spots,

21:00.620 --> 21:02.620
and I can't even, like, wipe my eyes,

21:02.620 --> 21:03.620
because my hands are dirty.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.620
Look at my nails.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.620
Basically, I cannot be dealing with this.

21:10.620 --> 21:14.620
One side of me is like, I want to do this, I love nature,

21:14.620 --> 21:15.620
I am one with nature,

21:15.620 --> 21:17.620
and the other side of me is just like, look at my fucking face.

21:17.620 --> 21:18.620
Are you kidding me?

21:18.620 --> 21:20.620
You know, what the fuck, right?

21:20.620 --> 21:22.620
You always look gorgeous when you're young.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.620
You do.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.620
Don't be.

21:24.620 --> 21:25.620
I think so.

21:25.620 --> 21:26.620
No.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.620
We're all young.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.620
Do you know what?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.620
Your boobs are better than mine.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.620
Well, mine are false.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.620
The urgent priority for the group

21:35.620 --> 21:37.620
is to find a safe place to camp,

21:37.620 --> 21:39.620
away from the jungle creatures

21:39.620 --> 21:41.620
and near a sustainable water source.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.620
There's only going to be, what, like, 20 litres of water,

21:45.620 --> 21:48.620
and that's not lasting us 14 people for very long.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.620
As nice as this camp is, we want to...

21:55.620 --> 21:57.620
I am trying to be nice.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.620
Go and find the beach.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.620
So, one group's going to go look,

22:01.620 --> 22:03.620
and one group's going to stay here.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.620
Who's in the go group?

22:04.620 --> 22:05.620
Can I come?

22:05.620 --> 22:06.620
Yeah.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.620
Have you got your whistles?

22:07.620 --> 22:08.620
Yes, we've whistled us.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.620
Hold on a minute.

22:09.620 --> 22:13.620
You think that you can walk right round this island in the water?

22:13.620 --> 22:14.620
We don't know.

22:14.620 --> 22:15.620
I don't know.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.620
It's trial and error, isn't it?

22:16.620 --> 22:17.620
I don't think so.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.620
I think this decision has been made a little too quickly,

22:20.620 --> 22:22.620
and I just think we need to plan.

22:22.620 --> 22:23.620
Why don't we just stay here

22:23.620 --> 22:25.620
for another few hours thinking about it?

22:25.620 --> 22:27.620
Or we could go.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.620
Are you not coming now?

22:28.620 --> 22:29.620
Yeah, I am.

22:29.620 --> 22:30.620
Off your butt, then.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.620
We're off.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.620
I've done the children.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.620
I've been mum.

22:38.620 --> 22:39.620
I've done my business.

22:39.620 --> 22:43.620
I'm at this age now where I need to do something for me.

22:43.620 --> 22:46.620
For me, when I was younger, I did want to do certain things,

22:46.620 --> 22:48.620
but I never had actually either the balls or the friends

22:48.620 --> 22:49.620
to do it with me,

22:49.620 --> 22:51.620
and I didn't have enough balls to do it on my own.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.620
And now I want to see if I can cope.

22:57.620 --> 23:00.620
So do you see if we go to the end of that bit there

23:00.620 --> 23:02.620
and see what's around the corner?

23:02.620 --> 23:04.620
I wish I had water with me.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.620
With nothing to carry it in,

23:06.620 --> 23:09.620
Abi and Fran's group set off with no water.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.620
I'm really hoping to find a beach,

23:11.620 --> 23:12.620
because last night was not good.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.620
Because last night was not fun.

23:14.620 --> 23:19.620
My body does not like this at all.

23:19.620 --> 23:23.620
I hope there's paradise beyond these rocks.

23:23.620 --> 23:27.620
Finding a good camp is a key priority.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.620
They'll need a base with vital resources close at hand,

23:30.620 --> 23:32.620
the sea for food,

23:32.620 --> 23:34.620
the materials to build a shelter,

23:34.620 --> 23:36.620
and a plentiful water source.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.620
Let that be a beach, please.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.620
Oh, my God, it's grim.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.620
I have a feeling when the tide is high,

23:44.620 --> 23:45.620
that disappears.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.620
What, the whole of that?

23:46.620 --> 23:47.620
I agree.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.620
And that's a mangrove there.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.620
Yeah.

23:50.620 --> 23:52.620
This whole thing's been futile round this side, then.

23:52.620 --> 23:53.620
This is shit.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.620
What do you want to do?

23:55.620 --> 23:56.620
I need to have a drink.

23:56.620 --> 24:00.620
So we have a good trek to get back to drink town.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.620
I'm, like, shattered.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.620
We can't let this island take its toll on us on the second day.

24:09.620 --> 24:11.620
It's hot. We don't have water.

24:12.620 --> 24:16.620
Just even trekking is a risk right now.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.620
The women have left themselves exposed

24:18.620 --> 24:21.620
in oppressive 30-degree heat with nothing to drink.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.620
I'm sick.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.620
I'm going to have to sit down in a minute.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.620
I'm going to collapse.

24:26.620 --> 24:29.620
It's a long way back to their temporary camp.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.620
Guys, we've had a fall.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.620
Oh, fuck.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.620
OK, don't panic.

24:39.620 --> 24:41.620
Shit, no, don't. Are you all right?

24:42.620 --> 24:44.620
Oh, shit, no, wait.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.620
Sit forward. Sit forward.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.620
You've got to sit forward.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.620
OK, here we go.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.620
Put your head down low. Low, low, low, low, low.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.620
Don't let your head burn.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
I'm so sorry. I know.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.620
Would you stop apologising?

24:58.620 --> 25:00.620
In temperatures like this,

25:00.620 --> 25:02.620
the women have got to drink a lot,

25:02.620 --> 25:05.620
between two and four litres of water a day.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.620
If they don't, they're finished.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.620
Come on, friend.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.620
Let's do a little walk.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.620
My parents were Iranian, like, very protective,

25:17.620 --> 25:21.620
and I have literally lived such a sheltered life.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.620
All of the decisions in my life have been made for me.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.620
All they ever see is just study and get married.

25:28.620 --> 25:31.620
I want to prove that I can be independent,

25:31.620 --> 25:36.620
that I can survive and that I can make decisions for myself.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.620
Yeah, go back, get a drink.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.620
That's it. I just feel like I'm on a bomb.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.620
I actually just thought we'd find some idyllic beach within 24 hours,

25:48.620 --> 25:51.620
but actually, the reality is we're actually only something like,

25:51.620 --> 25:56.620
oh, God, a few hundred metres away from where we jumped out the stupid boat.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.620
So, right now, I feel a bit of a failure.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.620
I can't believe we can't get out of here.

26:03.620 --> 26:07.620
The whole notion of surviving on a tropical island may sound idyllic,

26:07.620 --> 26:12.620
but the reality behind the picture postcard fantasy is brutal.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.620
It may look like paradise,

26:14.620 --> 26:19.620
but trying to survive on an island like that really can be hell on earth.

26:22.620 --> 26:25.620
I've been trying to keep these tears in all along.

26:25.620 --> 26:28.620
Stop it, Jade. Just try and stop.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.620
Just try and stop, cos it'll make you feel worse by crying.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.620
That's my friend.

26:37.620 --> 26:40.620
It's not great, I'm not gonna lie.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.620
Day three on the island.

26:42.620 --> 26:46.620
The women have been forced to spend another night of misery in the jungle

26:46.620 --> 26:50.620
after failing to find a safe place to camp with a water source.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.620
Everybody just needs to find that bloody beach,

26:52.620 --> 26:54.620
cos I'm not staying here again tonight.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.620
No way.

26:58.620 --> 27:01.620
Stop with the tears, because it isn't going to do anything.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.620
It's not going to change anything.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.620
I think Jade's really struggling with just getting used to...

27:06.620 --> 27:09.620
..like, island life, as we all are.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.620
I know that sounds really harsh, and I'm not being a bastard,

27:12.620 --> 27:13.620
I'm trying not to be, but...

27:13.620 --> 27:15.620
No, it's the truth, yeah.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.620
I sometimes, with my children, have to just say,

27:17.620 --> 27:20.620
''Shut up.'' Do you know what I mean? To pull them round.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.620
Can't you channel your anger through somewhere else?

27:22.620 --> 27:24.620
Yeah, I'm angry with Bear Grylls.

27:24.620 --> 27:26.620
Go with that thought. Yes.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.620
Just go with that thought.

27:28.620 --> 27:31.620
Yeah, I'm really angry with Bear Grylls.

27:37.620 --> 27:40.620
More desperate than ever to get out of the jungle,

27:40.620 --> 27:44.620
the women are sending out another search party to find a beach camp.

27:44.620 --> 27:48.620
Can we form a circle or something, so we can have a chat?

27:48.620 --> 27:53.620
But before they leave, Jade has an announcement to make.

27:53.620 --> 27:56.620
I am not prepared for something like this.

27:56.620 --> 27:59.620
I'm really, really glad that I've come here,

27:59.620 --> 28:02.620
but I don't want to continue.

28:02.620 --> 28:04.620
That's perfectly fair.

28:04.620 --> 28:05.620
What is it that's tipped you over the edge,

28:05.620 --> 28:08.620
that you just can't cope with any more?

28:08.620 --> 28:12.620
Everything's wet, even my socks are wet, my shoes are wet.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.620
I've got bites all over my hand on my face,

28:14.620 --> 28:16.620
and, yeah, they go in, and they might not look as bad.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.620
Did you not think that was always going to happen, though,

28:18.620 --> 28:20.620
that we were going to get bitten and we were going to get wet?

28:20.620 --> 28:23.620
You're wet and you're cold and you're this and you'll go back...

28:23.620 --> 28:25.620
And I'm ill. I'm unwell. And you'll have food.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.620
I'm unwell. I've been bitten to shit, I'm unwell,

28:27.620 --> 28:30.620
and my health comes first, and...

28:30.620 --> 28:32.620
If we found the beach today,

28:32.620 --> 28:34.620
and if we did find the glorious beach

28:34.620 --> 28:35.620
that there is,

28:35.620 --> 28:37.620
then things could be so different.

28:37.620 --> 28:39.620
I don't know what to say.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.620
I know I can see.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.620
I don't want to, yeah, and that's all honesty.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
Put my hands up, you know.

28:46.620 --> 28:49.620
Put my shriveled, hanging nail,

28:49.620 --> 28:51.620
bitten hands up.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.620
Jade, I'm really enjoying the experience,

28:54.620 --> 28:57.620
but I don't like that I've been bitten on my face.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.620
I look like shit. I'm just looking at myself,

28:59.620 --> 29:01.620
and I look like shit.

29:01.620 --> 29:03.620
I'm just kind of a bit over it,

29:03.620 --> 29:04.620
and it's like, you know, if you don't want to be here,

29:04.620 --> 29:07.620
you don't want to be on the edge, fuck off.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.620
Unable to persuade Jade to stay...

29:09.620 --> 29:11.620
Foxtrot to Bravo.

29:11.620 --> 29:14.620
..the women have no choice but to use their emergency sat phone

29:14.620 --> 29:17.620
to request her evacuation from the island.

29:17.620 --> 29:21.620
I know this is total bitching, but I'm just going to be honest.

29:21.620 --> 29:27.620
She comes across really unintelligent.

29:27.620 --> 29:32.620
She is not intelligent enough to actually realise

29:32.620 --> 29:33.620
what she was getting herself into.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.620
Coming on the island.

29:35.620 --> 29:39.620
Bye, love. I can't get up. I've got nothing on my feet.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.620
After less than 48 hours on the island,

29:42.620 --> 29:45.620
hairdresser Jade is making her way to meet the boat

29:45.620 --> 29:48.620
that will take her back to civilisation.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.620
What's the point of me waxing my bikini?

29:51.620 --> 29:53.620
I haven't even shown my legs yet.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.620
The truth is, for the women on this island,

29:58.620 --> 30:00.620
every single one of them will have a low point.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.620
It is just a nature of survival.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.620
No! No!

30:07.620 --> 30:10.620
This is all about seeing who, in those moments,

30:10.620 --> 30:12.620
who rises and who crumbles.

30:15.620 --> 30:18.620
Right, everyone take a whistle. Thank you.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.620
The women urgently need to get their search for a camp under way

30:21.620 --> 30:24.620
and find a permanent water source.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.620
Their original supply of drinking water has run out.

30:27.620 --> 30:30.620
All they have now is one muddy puddle.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.620
We've gone that way.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.620
The one direction we haven't gone is that way.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.620
Yeah, that's where we are, thank you.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.620
This time, 58-year-old Forrester's daughter Fee

30:41.620 --> 30:44.620
will lead the expedition party's hunt for a beach.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.620
I'm used to being in forests,

30:47.620 --> 30:49.620
and I'm not going to be really happy

30:49.620 --> 30:51.620
if people start telling me I'm going the wrong way.

30:51.620 --> 30:56.620
The most important thing is that we go, and we go in a straight line.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.620
Seven women volunteer to join Fee on the trek,

30:59.620 --> 31:01.620
including furniture maker Kate.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.620
She's got the sense of direction.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.620
I'm following her.

31:04.620 --> 31:08.620
Abi, Fran and three others stay behind in their temporary camp

31:08.620 --> 31:10.620
to keep the vital fire alight.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.620
We will come back with a beach.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.620
Please do.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.620
Go on, move on.

31:17.620 --> 31:21.620
Fee's plan is to cut right through the dense jungle interior

31:21.620 --> 31:23.620
to the opposite side of the island.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.620
This is not a decent route.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.620
It's full of veins and everything.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.620
We're in a jungle.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.620
I know.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.620
Splitting up your group is a high risk.

31:32.620 --> 31:36.620
But if you do decide to send out an advance party...

31:36.620 --> 31:39.620
Preparation, preparation, preparation.

31:39.620 --> 31:43.620
It really is fundamental to good survival.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.620
..and you've got to prepare for any eventuality.

31:46.620 --> 31:50.620
One small mistake can quickly spiral out of control.

31:50.620 --> 31:54.620
I've got our group water where we can keep hydrated.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
With rations restricted,

31:56.620 --> 32:00.620
they've only brought two litres with them in improvised bamboo cups.

32:00.620 --> 32:01.620
In this heat,

32:01.620 --> 32:04.620
that's likely to last less than an hour.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.620
I love it. I actually think that's really tasty.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.620
It is nice, isn't it?

32:07.620 --> 32:08.620
I think the bamboo flavours it.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.620
In the last nine or ten years,

32:13.620 --> 32:16.620
I've been made redundant four times.

32:16.620 --> 32:20.620
I went from being this high-flying career woman to nothing.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.620
I don't think the children have anything about me

32:24.620 --> 32:26.620
that they would talk to their friends about.

32:26.620 --> 32:28.620
You know, Daddy designs roads for a living.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.620
I don't think there's anything...

32:31.620 --> 32:33.620
..that makes me amazing to them.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.620
I have to finish it and have to do it

32:35.620 --> 32:37.620
and make my children proud of me.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.620
Fee? What?

32:38.620 --> 32:40.620
What about that way? That's downhill.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.620
And there's lots of sunlight, which means...

32:42.620 --> 32:45.620
No, we've had lots of matches with lots of sunlight.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.620
What we need to do is get up here.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.620
Fuck!

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
George, I'm just going to forge ahead.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.620
She's going through anything.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.620
Doesn't matter what it is, Fee's going to go through it.

32:55.620 --> 32:56.620
She's on her mission.

32:59.620 --> 33:00.620
George.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.620
George, I have no idea if this is going to work.

33:03.620 --> 33:06.620
Who gives a fuck? At least we're trying.

33:06.620 --> 33:10.620
Fee's expedition party are now deep in the island's jungle interior.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.620
What?

33:11.620 --> 33:14.620
I've ripped my trousers even more.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.620
I couldn't get any more ripped.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.620
Fluids are running dangerously low

33:18.620 --> 33:20.620
and they still have no idea how far they are

33:20.620 --> 33:22.620
from a beach or a water source.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.620
They're just losing so much water.

33:25.620 --> 33:28.620
In unrelenting 34-degree heat,

33:28.620 --> 33:31.620
the group are now sweating a litre of water an hour.

33:32.620 --> 33:35.620
The more we're sweating, the more we're losing, aren't we?

33:35.620 --> 33:37.620
Is that us running out of water now?

33:37.620 --> 33:38.620
Yep. Yeah.

33:38.620 --> 33:39.620
Oh, dear.

33:39.620 --> 33:43.620
We've run out of water, which is pretty stupid, actually, I think.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.620
God, this is nuts.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.620
Lost and adrift in the jungle interior,

33:51.620 --> 33:53.620
the women have no idea what they're doing.

33:53.620 --> 33:56.620
The women have no idea when they'll find their next drink.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.620
It's hard work. It's just draining.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.620
Yeah. It's like being in a spider's web.

34:01.620 --> 34:05.620
Is there any way to get fucking through?

34:06.620 --> 34:07.620
This is looking better.

34:07.620 --> 34:09.620
Wow. Look at that.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.620
Sky!

34:11.620 --> 34:13.620
I can smell the sea.

34:13.620 --> 34:14.620
Fuck!

34:15.620 --> 34:18.620
If we get there, can we have a celebratory swim?

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
I'm not wearing any pants.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.620
Do I just have to go for the full-on mask?

34:22.620 --> 34:23.620
Yeah.

34:23.620 --> 34:24.620
I don't want to.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.620
Whoa!

34:25.620 --> 34:26.620
I can feel it.

34:26.620 --> 34:27.620
Yeah, it's here.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
Whoa!

34:28.620 --> 34:30.620
I can see a fucking palm tree.

34:30.620 --> 34:31.620
Whoo!

34:31.620 --> 34:34.620
Unless I'm delusional, that is the decking sea woman.

34:34.620 --> 34:35.620
This is for us.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.620
Guys, we found it!

34:37.620 --> 34:38.620
Is there a beach?

34:38.620 --> 34:39.620
Yes!

34:39.620 --> 34:40.620
Oh, God.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.620
Whoo!

34:42.620 --> 34:43.620
Look at this.

34:43.620 --> 34:44.620
Oh, my God.

34:44.620 --> 34:45.620
I feel like I'm going to cry.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.620
Oh, my God, it's being sunk!

34:47.620 --> 34:48.620
Yes!

34:48.620 --> 34:49.620
Whoo!

34:49.620 --> 34:50.620
God, God!

34:50.620 --> 34:51.620
Amazing.

34:51.620 --> 34:52.620
Yes!

34:52.620 --> 34:53.620
Whoo!

34:53.620 --> 34:54.620
Whoo!

34:54.620 --> 34:55.620
Oh, my God!

34:55.620 --> 34:56.620
It's like a mountain.

34:56.620 --> 34:57.620
Whoo!

34:57.620 --> 34:58.620
Although, really?

34:58.620 --> 34:59.620
Did you ever think we would make it?

34:59.620 --> 35:00.620
I honestly didn't.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
We did it!

35:01.620 --> 35:02.620
I know I'm going to cry.

35:02.620 --> 35:03.620
Come on.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.620
Oh!

35:04.620 --> 35:05.620
This is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen.

35:05.620 --> 35:20.620
And you know, if it was the most disgusting beach, this would still be the most beautiful

35:20.620 --> 35:21.620
achievement, because that in there is horrific.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.620
We're going swimming now.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.620
in that cool Pacific water.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.620
WHISTLE BLOWS

35:51.620 --> 35:53.620
With the discovery of the beach

35:53.620 --> 35:55.620
comes a lifeline for the women.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.620
Honestly, I feel so dehydrated.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.620
Basically, my mouth was feeling like Gandhi's flip-flop.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.620
No energy.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.620
We can clean our teeth...

36:09.620 --> 36:11.620
..and we can comb our hair.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.620
And I found some flip-flops.

36:16.620 --> 36:19.620
The expedition party have discovered a beach,

36:19.620 --> 36:22.620
but they're yet to find a permanent water source.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.620
It looks like it might rain.

36:24.620 --> 36:25.620
So, we're going to...

36:25.620 --> 36:28.620
We might actually be showered all night tonight.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.620
Shit.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.620
Going down dark, we have no water.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.620
We have no fire.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.620
The sand flies everywhere.

36:38.620 --> 36:41.620
So, you know, there is potential for it to be amazing,

36:41.620 --> 36:43.620
but right now I'm just thinking,

36:43.620 --> 36:46.620
oh, my God, how are we going to get through the night?

36:48.620 --> 36:52.620
With night drawing in, the women have no choice but to sleep here

36:52.620 --> 36:54.620
and return to collect the others in the morning.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.620
I can actually smell myself.

36:57.620 --> 36:58.620
Yeah.

36:58.620 --> 36:59.620
I completely hum.

36:59.620 --> 37:00.620
Yeah.

37:00.620 --> 37:01.620
My armpits smell.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.620
The worst thing is our feet.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.620
Yeah.

37:04.620 --> 37:05.620
With no shelter,

37:05.620 --> 37:08.620
the group will have to take their chances with the elements.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.620
And the frustrating thing for me is,

37:10.620 --> 37:12.620
we all bloody knew to go be prepared.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.620
Oh, my God.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.620
3am and the heavens have opened.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.620
Shivering, freezing cold.

37:22.620 --> 37:23.620
I don't like this.

37:23.620 --> 37:24.620
The women's expedition party

37:24.620 --> 37:26.620
discovered a beach to base their camp,

37:26.620 --> 37:29.620
but haven't yet found the key to their survival,

37:29.620 --> 37:31.620
a sustainable water source.

37:31.620 --> 37:34.620
We had a dunder about, well,

37:34.620 --> 37:36.620
all the palm ponds that we found for our bed.

37:36.620 --> 37:40.620
They're soaked through, stranded and dehydrated.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.620
What the good thing is about getting this wet

37:43.620 --> 37:45.620
is that we can wring out our shirts and suck them,

37:45.620 --> 37:47.620
and I'm really not joking.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.620
At the minute, we are barely coping with the situation

37:51.620 --> 37:52.620
in which we find ourselves.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.620
Barely.

37:53.620 --> 37:54.620
Barely.

37:54.620 --> 37:58.620
I mean, hardly, actually.

37:58.620 --> 37:59.620
Barely.

38:00.620 --> 38:01.620
Because we didn't prepare properly.

38:01.620 --> 38:02.620
No.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.620
That is the bottom line.

38:04.620 --> 38:06.620
And now we're sitting in the fucking rain again.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.620
Incredible.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.620
In the height of storm season,

38:09.620 --> 38:10.620
the weather can literally change

38:10.620 --> 38:11.620
in the blink of an eye.

38:11.620 --> 38:14.620
You know, one minute you're going to have scorching sunshine,

38:14.620 --> 38:16.620
the next, thunder, lightning, torrential rain.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.620
And in these sort of extreme conditions,

38:18.620 --> 38:20.620
even the thickest jungle canopy

38:20.620 --> 38:22.620
is going to give you precious little protection.

38:23.620 --> 38:31.380
7am. It's day four on the island.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.620
At their temporary camp, the night of torrential rain

38:34.620 --> 38:38.680
has also had a disastrous consequence for the five women left behind.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.940
The fire went out last night because of the weather.

38:43.660 --> 38:46.780
All the kind of wood and everything we need was wet,

38:47.120 --> 38:51.600
so when we put it on the fire, it just made the fire die.

38:52.220 --> 38:53.340
It's just gone out.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.120
The situation is critical.

38:55.780 --> 38:58.440
Without fire, the group have lost their only means

38:58.440 --> 39:00.600
of purifying the water from the muddy puddle.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.720
They're now down to capturing rainwater in Beth's poncho.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.340
This is what we're resorting to now.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.540
Roof water.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.420
On the other side of the island,

39:16.720 --> 39:19.280
the expedition party is also having to rely

39:19.280 --> 39:21.240
on an alternative source of hydration.

39:21.240 --> 39:28.540
I think all of these coconuts are making my bowels move a little bit.

39:30.160 --> 39:35.380
So I'm going to have to go and look for somewhere to try and do a poo.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.160
I may as well just do this.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.880
I'm going to have to put that on.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.040
Because I've got no fucking place.

39:47.440 --> 39:51.100
The women set off along the beach, scouring the area,

39:51.240 --> 39:53.240
looking for a sustainable water source.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.240
We saw all those riverbeds,

39:55.240 --> 39:57.940
and I reckon this is where one of them obviously comes out,

39:57.940 --> 40:00.080
because we've got this massive drainage point

40:00.080 --> 40:01.340
of all this fresh water.

40:02.960 --> 40:03.880
Hang on.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.860
Are my eyes deceiving me, or is that a huge water source?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.500
It's slightly muddy, but it's not salty.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.420
Yay!

40:14.420 --> 40:15.820
We found water!

40:15.820 --> 40:19.740
We just need to find a container now to boil it in, and fire.

40:19.740 --> 40:24.240
The discovery of the water source means the women can use this beach

40:24.240 --> 40:25.740
as their permanent base.

40:25.740 --> 40:27.240
All right, let's get going.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.540
But before they make a camp, they face a daunting trek

40:30.540 --> 40:32.740
through the jungle to collect the others.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.240
Have we got any water again now?

40:34.240 --> 40:35.240
No, we've got nothing.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Have we not got any water?

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
Nothing. We've got nothing.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.740
So we're going on this trek knowing that we're going to get

40:39.740 --> 40:43.240
absolutely fucked and dehydrated.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.740
Now, honestly, I have no idea if this is right,

40:45.740 --> 40:48.040
but we've made a plan, so we've got to stick to it.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.240
Navigating under...

40:49.240 --> 40:52.240
thick jungle canopy is always going to be difficult.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.240
It's going to be unpredictable, you don't get reference points,

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
you haven't got the sun to guide you,

40:57.240 --> 41:00.240
and embarking on a journey like that in 30-degree heat

41:00.240 --> 41:03.240
with no water, really, you're on borrowed time.

41:05.740 --> 41:07.240
You need to do it like you mean it.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
Shall we show you?

41:09.240 --> 41:10.240
Brilliant.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.240
The women are marking their path

41:13.240 --> 41:16.240
to help find their way back to the beach on their return.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.240
Found a period tree.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.240
It's on its monthly right now.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.240
Let's go this way. It looks like there's a bit of a path.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.240
I think we should be going more that way.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
Which way? No way.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
No!

41:28.240 --> 41:29.240
That's going back on ourselves.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
Exactly. We've just got to keep going this way, I'm afraid.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.240
This is actually the opposite direction.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.240
We're going back towards the beach.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.240
What the fuck is this?

41:40.240 --> 41:43.240
The expedition party are deep in the jungle interior

41:43.240 --> 41:46.240
and have mistakenly headed north in the wrong direction

41:46.240 --> 41:48.240
from their temporary camp,

41:48.240 --> 41:51.240
now completely lost, they're doubling back on themselves.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.240
You know, you have to ask yourself the reason they haven't come.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.240
Do you think they're not coming?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.240
Well...

42:00.240 --> 42:02.240
They've got to come back.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.240
Abi and the others have been unable to relight their fire

42:06.240 --> 42:08.240
and have run out of drinking water.

42:08.240 --> 42:11.240
They are now desperate for the other women to return.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.240
I'm really fed up.

42:14.240 --> 42:18.240
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, four days, 100 metres from home,

42:18.240 --> 42:21.240
100 metres from being dropped off. It's crazy.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.240
Which way do you think our current base is?

42:24.240 --> 42:26.240
Well, I think...

42:27.240 --> 42:28.240
..it...

42:28.240 --> 42:30.240
Oh, fuck.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.240
I'm so confused, I don't know.

42:33.240 --> 42:38.240
The expedition party remain lost and dangerously dehydrated.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.240
What just happened there?

42:46.240 --> 42:49.240
I was just calling so that hopefully the base camp

42:49.240 --> 42:52.240
will be able to hear the hello and make a sound back.

42:52.240 --> 42:55.240
Hello!

42:56.240 --> 42:57.240
Listen.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.240
Hang on. Shush! Shush!

42:59.240 --> 43:01.240
Blow again. It was a one-whistle response.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.240
Hello!

43:04.240 --> 43:05.240
Yeah, that way.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.240
They definitely whistled.

43:06.240 --> 43:09.240
I wouldn't be surprised if they couldn't find the whistle at the other camp

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
and that's why they didn't reply.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.240
Hello!

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Fuck!

43:18.240 --> 43:20.240
That's the first bird.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.240
It's a minor bird.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.240
So is this fucking birds?

43:22.240 --> 43:23.240
I think it's birds, yeah.

43:23.240 --> 43:24.240
Fucking birds!

43:24.240 --> 43:26.240
We got a bit prematurely excited.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.240
Right, where the fuck do we go now?

43:29.240 --> 43:32.240
Moving through jungle, you get wall after wall of dense undergrowth

43:32.240 --> 43:34.240
and what happens when everything looks the same,

43:34.240 --> 43:36.240
it's so easy to lose your bearings

43:36.240 --> 43:39.240
and then you get that rising sense of panic.

43:39.240 --> 43:44.240
That big tree there, it's got all my slash marks in it from the way we came.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.240
I think you're getting really confused with the directions

43:49.240 --> 43:53.240
because if you go up that hill, that's where we just came from,

43:53.240 --> 43:55.240
except we came up from a beach there.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
We did not come from there, Fi,

43:56.240 --> 43:59.240
because I've been marking trees all along that route there.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.240
No, there's a much clearer way of saying it.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.240
The ocean...

44:03.240 --> 44:05.240
What I would say, Fi, at the moment, is that your way of saying it

44:05.240 --> 44:07.240
is that I'm right and everybody else is wrong.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.240
You're the one who's confident to say,

44:09.240 --> 44:10.240
I've got a great sense of direction,

44:10.240 --> 44:13.240
but you're not taking anything from anybody else.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.240
There's another slash mark here.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.240
Oh, no.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.240
We have nothing to drink.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.240
We don't know where we are.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.240
Let's do my din.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.240
I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.240
How critical do you think our situation is now?

44:30.240 --> 44:32.240
I'm absolutely crapping my pants now.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.240
All I care about is water.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.240
That is all I care about, water.

44:37.240 --> 44:40.240
It's more than 24 hours since the expedition party

44:40.240 --> 44:42.240
left their temporary camp

44:42.240 --> 44:44.240
and are now further away than ever.

44:45.240 --> 44:49.240
Back at base, the situation is critical, too.

44:49.240 --> 44:51.240
Well, they're not coming for us today, are they?

44:51.240 --> 44:53.240
Happy fucking Mondays.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.240
The women left behind are struggling to find dry wood

44:56.240 --> 44:58.240
to relight the fire, and without this,

44:58.240 --> 45:01.240
they can't purify the remaining water in the puddle,

45:01.240 --> 45:03.240
and they've barely eaten for four days.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.240
Do you think we should start a fire?

45:05.240 --> 45:06.240
Yes.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.240
Do you want to start clearing all that shite off the fire, Gran?

45:09.240 --> 45:11.240
I can't. My heart's beating like mad.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.240
So is everybody's, Gran.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.240
We're all in the same boat.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.240
Fucking hell.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.240
Let's not be bitchy, please.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.240
People can manage and people can't,

45:18.240 --> 45:21.240
and we'll have our ups and downs, but let's not bitch.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
I'm sorry.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.240
No, come and sit here. Deep breaths and don't talk.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.240
Just come and sit here.

45:25.240 --> 45:27.240
Come and sit on the comfy chair.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.240
And sit there.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.240
Don't let anyone fuck you off.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.240
Breathe in slowly, please.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.240
I've got a problem with her crying.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.240
I've got a problem with her sitting on her arse

45:42.240 --> 45:44.240
saying she doesn't feel well enough.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
Stop doing anything.

45:45.240 --> 45:47.240
All our hearts are beating fast.

45:47.240 --> 45:50.240
Julie, you just order me about all the time.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
I can't show you what I do.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
Oh, my God.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
No, that's not true.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
That's absolutely not true.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.240
Oh, my God, I was trapped the first day.

45:56.240 --> 45:58.240
We're in day four now.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.240
She needs a fucking rest.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.240
And that is it.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
Thank you.

46:05.240 --> 46:10.240
Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?

46:10.240 --> 46:12.240
And leave it there.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.240
Tension in the camera really hurts.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.240
OK.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.240
Oh, my gosh.

46:18.240 --> 46:21.240
It's just so hard.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.240
And I'm not going to leave this, so I've got this bit.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.240
I don't know how many days.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.240
Next time on the island...

46:30.240 --> 46:32.240
I think that was genuinely shitty,

46:32.240 --> 46:34.240
walking away and letting the rest of us die in a big way.

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
We need to find food.

46:35.240 --> 46:37.240
That's the big issue on the camp.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
Whoo!

46:38.240 --> 46:39.240
Yeah!

46:39.240 --> 46:41.240
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.240
Fantastic.

46:42.240 --> 46:46.240
This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in...

46:46.240 --> 46:47.240
Argh!

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
We nearly got killed, actually.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.240
..or eat you alive.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.240
Everything around us is trying to kill us.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.240
Argh!

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
Yeah, it's a scorpion.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.240
I'm dropping like flies. We've not even started yet.
