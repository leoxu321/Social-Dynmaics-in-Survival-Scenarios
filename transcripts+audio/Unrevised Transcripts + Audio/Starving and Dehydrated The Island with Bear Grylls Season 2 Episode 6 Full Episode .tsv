0	14700	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14700	22920	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll
22920	29880	be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming
29880	37080	everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance so thin now will it be brute
37080	44700	power or mental strength the winds a day watch him watch him go now go now who will have what
44700	58020	it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than
58020	59760	ever they'll have to make fire
59880	69660	hunt for food and find water oh living on the island in the middle of Tropical storm season
71220	77580	I'm still wet worse night's sleep like surely I'm gonna die soon hang on
80400	82740	when pitted against the extremes of nature
84780	88080	have these Monday women got what it takes to survive
89880	94980	just remember to how you felt when you felt and leave it there
103800	109380	it's been seven days since 14 British women were marooned on a remote Pacific Island
109380	119460	brutal conditions have already claimed two victims
119880	126780	I need to go it's been with my family and the group paid the price when they split to
126780	132240	find a sustainable water source we cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost
132240	145140	finally reunited after three days apart the women find themselves on the northern tip of the island
145140	149760	they have no water source and many haven't had a drop to drink for two days
149880	159540	it's sunny
161220	173100	so it is blaring so hot there is no outside input and it is up to us to survive and thrive
173100	175320	that is a heck of a challenge
176700	177840	oh my gosh
177840	179840	despite the oppressive
179840	193520	30 degree heat there's something to celebrate for one of the party if you'd
193520	197180	have asked me a year ago where I'll be spending my 25th birthday I definitely
197180	201440	would not have been saying oh my 25th birthday will be spent abandoned on an
201440	208260	island dehydrated and starving for the last five days the women have barely
208260	218160	eaten and had hardly anything to drink finding water it's a priority the only
218160	221860	reason we're not thinking about food is because we're so thirsty our body
221860	227500	basically tries and like compensates for everything that we're lacking when it
227500	231700	comes to survival I often talk about the rule of three which means you can survive
231700	236100	three minutes without air three days without water three weeks without food
236100	238240	and in temperatures like this the water is not enough for you to survive you
238240	243280	women have got to drink a lot between two or four liters of water a day if
243280	252580	they don't they're finished the Sun obviously makes you feel more dehydrated
252580	259120	and more weak without a sustainable water source they're surviving on rain
259120	265000	water but there hasn't been a drop for 48 hours looking at the sea you just
265000	268240	want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea you just want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea
268240	277940	it's really about diet iron brew cold freezing cold diet iron brew with ice
277940	281500	oh my god my other birthday's and I'm stressing out because no one's got me a
281500	285520	card or no one's come out for a meal and I'm just gonna be happy with some a
285520	289020	piece of fruit and some water
289020	295500	I think a bogey just came out my nose
295500	297500	eat it! eat it! eat it!
298240	300240	Waste! Waste nothing!
303240	305240	I've always loved adventure.
305240	309240	In December 2013, I set off on transatlantic rowing race,
309240	312240	3,000 miles across to Antigua.
312240	315240	It's the 30th of January and we have just had a capsize.
315240	319240	I have split my head open.
319240	321240	I didn't want to give up.
321240	325240	It had been 96 days of pushing my body and pushing my mind
325240	327240	further than I ever had before,
327240	329240	but we still had to give up.
329240	331240	So that's hard to come to terms with.
331240	333240	I will not get off the island.
333240	336240	I have to prove to myself that I can do it.
336240	339240	Happy birthday, Lauren.
339240	341240	Superwoman.
341240	343240	She's keeping us all sane.
343240	345240	She's keeping us all sane.
345240	347240	Celebrations are short-lived.
347240	351240	The women have a life-or-death priority.
351240	353240	Seeing the effect that dehydration has,
353240	357240	I couldn't really have predicted that it could be so disabling.
357240	360240	They were going to be a little bit more than that.
360240	362240	They were going to be a little bit more than that.
362240	364240	They were going to be a little bit more than that.
364240	365240	We ain't coming back until we've found water.
365240	367240	We ain't coming back until we've found water.
367240	369240	Georgie leads a group on a scouting mission
369240	371240	into the thick jungle.
371240	373240	into the thick jungle.
373240	375240	There are no pools, which is what we're after.
375240	378240	There are no pools, which is what we're after.
378240	381240	I've made sure that the island has got enough water,
381240	384240	indigenous animals, and vegetation on it to keep them alive,
384240	386240	but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it,
386240	388240	That's quite a deep pool. It's empty.
390240	392240	It's just the same shit.
393240	395240	If we don't find water, we're screwed.
397240	398240	What is that?
400240	402240	Oh, my God, there's two piglets!
402240	404240	Oh, my God!
406240	408240	Oh, my God.
409240	411240	Be careful cos if Mum's there...
411240	413240	I can actually see Mum over here.
413240	415240	Oh, oh, careful. Come away.
415240	418240	If Mum thinks the kids are threatened,
418240	420240	that's when they get really aggressive.
421240	424240	She's lying down. Come away, sweetheart.
425240	427240	She's massive. She's enormous.
427240	429240	She's, like, really near.
431240	434240	The piglets, the first thing I thought of was crackling,
434240	436240	to be honest.
436240	438240	I am hungry.
438240	441240	I don't think I could look into his little piggy eyes
441240	444240	and then kill him. I'm not ready for that yet.
444240	445240	But then again,
445240	447240	by the time I come home,
447240	451240	I'll probably be a full-blown fucking, I don't know, cannibal.
451240	453240	The pigs are given a reprieve.
453240	457240	Right now, everyone's lives depend on finding water.
458240	460240	What are we going to do?
462240	464240	You can sit down.
464240	466240	Oh!
466240	468240	Ah!
472240	474240	We're all buggered.
475240	477240	No energy to move.
477240	479240	Brian? You all right?
479240	481240	Are you OK? What's wrong?
481240	484240	Whenever I stand up, I just see all black.
486240	488240	That's dehydration, babe.
488240	490240	The situation is now critical.
490240	492240	We're going foraging. Water.
494240	497240	In a do-or-die attempt to find water...
498240	500240	Please be careful.
500240	503240	..Georgie and Fi strike out in the midday sun.
505240	507240	I just think...
507240	512240	I just couldn't sit and wilt in that sun down there.
514240	516240	The weather here is brutal.
516240	519240	You know, you've got 90%-plus humidity.
519240	521240	The heat here is oppressive.
521240	525240	So finding that fresh water source is vital.
525240	529240	The bottom line is, you go three days without it, you're dead.
531240	534240	It's so hot today. So, so hot.
535240	537240	I think we should look on here and then go back.
539240	541240	I think I'm being in a much better way.
546240	549240	I think we should look on here and then go back.
549240	551240	I'm not eating.
551240	553240	Really fast.
555240	557240	Ooh!
557240	559240	Hard work.
559240	561240	It's water. Ah! This looks good.
561240	563240	Jesus Christ!
563240	564240	We did it!
564240	565240	We did it!
565240	567240	Oh, yeah, baby.
567240	569240	I don't give a fuck where that came from.
569240	571240	We're drinking it.
573240	574240	Oh!
575240	576240	Amazing.
576240	578240	So, we hit the jackpot.
578240	580240	Picked this out.
582240	584240	OK, it's not over yet.
584240	586240	But you know what?
586240	588240	If I die, I don't care.
588240	590240	At least I don't die thirsty.
592240	593240	Hmm.
594240	597240	Obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.
597240	601240	But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.
601240	604240	All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.
604240	608240	And no matter how clean the water looks, you've got to boil it.
608240	610240	Guess what I've got?
610240	611240	Water!
611240	612240	Oh, yeah!
612240	613240	Oh, my God!
613240	614240	I'm not going to lie to you.
614240	616240	You drink it at your own risk.
619240	622240	It came from a waterfall, and it tastes fine.
622240	623240	Don't drink it.
623240	626240	Every water from waterfall, river, whatever,
626240	628240	has to be filtered and boiled.
630240	632240	Because of the parasites, it's just...
632240	634240	It's a death trap.
634240	635240	Complete.
635240	637240	The whole island is a death trap.
637240	639240	The thing is, though, we need to get this fire started,
639240	641240	because if we don't get this fire started, we're back to zero again.
641240	643240	We're back to no fucking water.
646240	649240	They haven't been able to start a fire for three days.
649240	651240	If they're to survive, this is their last chance.
652240	654240	Oh, my God.
654240	656240	I won't stop until the fire is ready.
656240	658240	Because then I know that we can drink.
658240	659240	Yeah.
661240	662240	Just go through that smoke.
662240	664240	Pretend it's not even smoking.
664240	665240	I think we've got it, I think we've got it.
665240	666240	Go, stop, stop.
669240	670240	It's really hard.
670240	671240	And again, and again.
671240	672240	It's got enough...
672240	674240	It's there, it's there, it's there.
674240	675240	Well done!
675240	677240	Guys, we've got fire!
677240	680240	Well done, girls!
680240	681240	Woo!
681240	682240	Woo!
683240	685240	Can we just taste the water?
685240	687240	Ah, look, look, look, look, look, look.
687240	690240	Look at that fire.
690240	692240	The water won't be safe to drink
692240	694240	until it has boiled some three hours later.
694240	697240	Meanwhile, Lauren's keeping the fire going.
697240	700240	The fire is so hot, it's burning through everything.
700240	702240	The busty girl...
702240	703240	Yeah.
703240	706240	..is doing all the hard work, and she's exhausted.
706240	708240	I'd say that Lauren and Beth...
708240	709240	Lauren and Beth...
709240	711240	..are always the first in there to help.
712240	715240	Rosé, they think of things.
715240	716240	Oh, shit!
716240	717240	Oh, shit!
717240	719240	Lauren, Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!
719240	720240	Go to the sea now!
720240	721240	Fucking hell!
721240	723240	Shit!
723240	726240	She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.
726240	727240	Oh, fuck!
727240	729240	Right in there, babe!
729240	731240	Get her right immersed in the sea.
731240	732240	Jesus!
732240	737240	Oh, fuck!
737240	738240	Oh, shit!
738240	739240	Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!
739240	740240	Go to the sea!
740240	742240	Go into the sea now!
742240	744240	Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.
744240	746240	Day seven on the island,
746240	749240	and Lauren's been tending a jerrycan of boiling water on the fire.
749240	752240	She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.
752240	755240	Jesus! What's happened? What's happened?
755240	758240	The pressure of the jerrycan has exploded.
758240	760240	How are you feeling?
760240	762240	Fine. OK.
762240	765240	Stay there for now. Keep in the water.
765240	769240	For the moment, Dr Belinda can't tell how badly scolded Lauren is.
769240	773240	What you say is to run whatever it is under cold water for exactly...
773240	776240	We'll see the extent of it in a minute.
776240	779240	Just everything seems to be going a bit...
779240	781240	It's just her 15 years old,
781240	784240	so she thinks Lauren's, like, one of our strongest people.
784240	788240	So if she goes down, I think it would be a big detriment to us.
788240	791240	It's like doing your water on your engine.
791240	796240	You've got to let it cool down before you open the top screw top.
796240	798240	If her burns prove to be severe,
798240	799240	Lauren will be in trouble.
799240	801240	Lauren may have to be evacuated.
801240	804240	Poor Lauren. She's not having the best birthday ever.
804240	807240	She's dehydrated and now scolded by boiling water.
807240	809240	I'm just going to keep dampening you and letting it cool.
809240	813240	Hopefully she will be back to full strength soon.
813240	815240	Lauren's face isn't scolded,
815240	819240	and Dr Belinda believes she can treat the burns on her arm.
819240	822240	Especially in the blistered area. That's the worst bit.
822240	828240	It feels like someone is singeing my arm with a hot poker.
828240	832240	I feel like people see that I'm feeling just as weak as them
832240	835240	because I actually feel like some people need strength
835240	837240	and other people to keep them going,
837240	839240	and I'm determined to be that person.
839240	841240	It's alive!
841240	843240	I'm still standing.
847240	849240	It won't get boring, it won't get boring.
849240	851240	Despite the jerrycan exploding,
851240	855240	just enough water remains for everyone to have a life-saving drink.
855240	857240	Pick your own bottle.
857240	859240	Is it all the same?
859240	861240	You just used it once.
861240	863240	No, I asked for whisky and coke.
863240	866240	Oh, I've went for some aloe vera.
866240	868240	Original drink.
868240	870240	And aloe vera is disgusting.
870240	873240	I tried it with a detox and it tastes like sperm.
881240	883240	There's a pig! Pig! There!
883240	885240	Oh, yeah!
885240	887240	Now they have a water source, food.
887240	890240	Food should be the women's big priority.
890240	891240	Biggie, biggie, biggies!
891240	893240	Hello!
893240	895240	All they've eaten in a week
895240	898240	are a few handfuls of yucca and coconut.
898240	901240	We've got two of the cutest little piglets here.
901240	904240	Their little tails wag like dogs. They're so cute.
906240	908240	Everything that moves on that island
908240	910240	really should be seen as a potential source of food,
910240	912240	and that includes the pigs.
912240	915240	Oh, you're so cute! Come here, Sage!
915240	917240	Onion!
917240	919240	Ooh!
919240	922240	To befriend them is just going to make the decision
922240	924240	to kill them a thousand times more difficult.
924240	927240	And really, in survival, there's no room for sentiment.
929240	931240	Sorry, I'm just being joined here.
931240	934240	I can hear you squeaking. What are you squeaking about?
935240	938240	And everyone's like, oh, they're so cute, they're so cute.
938240	940240	Like, we're going to eat them as pets.
940240	942240	And I'm like, I'm just thinking, you know,
942240	943240	put that girl's, like...
943240	945240	We're literally going to slice and dice those piggies.
947240	949240	Definitely, we're eating them.
949240	951240	Suckling pig.
951240	952240	Nah.
952240	953240	Would you not eat them?
953240	955240	No, they're so cute.
955240	956240	I don't care that they're cute.
956240	959240	As the time goes on, we'll be hungrier and hungrier,
959240	964240	but I am not killing the little piglets and eating them.
964240	965240	No way.
966240	967240	They're so funny.
967240	969240	Argh!
971240	974240	I've been a vegetarian basically since I was born.
974240	976240	I think it's going to be a massive challenge,
976240	981240	if I have to, by choice, eat meat.
981240	984240	But then again, maybe it's not going to be a choice,
984240	988240	because I'll be so starving and I'll just have to eat it.
989240	992240	I would definitely say I'm an animal person
992240	994240	rather than a people's person.
994240	997240	You know, animals are less stressful sometimes.
997240	999240	I will train them pigs.
999240	1001240	I'll kick them up the arse.
1003240	1005240	The moral argument is,
1005240	1009240	is do we now eat the pigs,
1009240	1013240	but then do you kill, essentially, your pet?
1013240	1015240	Piggy, piggy, piggies.
1016240	1018240	Sagey, onion.
1024240	1026240	With water running low...
1026240	1029240	Careful, these rocks are uber fucking slippy.
1030240	1033240	..an expedition party makes the hazardous journey
1033240	1034240	back to the waterfall.
1034240	1036240	That's it, guys, we're nearly there.
1036240	1038240	Jamie, hang on.
1038240	1040240	Oh!
1040240	1041240	Shit.
1041240	1043240	I saved the camera!
1044240	1045240	Good job.
1050240	1051240	That's it there.
1054240	1057240	Shit doesn't look like it's running, for fuck's sake.
1057240	1058240	No!
1058240	1059240	I don't understand.
1059240	1061240	This was pouring with water the other day.
1061240	1063240	And it's dry.
1063240	1064240	It's like...
1064240	1065240	Toll-oo.
1065240	1066240	Toll-oo.
1066240	1068240	Every day, it's gone.
1073240	1075240	The water source may be dry,
1075240	1077240	but fortunately in the tropics,
1077240	1079240	the weather can change in an instant.
1081240	1082240	Look at that.
1084240	1087240	I've never seen such a dirty grey cloud as that.
1087240	1089240	Oh, here it comes!
1089240	1091240	Let's get water quick before this happens.
1091240	1093240	Can you pass me the bottle one by one and pass them over to me?
1093240	1096240	Violent Pacific storms can dump an inch of water in an hour.
1096240	1099240	The women need to take their chances when they can.
1099240	1101240	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1101240	1103240	We need to try and protect the fire!
1103240	1105240	The wood's getting saturated.
1105240	1107240	They're using trunks to protect the water.
1107240	1109240	They're using trunks to protect the water.
1109240	1111240	They're using trunks to protect the water.
1111240	1113240	They're using trunks to protect the water.
1113240	1115240	They're using trunks to protect the water.
1115240	1117240	Congratulations.
1117240	1120240	They're using Georgie's poncho to save the fire,
1120240	1124240	but half the group has tied up trying to collect rainwater.
1124240	1125240	I can't fucking believe this.
1125240	1127240	I can't think it's organised when they feed.
1127240	1129240	Oh, hello, piggies!
1129240	1132240	Oh, they're getting sheltered.
1133240	1135240	Oh, it's cooking itself, really.
1135240	1137240	They're going to roast themselves.
1137240	1139240	Let them roast themselves.
1140240	1142240	Is that a tornado?
1142240	1144240	Wow.
1144240	1145240	Do you want to see what's inside?
1145240	1146240	So, there it goes.
1146240	1148240	It's like a big thing in the sky.
1148240	1151240	Honestly, I've never seen anything like it.
1151240	1153240	If that touches down, we're in trouble.
1153240	1154240	Oh, my God.
1154240	1159240	At their worst, water tornadoes are capable of travelling up to 150 miles an hour.
1159240	1163240	If this hits the island, it could destroy everything in its path.
1163240	1165240	It's like one of those.
1165240	1166240	It's growing as well.
1166240	1168240	It is growing.
1168240	1170240	That's pretty scary.
1170240	1174240	We're really vulnerable here and no-one can get through anything like that happens.
1174240	1175240	Well, hang on.
1175240	1178240	Is it dissipating or is it just curving?
1182240	1183240	It's gone.
1183240	1185240	It seems to have just split up and gone.
1185240	1187240	We'll get to live another day.
1187240	1188240	Shame.
1192240	1197240	While they've kept the fire alight, they've hardly collected any water.
1197240	1200240	Is that the total amount of what we've just got from that rainfall?
1200240	1201240	Yeah.
1201240	1205240	I am struggling.
1205240	1211240	As much as we nest here, Mother Nature turns up and she just shits on it.
1211240	1214240	And it's like a fucking mudslide everywhere now.
1214240	1218240	It's become clear to the women they can't survive here on Coconut Beach.
1218240	1220240	They must move camp.
1220240	1221240	Whoa!
1221240	1225240	Five days ago, the women discovered a beach on the western side of the island
1225240	1228240	with a sustainable water source nearby.
1228240	1230240	They christened it Home Beach.
1230240	1233240	Now, Lauren wants to take everyone back there.
1233240	1235240	You need to get to that Home Beach now.
1235240	1237240	The beach, the water...
1239240	1242240	It's just going to make people feel like they can actually do this.
1245240	1248240	I'm pretty confident in where that beach is.
1248240	1250240	We do have a serious problem with water.
1250240	1252240	Hopefully, Home Beach is going to sort all that out.
1252240	1254240	There's a stream there.
1254240	1256240	Yeah, and this is the, like, resources.
1256240	1258240	We can start making our shelters.
1258240	1259240	You guys haven't seen it.
1259240	1261240	You guys haven't seen it yet either, have you?
1261240	1266240	So, I've got this image of this beach that flows for, like, miles.
1266240	1273240	Palm trees, hammocks, shelter, waterfall, fish jumping from the sea.
1273240	1275240	Yeah, we saw that. We did see that.
1275240	1277240	Oh, I'm so excited.
1277240	1279240	What's the plan with the fire, guys?
1279240	1281240	Are we going to try and transport it?
1281240	1283240	We haven't got anything metal, have we, yet?
1283240	1285240	So, we'll just have to light another one.
1285240	1286240	It's all right, we're experts now.
1286240	1288240	I'm excited. It's going to be eight.
1289240	1291240	Who would like the first snail?
1294240	1297240	Sage and onion remain off the menu.
1297240	1299240	Tonight, it's just foraged snails.
1300240	1303240	It's quite salty, quite meaty,
1303240	1306240	and then there's this sharp, like, shit, basically.
1308240	1312240	And a good meal always prompts a lively conversation.
1312240	1314240	Is that it? That's it.
1314240	1315240	It's small.
1315240	1318240	I had the South African with the tiny little penis.
1319240	1322240	It was definitely a micro-penis because it was smaller than my pinky.
1322240	1324240	No, like, you know...
1324240	1326240	I said it was smaller than my pinky!
1326240	1328240	No, seriously, Beth, it's not even funny.
1329240	1333240	I really feel for them because no girl could feel that inside them.
1333240	1335240	Can you imagine?
1335240	1337240	So, what's the point?
1337240	1341240	One guy who I was dating just felt like a little twiglet.
1341240	1344240	The good thing is that they're often really good at cunnilingus.
1346240	1348240	And then you have to get special condoms
1348240	1352240	because they're so small and it's just going to slip off otherwise.
1352240	1355240	Do you actually get special condoms for them?
1355240	1357240	You can, yeah.
1359240	1361240	6.30am, day nine.
1368240	1370240	Honestly adorable.
1370240	1372240	I'm saying this about a pig.
1372240	1375240	Oh, and they're very cute. It just made me happy.
1376240	1379240	Today, the women face an arduous trek,
1379240	1382240	seeking the beach where they want to build a permanent camp.
1382240	1384240	What do you think, Jamie?
1384240	1389240	Is it worth cracking these open to get a mouthful of coconut before we set off?
1389240	1392240	No, no, it's too heavy. There's loads there.
1392240	1395240	Oh, I really want a coconut. I'm so hungry.
1395240	1397240	I'm so hungry, but someone's just said no.
1399240	1402240	I want you to just take your backpack off and I'm going to give it to Jamie.
1402240	1404240	It's a hard walk and you will find it difficult.
1405240	1407240	With very little water for the trek,
1407240	1411240	Abi and Belinda are especially concerned about PhD student Fran.
1411240	1413240	I know she's not well, but she doesn't want to leave.
1413240	1414240	It's really tricky, isn't it?
1414240	1416240	She doesn't want to make a fuss and she doesn't want to stop this.
1416240	1417240	I just want to leave the island.
1417240	1421240	Five days ago, she collapsed and received emergency medical treatment.
1421240	1423240	I'm really worried about Fran.
1423240	1427240	Every time she tries to do something, she's feeling light-headed and dizzy.
1427240	1431240	She's already passed out once due to low blood sugar,
1431240	1434240	so clearly her body's not very good at adapting to the day.
1434240	1437240	Shall we make you the bow carrier?
1437240	1440240	It's actually the most important thing ever.
1440240	1441240	Yes.
1441240	1443240	I feel like the weakest person in the group,
1443240	1447240	because everyone, even though they're really tired, they can keep going.
1447240	1450240	As I've said before, I just feel like another mouth to feed.
1452240	1453240	Guys!
1453240	1455240	Oh, no! No! No!
1455240	1458240	Havala is reluctant to leave Sage and Onion behind.
1460240	1462240	Now is time, Gordon.
1462240	1463240	Come out!
1464240	1465240	OK, we'll just grab him.
1465240	1468240	They're wild animals. They just need to be left alone.
1468240	1470240	I wanted to try.
1470240	1472240	We can't take the pits.
1474240	1476240	Guys, we're going to Home Beach!
1476240	1478240	Woo!
1479240	1482240	Bye, Sage! Bye, Onion!
1482240	1484240	Bye, dinner! Bye, lunch!
1486240	1488240	Look at us! We look like savannahs!
1488240	1490240	BOOM!
1490240	1491240	BOOM!
1491240	1492240	BOOM!
1492240	1493240	BOOM!
1493240	1494240	BOOM!
1494240	1495240	9am.
1495240	1497240	The women depart for Home Beach.
1497240	1501240	The last time they went into the jungle, they were lost for three days.
1504240	1506240	We're going down, Lauren.
1506240	1510240	This time, 25-year old nurse Lauren leads the way.
1510240	1512240	Then we're just going to head on this ridge thing.
1512240	1515240	Julie, how are you feeling?
1515240	1516240	Fuck off!
1516240	1517240	Fuck off?
1517240	1519240	Yeah. That's how I'm feeling.
1519240	1521240	Woo!
1521240	1526240	After just half an hour, Becky's in trouble.
1526240	1529240	Hold up, guys. I've just got a dry mouth.
1529240	1532240	My water bottle allocation for the day is almost done.
1532240	1534240	How's everyone doing?
1534240	1537240	Energy level's zero.
1537240	1541240	The move will eat into the women's fragile energy reserves,
1541240	1545240	but it's a gamble they must take, whatever the consequences.
1545240	1547240	Take five.
1547240	1550240	I'm feeling so shit.
1550240	1552240	If this rain keeps on going,
1552240	1555240	I feel like I'm on the brink of collapsing again.
1555240	1558240	I don't want to tell anyone cos I feel so pathetic.
1558240	1560240	I know I can do this.
1560240	1563240	I just need to keep going.
1564240	1569240	With the group exhausted, Lauren and Fi volunteer to scout ahead.
1569240	1571240	Anyone want a biscuit?
1571240	1574240	Oh, my God! Oh, you bitch!
1574240	1578240	Just a little biscuit. Just a little barbie biscuit.
1578240	1579240	Oh.
1580240	1586240	The advance party are pushing ahead through the jungle.
1586240	1588240	I think we may have found it.
1588240	1591240	We have! This is it!
1591240	1594240	I know. This is our beach!
1598240	1601240	Oh, my God. So excited.
1601240	1603240	I feel a surge of energy.
1603240	1606240	I can hear the sea!
1606240	1608240	Oh, wow!
1608240	1611240	Wow! That is amazing.
1611240	1613240	Woo!
1613240	1615240	Woo!
1615240	1617240	Woo!
1617240	1619240	Look at that!
1619240	1623240	Even in the pisto drain, this place looks ridiculous.
1623240	1626240	I just think paradise compared to where we've been.
1626240	1629240	The sea looks bluer. Everything looks better. Everything.
1629240	1632240	Our pigs! The pigs!
1632240	1634240	Yay!
1634240	1636240	They've traipsed all that way after us.
1636240	1638240	I don't know whether I could eat them now.
1638240	1639240	Oh!
1639240	1640240	Aw!
1642240	1644240	Why the king? They love us!
1649240	1651240	What the hell?
1651240	1652240	Ketchup.
1653240	1657240	I found a ketchup bottle, and I just think that's a sign.
1657240	1658240	Mm-hm.
1661240	1662240	Open ketchup.
1662240	1664240	Ketchup.
1671240	1673240	The journey has beaten Fran.
1675240	1679240	This beach is extra cold because it's kind of, like, open.
1679240	1682240	I don't feel like I can do anything in this weather
1682240	1684240	because I can't move.
1684240	1686240	It's a little bit damp.
1686240	1688240	Oh, thank you so much, hubby.
1688240	1690240	Aw, I love you.
1690240	1691240	Coming through the jungle again today,
1691240	1694240	in pouring rain, has tipped her over the edge.
1694240	1697240	She's been proper poorly. She's cold all the time.
1697240	1702240	And so when we're cold, it's, for her, it's like bloody hypothermia.
1702240	1704240	When you're wet, you're malnourished,
1704240	1707240	your body temperature just is going to drop,
1707240	1709240	and it only takes a two-degree drop
1709240	1713240	to take you right bang into that danger zone for hypothermia.
1713240	1717240	So the women have an uphill struggle getting Fran warm.
1717240	1720240	I am on firewood duty.
1720240	1724240	We need to get dry firewood.
1724240	1727240	Nothing is dry.
1727240	1730240	There's just no dry standing wood.
1730240	1732240	It's not a little bit wet.
1732240	1735240	Honestly, the place is just soddenly hoarse.
1735240	1740240	I don't feel that I could cope with another rainstorm.
1740240	1743240	I don't think I'm medically fit for this.
1743240	1745240	It really is torture for Fran.
1745240	1749240	She clearly is not a well person.
1749240	1752240	I don't even have any sort of rescue meds,
1752240	1754240	so if she were to collapse,
1754240	1758240	it would take a while to get any further medical help to us.
1758240	1760240	What's up, brother?
1764240	1767240	Fran now feels she has no option.
1767240	1770240	My body can't take it anymore. Over.
1770240	1772240	Do you then want to kick off the island?
1772240	1773240	Yes, please. Over.
1773240	1780240	I hope you feel so much better, honey.
1780240	1783240	I think you might have died if you stayed.
1783240	1785240	And I'm serious.
1785240	1786240	Thank you.
1786240	1788240	I think I would as well.
1788240	1791240	I am absolutely gutted.
1791240	1793240	I absolutely love Fran.
1793240	1794240	She's ace.
1794240	1796240	She's our little baby.
1800240	1802240	It was going to be my first challenge ever.
1802240	1805240	But I, for myself, did.
1805240	1808240	And I'm really gutted that I couldn't complete it.
1808240	1809240	It's kind of heartbreaking.
1809240	1811240	I tried so hard.
1811240	1812240	Fran, bye, my darling.
1812240	1813240	We love you.
1813240	1815240	We love you.
1815240	1816240	Another one down.
1816240	1818240	Now we need to go and anchor the others to trees
1818240	1822240	and make sure none of the others are thinking of leaving.
1822240	1825240	To lose another team member, it's so demoralising.
1825240	1829240	And you can just feel the atmosphere in camp at the minute
1829240	1831240	is just on tenterhooks and everyone's thinking,
1831240	1833240	I don't know how long I can keep going like this.
1838240	1840240	Look at this shit.
1840240	1841240	I know.
1841240	1842240	What the hell's gone on?
1842240	1845240	The storm and an extreme high tide
1845240	1847240	have washed up a potential treasure trove.
1847240	1850240	Like Paradise Beach, no longer.
1850240	1852240	Oh!
1852240	1853240	Oh!
1853240	1855240	False alarm, half a hair clip.
1855240	1857240	Ta-da!
1857240	1860240	Not only is it a can, it's a can with a lid.
1860240	1865240	I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivors' arsenal
1865240	1866240	is resourcefulness.
1866240	1867240	What's that?
1867240	1868240	Is that iron brew?
1868240	1869240	Oh, my God.
1869240	1871240	Oh, my God.
1871240	1873240	I thought it was iron brew.
1873240	1874240	Oh, my God.
1874240	1876240	Here, here, hold that, hold that.
1876240	1877240	I thought it was iron brew.
1877240	1879240	Oh, my God.
1879240	1881240	Wait, check the cell by day.
1881240	1882240	I don't care.
1882240	1887240	Oh, my God.
1887240	1888240	Oh, my God.
1888240	1889240	Shh.
1889240	1890240	Oh, my God.
1890240	1892240	So powerfully sweet.
1892240	1894240	So sugary, like, set up.
1894240	1897240	And it was just heaven, absolute heaven.
1901240	1903240	It actually just dropped on my tongue
1903240	1907240	and it felt like ecstasy, absolute ecstasy.
1911240	1914240	The women hope the wood is now dry enough
1914240	1916240	to somehow light a fire
1916240	1918240	to purify the water from a nearby pond.
1919240	1920240	This is filled up good.
1920240	1921240	Thank God for that.
1921240	1922240	Yeah, for some reason.
1922240	1923240	Thank God.
1923240	1924240	Oh, my God.
1924240	1925240	Oh, my God!
1925240	1926240	It's usually on a fire starter.
1926240	1927240	Woo!
1927240	1928240	Hang on, hang on.
1928240	1929240	Hang on.
1929240	1930240	Wait, hold on, we haven't lit a fire yet.
1930240	1931240	This is, like, so early.
1931240	1932240	Please don't go out.
1932240	1933240	Please don't go out.
1933240	1934240	To fucking wet.
1934240	1935240	Shit, what are we going to do?
1935240	1936240	Oh, my God.
1936240	1937240	Oh, my God.
1937240	1938240	Oh, my God.
1938240	1939240	Oh, my God.
1939240	1940240	Oh, my God.
1940240	1941240	Oh, my God.
1941240	1942240	Oh, my God.
1942240	1943240	Oh, my God.
1943240	1944240	Oh, my God.
1944240	1945240	Oh, my God.
1945240	1946240	Oh, my God.
1946240	1947240	Oh, my God.
1947240	1948240	Oh, my God.
1948240	1949240	Oh, my God.
1949240	1950240	Shit, what we're going to do?
1950240	1951240	Good work, Georgie.
1951240	1954240	Nothing happens without a fire.
1954240	1956240	We've got those things.
1956240	1958240	It's, it's, it's...
1958240	1959240	I can't believe how...
1959240	1960240	It's an inverted triangle.
1960240	1961240	Yeah.
1961240	1962240	Fire.
1962240	1963240	And everything comes off with a truck of fire.
1963240	1964240	That's it.
1964240	1965240	Without fire, we are...
1969240	1974240	I don't have any survival skills, but I'm absolutely happy to step up to the plate if
1974240	1977240	a crocodile needs killing, or...
1977240	1978240	Yeah.
1978240	1983160	snake needs its head chopping off and I think the key to our survival on the
1983160	1989220	island is teamwork I was actually caught in the tsunami in Sri Lanka we didn't
1989220	1992940	eat or sleep for four days so I have an understanding of what that mental
1992940	1996140	pressure is
1998200	2001680	my stopping enough pressure on it I think I'm not putting enough pressure on
2001680	2005600	it harder she tries Georgie can't get it to
2005600	2013820	light even now the wood is drier sup Jules it's half past two now no sign of
2013820	2016180	the fire
2020480	2031700	he's had any spindle left is the thing it's probably right flicking off nice
2031700	2035240	and slow that's it keep it like that the battle
2035240	2035580	for an
2035580	2039360	ember continues through the night
2039360	2044940	getting a little bit panic we're starving and thirsty I surely I'm gonna
2044940	2050320	die soon fucking stupid place the women have now been without water for more
2050320	2057020	than 48 hours and they are dangerously dehydrated I feel really drained and
2057020	2060360	really faint
2060360	2062360	I'm dead
2062360	2067360	okay to you Lauren
2067360	2068360	me
2068360	2071360	yeah me
2071360	2072360	fucker
2072360	2073360	it wasn't like that
2073360	2079360	I think we've lost this one haven't we
2079360	2084140	so this bow drill set really all the parts need to be in perfect proportion
2084140	2089140	for this to work the problem is the women's drill is now too small because
2089140	2094880	it's been so used they need to start again their situation is now beyond
2094880	2097520	critical
2097520	2104780	feel so dizzy it's fucking hard work when you've not drunk anything and the
2104780	2107260	heat
2107260	2113840	I'm really struggling it feels like a purpose on this island it's just to be
2113840	2116840	dehydrated
2116840	2117780	just to be dehydrated
2117780	2119000	it's just a bit dehydrated
2119000	2121000	I'm so tired.
2125000	2127000	Pot shot to barbell one, over.
2127000	2131000	I just wanted to let you know we need some supplies from you.
2131000	2133000	Medical advice is that the castaways
2133000	2137000	are now so critically dehydrated that within a few hours,
2137000	2139000	their lives will genuinely be in danger.
2139000	2143000	So, really, I've got no choice but to intervene,
2143000	2146000	and the women will be given a working bow drill set.
2146000	2150000	Right, fire startings, bitters.
2150000	2152000	Let's do this.
2157000	2160000	It's purring, ladies, it's purring, actually.
2168000	2170000	Oh, yes!
2173000	2175000	Yes! Woo-hoo!
2176000	2178000	Woo-hoo!
2178000	2180000	Well done!
2180000	2182000	This is amazing, isn't it?
2182000	2184000	This is great.
2184000	2186000	Woo!
2186000	2188000	Now we can start thinking about the bigger things,
2188000	2190000	like our bellies, for example.
2190000	2193000	There's a little something down there
2193000	2196000	which is sitting a bit dangerously close to the fire to me.
2197000	2199000	This is amazing.
2199000	2202000	It's cool and clear.
2202000	2205000	And that view, I feel like we're in a luxury hotel.
2206000	2208000	And then, shortly, our butler will come.
2208000	2210000	What have you ordered for butler service?
2210000	2211000	Oh, oysters.
2211000	2213000	Oh, no, not oysters. We can get them here.
2213000	2215000	Oh, yeah!
2215000	2216000	Order something you can't get here.
2216000	2218000	What would be your first?
2218000	2219000	Double cheeseburger.
2219000	2222000	Absolute whopper with everything on it.
2222000	2224000	I want to find out what you...
2224000	2227000	Now, what have you ordered from our butler?
2227000	2229000	From our room service.
2229000	2232000	I've started with some deep...
2232000	2233000	Well, sorry, it is seafood, actually.
2233000	2234000	No, really?
2234000	2235000	Some deep-fried calamari.
2235000	2237000	Deep-fried calamari.
2237000	2238000	Oh.
2238000	2240000	And then, for some weird reason,
2240000	2242000	it's a bit like being pregnant,
2242000	2245000	I want jelly and custard and ice cream.
2245000	2247000	And I don't even like ice cream.
2247000	2251000	But I'd like, you know, jelly, custard and ice cream.
2251000	2254000	And then, a kids' buffet.
2254000	2256000	Oh, kids' buffet. I'm with you with that.
2256000	2258000	Until I vomit.
2265000	2267000	Day 12 on the island.
2267000	2270000	The women now have fire and plenty of drinking water,
2270000	2274000	but they're barely surviving on just 50 calories a day.
2274000	2279000	It took me I don't know how many hours
2279000	2281000	to get that many almonds.
2281000	2284000	It's going to be one almond, if we're lucky.
2284000	2287000	After almost two weeks without a meal,
2287000	2289000	the group is at the point of starvation.
2289000	2292000	If they don't eat soon, there's a genuine risk
2292000	2294000	their organs will start to shut down.
2295000	2298000	I'm fucking hungry.
2298000	2300000	My tummy has gone away.
2300000	2302000	I literally have no tummy.
2302000	2303000	Look.
2303000	2307000	Flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.
2307000	2310000	My stomach's going, I'm going to have to eat myself.
2310000	2314000	Is that not the cutest thing you've ever seen?
2314000	2316000	Hi, Sage and Onion.
2318000	2321000	The fate of Sage and Onion hangs in the balance.
2321000	2323000	The women have befriended them
2323000	2325000	and now can't agree whether or not
2325000	2326000	to eat them.
2326000	2328000	I keep looking at those gorgeous pigs
2328000	2330000	as bits of food.
2330000	2331000	They're too cute.
2331000	2333000	We can't, I can't.
2333000	2335000	Now, imagine this.
2335000	2337000	Barbecue sauce over the ribs, right?
2337000	2339000	Barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, right?
2339000	2341000	Even the tail, really good, really chewy,
2341000	2342000	I'd still eat it.
2342000	2344000	I think we should spit roast it.
2344000	2347000	Put a steak up through its bum.
2347000	2350000	Not through its mouth, through its head, of course.
2350000	2353000	Obviously, I've got a completely different point of view
2353000	2354000	to the rest of the girls.
2355000	2358000	Because I don't eat meat, but...
2358000	2360000	Sage and Onion, they're little peglets
2360000	2362000	and definitely not eating none.
2363000	2365000	We've got two pigs, Sage and Onion,
2365000	2367000	which have become our pet pigs.
2367000	2370000	They've followed us all the way from Coconut Beach here,
2370000	2373000	which is a long walk for little legs.
2373000	2375000	They were thriving at the other beach.
2375000	2378000	What's lacking here that they could get at the other beach?
2378000	2381000	They were digging up lots of roots at the other beach.
2381000	2383000	It was really muddy,
2383000	2387000	so the water collected in the mud was in the sand.
2387000	2389000	Water doesn't really collect.
2389000	2392000	We have to set a limit to how much we do
2392000	2396000	that compromises our resources over the pigs.
2396000	2397000	Over the past few days,
2397000	2399000	people have been laid down with double vision,
2399000	2402000	retching and not being able to walk.
2402000	2405000	People are really suffering,
2405000	2408000	and you need to eat to survive.
2408000	2411000	Nobody wants to kill anything, but we need to eat.
2411000	2413000	Understandably, you know, a lot of people find the hard work,
2413000	2415000	the whole concept of killing animals,
2415000	2417000	it's either cruel, it's upsetting,
2417000	2419000	and, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,
2419000	2422000	but in a survival situation, when it comes down to the wire,
2422000	2425000	it's a simple choice, them or you.
2425000	2428000	You're really upset, everybody's really upset.
2428000	2431000	Can we show of hands that we agree that we do something soon?
2435000	2438000	So, Jamie, where's your mind thinking at the moment?
2438000	2440000	I don't want anything to do with this.
2443000	2446000	Well, who's going to kill it?
2446000	2449000	Well, that's the next question.
2449000	2453000	I have volunteered myself to do it...
2453000	2455000	Well done, Lauren.
2455000	2458000	..just because I know that I'll do it fast.
2458000	2462000	I'm going to get a little dehydrated, so I'll have a little drink.
2462000	2464000	He's crying out more than he's taken it.
2464000	2466000	Oh, that's all right.
2468000	2472000	You see, it was wrong to all get attached to them, wasn't it?
2472000	2475000	I always say, once you've named something, you're screwed.
2475000	2477000	Yeah.
2478000	2480000	The reason I'm so upset
2480000	2484000	is because they reminded me of my dog.
2486000	2487000	And...
2490000	2493000	..I really thought we were going to have some
2493000	2495000	until we left the island.
2497000	2499000	It makes everything real.
2499000	2501000	It makes everything...
2501000	2502000	..like...
2502000	2504000	..raw.
2504000	2506000	It's pretty raw, isn't it? Yes!
2506000	2508000	It's raw.
2508000	2513000	Erm, I just want to make it the most, like, peaceful...
2513000	2515000	..death.
2515000	2518000	You know, like, if I was panicking,
2518000	2520000	then it would feel that.
2523000	2525000	If anyone sees a good whacker...
2526000	2528000	I'm not annoyed at anybody.
2528000	2530000	I just don't want to have any part of it.
2530000	2532000	As long as I don't see it or hear it,
2532000	2534000	it just stops it.
2534000	2535000	Just gently holding out,
2535000	2536000	cos I don't want him to struggle,
2536000	2538000	I just want him to be relaxed.
2538000	2540000	But I tell you what,
2540000	2543000	they've had a little better life than most pigs in captivity
2543000	2545000	that have bred to the pork.
2545000	2547000	The pork we eat and the chops I buy
2547000	2549000	and the sausages I buy,
2549000	2550000	they've had no life at all.
2550000	2553000	I don't know another pig that's gone to bed with a load of people.
2555000	2556000	Ready? Should race.
2556000	2557000	Absolutely. Yeah.
2557000	2558000	One, two, three.
2562000	2564000	THEY LAUGH
2568000	2571000	Well, Lauren, absolutely amazingly well done.
2576000	2579000	You did the job really, really well. Really well.
2579000	2581000	It was quick. Quick.
2581000	2583000	And it was painless.
2583000	2585000	That was pretty emotional, wasn't it?
2585000	2587000	It was pretty horrible.
2587000	2589000	It's never easy to take a life,
2589000	2591000	but having learnt from this first kill,
2591000	2595000	they actually dispatched the second animal swiftly, cleanly,
2595000	2596000	no hesitation.
2599000	2602000	Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't distress.
2602000	2605000	Shall we get it back and get it on the barbecue?
2607000	2611000	I've never, ever killed an animal before,
2611000	2613000	especially as a girl, as well,
2613000	2618000	is that I don't think we're designed to want to kill anything,
2618000	2621000	and that's what has been a huge limit
2621000	2623000	on the burning curve for me.
2623000	2625000	You know, it's reality.
2625000	2627000	That's what it is, it's brutal reality,
2627000	2629000	that if you want to eat,
2629000	2632000	then you are going to have to kill something.
2632000	2634000	Gosh, Lauren, she's...
2634000	2636000	She was the first to volunteer for the pig.
2636000	2639000	She's very matter-of-fact, very hard-working.
2639000	2642000	Actually, if I could channel a little bit of Lauren,
2642000	2645000	I'd be very happy, because she's very impressive.
2645000	2649000	We needed something that was going to kick-start us
2649000	2653000	into not viewing animals as pets,
2653000	2657000	but rather as a way that is going to allow us to survive.
2657000	2660000	You know, it's going to give us the energy that we need
2660000	2663000	to get hunting, get finding water, to find wood,
2663000	2665000	because that is all exhausting work.
2668000	2672000	It's very sad, but if I'm perfectly, perfectly honest,
2672000	2675000	I'm really looking forward to the meat,
2675000	2678000	because I think we're all in dire need of a bit of a meal.
2680000	2683000	Harvey, just to let you know, the pig's on the fire.
2683000	2685000	I'm not being a hypocrite. I'll look later.
2685000	2687000	I'm just not ready. Thank you.
2690000	2693000	There's no way I'm going to end here until it's all done with.
2693000	2696000	I wouldn't go in there. I'm not eating a pig.
2696000	2698000	This is a really decisive moment
2698000	2700000	in a women's struggle for survival.
2700000	2705000	Now they have the mindset to progress as hunters and killers.
2705000	2708000	They've actually crossed a very important cycle
2708000	2711000	and a very important psychological line,
2711000	2714000	and for the first time, they're behaving like survivors.
2716000	2718000	Are you ready, guys?
2718000	2720000	Yeah.
2720000	2722000	This tastes good.
2723000	2727000	Oh, my God. It's unbelievably delicious.
2727000	2731000	I don't like the fact that I'm eating the piggy, but it is good.
2733000	2736000	I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like a wild animal.
2736000	2737000	SHE LAUGHS
2737000	2739000	Like a cavewoman.
2740000	2743000	Do you know what that tube is? It's a testicle.
2743000	2745000	I don't know. I quite like things like that.
2745000	2747000	Do you know what I mean? It's quite savage.
2747000	2749000	We needed that.
2749000	2751000	I'm not going to lie.
2751000	2753000	It was gorgeous.
2753000	2757000	Erm, I could have ate it all myself.
2757000	2759000	It's all good.
2759000	2762000	That's it for now. Over and out.
2762000	2768000	Next time on The Island...
2768000	2772000	You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!
2772000	2775000	We're not even halfway through and tensions are beginning to fray.
2775000	2778000	We're not all just grunts that bash on bits of wood.
2778000	2781000	The sun would look like you didn't want to do a harder job.
2781000	2783000	I would say, fuck you to that person.
2783000	2784000	Fucking calm down, eh?
2784000	2786000	There is absolutely no food in this camp.
2786000	2789000	This island is infested.
2789000	2790000	Gee-bye!
2790000	2791000	Roundy boy!
2791000	2793000	Shit!
