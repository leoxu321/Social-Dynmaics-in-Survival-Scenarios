00:00.000 --> 00:14.940
Two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one has been inhabited by 14

00:14.940 --> 00:23.280
British men while a separate island was home to 14 British women they've been utterly alone

00:23.280 --> 00:33.300
with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

00:33.300 --> 00:45.780
themselves the women have made it off alive tonight it's a final installment of the men's

00:45.780 --> 00:53.260
island you lazy bunch of bone idle bastards survival

00:53.260 --> 01:00.580
will be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height and harsh tropical storm season this

01:00.580 --> 01:09.760
island either wants to decompose you or eat you alive they'll have to find their own water and

01:09.760 --> 01:17.260
hunt for their own food with the finishing line in sight have these modern-day men got what it

01:17.260 --> 01:20.320
takes to survive I'm gonna go to hell for this

01:23.260 --> 01:41.200
five weeks ago 14 British men were dropped on a remote Pacific Island

01:41.200 --> 01:47.140
they've had some success with their fishing nets

01:47.140 --> 01:53.140
but not enough to stop their physical decline

01:53.260 --> 02:01.000
we've been here over a month now we are starting to starve be careful taking huge risks and the

02:01.000 --> 02:08.800
pursuit of food holy he's severed one of his tendons the group suffered their biggest loss

02:08.800 --> 02:15.640
he needs to be evacuated as 36 year old Will was forced to leave the island

02:16.780 --> 02:23.080
I feel devastated he's gone of all the people he wanted to finish with he was up there wasn't it we

02:23.260 --> 02:29.080
didn't finish strong as the team and now the islands thwarted that I hate this place I hate it

02:43.360 --> 02:44.200
we're in again

02:46.600 --> 02:47.860
no respite for us man

02:48.640 --> 02:52.600
thunder we're getting screwed again

02:53.260 --> 03:06.400
fair weather Islanders what's going on here oh I've got a flippings as a scorpion right don't move

03:06.400 --> 03:10.660
don't move don't move I do not want to get stung of course you don't right please be quick about it

03:10.660 --> 03:14.860
whoa let me get that way don't cut it off don't throw it off on your spot take it off take it off

03:17.440 --> 03:22.780
give it a shot yeah ain't that the thing with this island one minute it's all calm and then

03:23.260 --> 03:39.880
the men have been living on the island for an unprecedented 36 days and they're now entering

03:39.880 --> 03:46.600
uncharted territory and that's why this time only the mentally strong are going to make it to the end

03:46.600 --> 03:47.440
foreign

03:47.440 --> 03:58.480
living for five weeks on an extreme low calorie diet consisting mainly of fish limpets and coconuts

03:58.480 --> 04:03.820
the men have been getting weaker by the day pounds just keep dropping off gentlemen

04:04.660 --> 04:08.940
to make sure their physical decline doesn't become life-threatening Dr

04:08.940 --> 04:14.260
Piers has been monitoring their weight using scales from his medical kit come on you have a streak of

04:14.260 --> 04:16.780
piss that puts me uh just under

04:17.440 --> 04:19.200
Er, ten stone.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.200
My bollocks weigh more than that.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.240
Jesus.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.520
28-inch waist.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.920
28-inch waist.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.080
Jesus Christ!

04:31.120 --> 04:33.120
You could just buy boys clothes when you get home now.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.680
If you have a flap suit, pack it.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
Baby gap, mate.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.680
You could baby gap.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.400
Since arriving on the island,

04:39.440 --> 04:42.440
the men have shed nearly 30 stone between them.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.440
The weight loss was always going to be dramatic,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.760
but I was not expecting it to be as severe as it was.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.680
A maybe just maybe.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.240
The storm has been kind and dropped us a fresh coconut.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.160
Determined to halt the decline,

05:00.200 --> 05:03.080
the men redouble their efforts to find food.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.640
We're going to go and check the shit out of these nets.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.840
Good luck, fellas.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.920
Oh, my leg is just not working today.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.680
I had that yesterday, just...

05:12.720 --> 05:14.800
Have you worn your boots recently?

05:14.840 --> 05:15.400
No.

05:15.480 --> 05:20.040
Oh, God, dude, do not try putting them on, I tell you now.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.360
Huh?

05:21.400 --> 05:24.640
Oh, it's a bit weightier than last time, isn't it?

05:24.680 --> 05:27.400
The fishing nets have been a lifeline for the men,

05:27.440 --> 05:28.880
but as they get weaker,

05:28.920 --> 05:30.640
taking the raft out to check them

05:30.680 --> 05:33.520
has become an increasingly difficult task.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.480
Come on, now, let's have just one or two.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.360
Oh, bollocks.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.320
Little snag.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.080
Oh!

05:43.120 --> 05:44.920
Oh, this is getting annoying now.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.480
Today, there isn't a single fish

05:47.520 --> 05:50.160
to reward Charlie and Piers for their efforts.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.440
You all right?

05:51.480 --> 05:52.800
I think it's dangerous now, actually,

05:52.840 --> 05:54.760
moving these nets, in all honesty.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.720
All of us are just skin and bone,

05:56.760 --> 06:01.120
and it's not really...

06:01.160 --> 06:02.480
I don't think it's safe any more.

06:09.800 --> 06:14.160
We've eaten almost every single coconut on this whole island.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.280
All the ones left are pretty much gone.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.680
They're pretty much rotten.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.040
This was the last little stash I knew about.

06:21.080 --> 06:25.000
Depleted a lot of the limpet stores already, really.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.400
Even the men's once-reliable food sources

06:29.440 --> 06:31.840
appear to be running dry.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.440
We have truly decimated the fish

06:33.480 --> 06:36.920
within three metres of the boundary of this island, haven't we?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.160
24 hours ago, we were...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.840
..conquering this island.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.960
Nets were full of fish.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.320
24 hours later, we're in tatters.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
This could go from bad to worse very easily.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.760
Every single one of these guys is going to have mega low moments.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.560
It's just the reality of being out in the wild,

07:05.600 --> 07:09.320
being tired, being bitten to death, being hungry.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.640
You just have those moments.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.600
And one of the key lessons I've learned is that the pain,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.560
the discomfort, it never lasts forever.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.920
Keep your eyes on the light.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.040
Can I just show you something?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.720
There's something here that you might all want to see.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.720
Where is it?

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Come with me. It's not very far.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.840
It's worth it, Sam.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.160
Is it edible?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
It's good.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.240
I'm taking my knife, just in case.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.360
It's Bear Grylls, isn't it?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.680
And it's a hope as well.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.960
Look at this.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.080
Oh, yeah.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.400
Oh, baby turtle.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.480
It's alive and it's making its way to the beach.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.240
And if there's one,

07:44.240 --> 07:46.200
there's probably a few more.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.200
Isn't that amazing?

07:47.240 --> 07:48.400
That's incredible.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.400
There's the others. Look.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.680
Oh, the other one. Oh, yeah.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.000
Can you see the two of them?

07:52.040 --> 07:52.840
Yeah.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.920
Oh.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.040
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

07:55.080 --> 07:55.920
Privilege.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.720
It's a real privilege, isn't it?

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
I just noticed it.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.920
I was coming back from the end of the beach.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.280
I just saw this thing wriggling in the sand and I thought,

08:04.320 --> 08:05.600
what's that?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.600
And just to see that, it's absolutely amazing.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.520
This is such fire.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.920
You can sort of see them toasting in the sun, can't you?

08:15.960 --> 08:16.920
Yeah.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.120
It's the life and death of these guys, you know what I mean?

08:20.160 --> 08:22.040
It's like each one of us, you know,

08:22.080 --> 08:24.080
whether it's here on this island or in life,

08:24.120 --> 08:27.520
we're sort of fighting our own personal battles.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.560
Should we help him?

08:32.160 --> 08:35.040
Come on, mate. Get out of that hole.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.520
Help him along.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.280
Come on, chap.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
Go.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.360
And maybe I'm doing a completely wrong thing

08:42.400 --> 08:43.320
and...

08:43.520 --> 08:46.880
Shoot me down, but if there's a chance of this little dude

08:46.920 --> 08:49.680
living rather than dying,

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
I want him to live.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.440
Go on, little fella.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.480
Take to the water.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.600
God, that was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.680
Really touching.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.080
Those guys have just been born, they've just been hatched.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.000
All they're thinking about is just surviving.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.360
Getting to that water, it just puts everything into perspective.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.320
Such a beautiful sight.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.920
This is what life is, really.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.520
You OK?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, yeah, tired, that's all.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.040
The turtles have been a welcome distraction,

09:28.080 --> 09:30.520
but after more than five weeks on a starvation diet

09:30.560 --> 09:34.440
and no sign of their next meal, the men are in bad shape.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.400
God.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.360
Tired.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.560
Just tired.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.520
I'm so tired, just tired.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.160
I've usually got lots of energy, and I like being enthusiastic about things.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.560
I like doing things.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.240
But I've been so tired.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.840
I'm sort of starving, wasting away, and I know my body is just like,

09:55.920 --> 09:59.000
you need fuel, but there's no escaping it.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.400
You're so aware that you're going downhill fast.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Are you all right?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.040
No, he's gone, I think.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.680
They're all fucking dying.

10:12.760 --> 10:17.120
On the beach, some of the baby turtles are also on their last legs.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.120
They're just frying up hot little bodies.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.640
I wish they'd woken up at night.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.680
It breaks my heart, but either we leave these little guys to rot

10:28.760 --> 10:31.320
or for the birds to pick at them or we eat them.

10:31.400 --> 10:37.600
And this, by any definition, is a moral dilemma.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.800
Are we definitely boiling these little birds?

10:39.880 --> 10:40.880
Yeah.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
Little buggers up, are we?

10:41.960 --> 10:42.960
What do you think?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
I'm not eating it.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.120
No?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.200
I think it's disgusting.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.840
I think you're all inhumane if you eat them, to be honest.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.040
The turtle who died on the beach, there's rumours of that going in a broth,

10:53.120 --> 10:58.240
and you could say for ethical reasons or whatever,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.160
there's no way I'm drinking any of that at all.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.960
Despite strong feelings in the group, Sam makes a decision.

11:10.040 --> 11:10.200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
I'm going to go to hell for this.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.280
Eat, not eat.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.400
I think we should eat them.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.600
I think these guys are done.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.120
Are they all right?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.160
I've got a hard-boiled egg.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.200
Hates Christ, they're beautiful, aren't they?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.280
Oh, that's wrong.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.640
That is so wrong.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.560
I've eaten some fucked up shit in my time.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.320
This takes a kick.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.920
Salute, my little turtley friends.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.320
Best shell in all?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.440
Yep, every bit.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
Raphael.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.000
Michelangelo.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.400
Is there anyone else claiming these turtles?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.120
Go on, then. Don't be shy.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.600
I'll have two.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.200
Oh, my God, they're good.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.360
They're absolutely stunning.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.080
Are you eating them or not eating them?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.560
I am not eating them, mate.

11:57.640 --> 11:58.600
All right, OK.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.920
Weird how you can feel nothing for a snake or an iguana,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
and baby turtle has died anyway.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.120
It's weird.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.000
Difficult to eat.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.240
But I scoffed them down.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.080
It is quite delicious.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.080
I'm sure it is, but a bizarre principle that I'm sticking to now.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.520
With only half the group able to bring themselves to eat the baby turtles,

12:19.600 --> 12:22.480
they bring little relief to the malnourished men.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.080
It's becoming an experiment in starvation.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.160
It's really tough to keep going when you're so hungry.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.000
And the future looks pretty bleak when it comes to food.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.000
The men have now been living alone on the island for more than five weeks.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.440
It doesn't smell too good.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.520
Oh!

12:42.600 --> 12:43.600
Ah!

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
Fuck!

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
Ah!

12:45.840 --> 12:51.680
Since the demise of their fishing nets, the food situation has become critical.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.160
Resources on our back doorstep have run out.

12:55.240 --> 13:00.160
A handful of dead baby turtles provided a temporary reprieve for some of the men.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
Whoa!

13:03.440 --> 13:06.360
But today they're back to nothing.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.200
About a week ago, we saw a baby turtle.

13:09.200 --> 13:14.040
We saw pig-trotter marks, and we're keen to lay some pig traps.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.600
And hopefully, we'll be able to bring back the bacon.

13:18.640 --> 13:22.520
When you're deprived of food, it literally becomes all-consuming.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.000
It's all you think about.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.120
It's all that motivates and drives you, I need something.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.560
But hard though it is when they're running on empty,

13:29.640 --> 13:32.880
the men can't afford to neglect the other survival essentials

13:32.960 --> 13:38.200
they've worked so hard to maintain over five weeks, especially team spirit.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.720
We're on of the most draneling Chuck Santiago brothers

13:41.800 --> 13:43.120
Because I'm trying to find what they could get.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Come on, chefs.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.360
That chap's is delicious.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.800
Is that the obligatory pubic hair?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.040
After an unsuccessful morning,

14:00.120 --> 14:04.160
the only meal the hunting party have been able to muster is limpet broth,

14:04.240 --> 14:06.560
which is quickly devoured by the men.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.600
Mm.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.600
MMM!

14:09.200 --> 14:11.800
I think Phil's the biggest fool.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.560
What have I missed?

14:13.560 --> 14:15.360
The group's oldest member, Phil,

14:15.360 --> 14:18.120
has arrived back in camp later than the others.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.600
We all served up the food

14:22.600 --> 14:24.480
and completely forgot about Phil.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.840
What are you doing?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
Is there any driveway?

14:30.840 --> 14:33.000
That'd be a negative.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.320
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna hide behind my T-shirt.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.160
Wow.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.160
I know that he doesn't sit on it.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.160
Does he need more than water now that he's...

14:43.160 --> 14:46.200
It's the first time since the men arrived on the island

14:46.200 --> 14:48.720
that they have forgotten to feed one of their own.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.840
Everyone looked after themselves and forgot me.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.520
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.960
That's OK. It just means that you all owe me.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.960
That's all.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.160
So, we weren't acting like this four weeks into the experiment,

15:06.160 --> 15:07.120
but now we are...

15:07.120 --> 15:08.880
We're coming up to five and a half weeks

15:08.880 --> 15:14.000
and a lot of people are starting to fray around the edges.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.440
Some of them are fraying.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.160
Some of them are coming away at the seams.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.560
She didn't hear me.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.280
What's he doing now?

15:21.280 --> 15:22.760
I don't know.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.520
He's wondering now.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.720
I don't know.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.200
Have you completely lost it?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.040
I don't believe so.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.240
I miss Phil.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.800
OK, finally, let's get the fuck out of here.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.120
That's it.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.240
Enjoy.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.440
We'll see you later on, mate.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.120
Desperate for a decent meal

15:47.120 --> 15:50.080
and having exhausted the resources close to camp,

15:50.080 --> 15:53.680
Sam Brown and Kyle head off to look further afield.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.960
Now we can go get some coconuts.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.240
Fingers crossed.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.440
For the first time,

15:58.440 --> 16:01.800
they're heading to the unexplored south side of the island,

16:01.800 --> 16:06.000
an arduous five-kilometre round trip across unforgiving terrain.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.360
Having set off at 4pm,

16:09.360 --> 16:13.000
they have just two hours to make it there and back before nightfall.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.400
We might have left this slightly late.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.360
Guys, there's an iguana here.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
Where is it?

16:24.360 --> 16:26.200
In the remaining hours of daylight,

16:26.200 --> 16:30.000
the other men are doing their best to find a meal closer to home.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.040
Where is it?

16:31.040 --> 16:33.400
It's in the fucking tree here. I'm pointing to it.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.200
We're in a fucking forest. It's twirling.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.200
It's a tree.

16:36.200 --> 16:36.800
It's a tree.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.480
12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, where are you standing?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.000
Wow.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.760
Fractures occurring in the group.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.240
Wee arguments, bickering.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.960
And that's got to be down to the hunger and the tiredness.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.320
We haven't got a fucking clue where it is.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.800
It's... I mean, can everyone see me?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.520
If you can see me, I'm pointing at it.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.400
Where is it?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.920
It's down towards you, Barney. Barney, Barney.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.000
It's going that way. It's going that way.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.920
Yeah, I know. He's gone.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.360
Back.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.360
Bollocks.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.040
MUSIC PLAYS

17:04.040 --> 17:05.920
MUSIC FADES

17:05.920 --> 17:07.200
So are you struggling a bit, today?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.920
Yeah, today has been a tough day, actually.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.640
Sam and Kyle have now been trekking through dense jungle

17:13.640 --> 17:16.560
for more than an hour...

17:16.560 --> 17:19.280
..in an attempt to find out if the island's south coast

17:19.280 --> 17:21.680
has any untapped sources of food.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.040
Slippy as buggery here, Kyle, just be careful.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.360
Cheers, mate.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.800
This is going to be a fucking nightmare on the way back.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.600
Thanks for that beat, chocolate.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.920
Mate, be careful. Be careful, be careful.

17:34.920 --> 17:35.240
Be careful! Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful, mate!"

17:35.240 --> 17:36.240
Be careful.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.600
This is a no-go.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.080
We were hoping to find a nice sandy beach and a coconut tree.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.440
Instead...

17:53.840 --> 17:54.840
..we find this.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.760
Fucking lethal.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.800
One slip up here and we'll die.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.240
We'll die.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.080
On the other side of the island,

18:14.080 --> 18:17.040
farmer Charlie is the first to return to camp

18:17.040 --> 18:18.840
after a fruitless day's hunting.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.560
Oh, fucking hell!

18:23.840 --> 18:28.520
I've come back to find the fire down to about one square inch of embers

18:28.520 --> 18:31.320
after a month of constant burn.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.920
We're getting a bit complacent now.

18:33.920 --> 18:34.920
How much water's left?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.240
I don't know.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.240
Oh, no.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.240
You can see the standards of the camp are going lower and lower

18:45.240 --> 18:48.240
because people are just starting not to give a shit any more.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.240
Kept this fire going for a month now.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.240
There was no smoke coming out of that whatsoever.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.240
There was an ember about an inch square.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.240
But it was either, yeah, Barney, Phil, Roscoe...

19:01.240 --> 19:03.240
That's not point fingers, it's not helpful.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.480
..just saying it was either.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
One of you five.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.240
It cannot happen again.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.240
Most of the group have now been back at camp for the past hour,

19:15.240 --> 19:18.240
but Sam and Kyle have yet to return from their expedition

19:18.240 --> 19:20.240
to the south of the island.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.240
Are we worried about them, lads?

19:22.240 --> 19:24.240
It's now pitch black.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.240
It is, isn't it? Yeah.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.240
It's not the ideal time to be out foraging.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.240
My worry is, when you're in the middle of the jungle, in the dark...

19:30.240 --> 19:32.240
Yeah, you've got no navigation.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.240
You've got a high tide as well, so you can't even get round.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.240
This is the first time any of the men have failed

19:38.240 --> 19:40.240
to get back to camp before dark.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.240
With the weather worsening

19:45.240 --> 19:48.240
and concerns growing over Sam and Kyle's safety,

19:48.240 --> 19:51.240
the men muster a search party.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.240
Let's go. Let's try and find them.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.240
Ideal.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.240
Fucking sure we're going out at four o'clock.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.240
Yeah, they're certainly not equipped for a night out

20:01.240 --> 20:03.240
in the fucking jungle on their own.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

20:04.240 --> 20:06.240
It's a very steep drop down here.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
Sam!

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
Kyle!

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
Sam!

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
Kyle!

20:21.240 --> 20:23.240
It's not looking good, man.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.240
They would not find us here. Not a chance.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.240
This is Kyle and Sam in the dark,

20:30.240 --> 20:33.240
trying to trek back towards our camp.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.240
We'll see how far we get.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.240
With no sun in the sky, it's hard to get your bearings.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.240
Really, really unforgiving terrain.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Charlie!

20:47.240 --> 20:48.240
Charlie!

20:48.240 --> 20:50.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

20:51.240 --> 20:52.240
Sam!

20:53.240 --> 20:54.240
Try the bird.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

20:56.240 --> 20:57.240
Oh, fuck.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.240
This is fucking stupid.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
I feel tormented out here.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
Come on, boys!

21:03.240 --> 21:04.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

21:04.240 --> 21:05.240
SAM!

21:05.240 --> 21:06.240
Kyle!

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

21:07.240 --> 21:09.240
Having searched for an hour with no sign of the missing pair,

21:09.240 --> 21:11.240
the group reluctantly head back to camp.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.240
WHISTLE BLOWS

21:12.240 --> 21:14.240
Truth's known you want to get them and give them a clip

21:14.240 --> 21:16.240
for being so stupid and putting us all through this

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
because the only thing they can do is have a look at the dog.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
The dog is a dog.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.240
Oh, my God.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.240
Oh, my God.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.240
Oh, my God.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
Oh, my God.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
Oh, my God.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
Oh, my God.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
Oh, my God.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.240
Oh, my God.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.240
Oh, my God.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
Oh, my God.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.240
Oh, my God.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.240
Oh, my God.

21:31.240 --> 21:37.800
because the only thing we are going to be thinking now all night is how they say how are they i hope

21:37.800 --> 21:42.840
they're okay familiarization makes you think that we've got it licked yeah that's what we've done

21:42.840 --> 21:47.320
we ain't got nothing licked have we not mother nature in this island and bite you whenever she

21:47.320 --> 22:02.520
feels fit oh four rocks oh yeah desperately trying to get back to camp sam and kyle have

22:02.520 --> 22:07.960
hit the treacherous stretch of coast where will had his accident this is getting dangerous

22:08.840 --> 22:11.800
one wrong move here could easily prove fatal

22:14.600 --> 22:15.880
now this next bit

22:17.720 --> 22:20.120
you have to take it really really slow because

22:20.840 --> 22:24.200
it's slippy as hell in the boulders and we've only got one head torch between us

22:25.640 --> 22:27.960
i am genuinely shedding myself now

22:40.840 --> 22:42.920
i genuinely don't think that they know where they are

22:46.040 --> 22:47.240
it's a bit eerie actually

22:47.320 --> 22:51.800
sometimes maybe i've seen one too many horror films i didn't think i was scared

22:51.800 --> 22:55.960
of the dark but out here you have to sort of steal yourself that you're not scared of the dark

22:58.280 --> 23:01.720
hello i see a light boys

23:09.720 --> 23:15.240
sam good to see you man we are so pleased that you're back i don't think i've ever been so

23:15.800 --> 23:22.840
massively relieved in my whole life well done boys glad to have you all well done boys

23:22.840 --> 23:30.200
well done boys my pleasure the two prodigal sons returned thank god they're back home safe and sound

23:30.200 --> 23:35.560
the other side of the island is just horrible it's all sheer cliff yeah the waves hitting it like

23:36.280 --> 23:41.800
it's going to sit down sorry listen sorry to keep you guys up for so long anyone but we got back

23:41.800 --> 23:45.160
that's what counts well the past few days have taken the whole island off its way into the sea

23:45.160 --> 23:49.840
whole group really to their limits both physically and mentally not only have

23:49.840 --> 23:53.680
they forgotten to feed people and neglected the essential tasks of fire

23:53.680 --> 23:58.680
and water but their recklessness brought the group close to losing two more men

23:58.680 --> 24:03.660
if they don't start looking after each other thinking smart being resourceful

24:03.660 --> 24:09.040
and surviving then got a cat's chance the whole thing for me all comes down

24:09.040 --> 24:13.840
to that's getting complacent yeah about everything thinking that we're we're now

24:13.840 --> 24:18.080
starting to own this island a little bit when really we have shit we took

24:18.080 --> 24:23.440
control that comes down to slipping off rocks running out of wood which will

24:23.440 --> 24:27.500
blatantly do tomorrow yeah whatever it may be let's just get our drills a

24:27.500 --> 24:31.480
little bit back in order yeah let's get back with morning morning calls and

24:31.480 --> 24:34.280
stuff like that let's get back into them because we're all fucking show you the

24:34.280 --> 24:37.940
minute so let's get the basics right yeah it would be vulgar to finish in

24:37.940 --> 24:43.520
such a weak way we are here and we have grown so close together that we go for

24:43.520 --> 24:43.600
it

24:43.840 --> 24:48.640
doing the things we want to do that are exciting and fulfill all them things

24:48.640 --> 24:53.020
we've always wanted to whip since being here let's go for it let's do this chaps

24:53.020 --> 24:59.800
come on I don't want to finish week when I finish strong catch some pigs catch

24:59.800 --> 25:05.200
some animals finish this adventure the way we want to I'm not going out like a

25:05.200 --> 25:09.280
wet fart I want to go out strong

25:12.280 --> 25:13.520
mum and dad

25:13.840 --> 25:25.460
there's so much I want to tell you because I just wanted to say being here

25:27.960 --> 25:32.900
has made me realize just how much I love you all

25:33.400 --> 25:38.240
I don't want you to be worried about me in any sense and the reason I'm being

25:38.240 --> 25:43.720
kind of a little bit nearly tearful it's because I just can't wait for the next

25:43.720 --> 25:45.320
for that moment to see you all.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.640
But I'm having the time of my life.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.480
I really am.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.160
I hope, I hope, it's off to a good go.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.380
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.340
Early morning.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.720
After a difficult day yesterday,

26:07.720 --> 26:10.500
the men are determined to redouble their efforts

26:10.500 --> 26:12.420
and leave the island on a high.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.420
I'm amazed what washes up on these damn beaches.

26:15.420 --> 26:16.580
A snake.

26:16.580 --> 26:17.680
Should I get a machete?

26:18.760 --> 26:19.680
Nice shot.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.600
Come on.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.960
It's so funny, because on day one,

26:21.960 --> 26:24.080
we would be like, oh shit, there's a snake.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.540
And now we're like, oh, it's just another snake.

26:26.540 --> 26:27.380
Roar!

26:30.800 --> 26:33.420
Today, I really got a sense that our teamwork,

26:33.420 --> 26:35.720
our team ethic really came back.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.660
It just seems to be a real pulling together today.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.080
Woo!

26:44.080 --> 26:45.680
Man, he caught a whopper.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.540
We've got fish!

26:47.540 --> 26:49.380
Holy shit!

26:51.380 --> 26:52.880
Hello, hello, hello.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.720
Oh, what a night.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.540
Oh, that is it.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.920
It's a beauty as well.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.800
Never in my life have I made my own sashimi before.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.420
I've gone from eating one fish maybe every six months

27:05.420 --> 27:10.180
to now having it raw on a beach, on a home-whittled table,

27:10.180 --> 27:11.300
and loving it.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.340
Dig in. To you, sir.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.340
To many, to many more days like this.

27:18.960 --> 27:19.800
Oh.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.080
Mm.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.840
That is just so...

27:24.840 --> 27:26.420
Succulent in the justice, does it?

27:26.420 --> 27:27.260
Fresh.

27:28.540 --> 27:29.380
It's delicious.

27:30.620 --> 27:32.420
One of the things I want to see in this experiment

27:32.420 --> 27:35.720
is whether these guys can use all their collective resources

27:35.720 --> 27:38.500
and brains and muscles to not just survive,

27:38.500 --> 27:41.720
but to really thrive, to build community,

27:41.720 --> 27:47.220
to have fun, to work out efficient sources of finding food,

27:47.220 --> 27:49.720
to, you know, to really start to thrive

27:49.720 --> 27:52.920
and separate us from the animals.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.640
When Oinky makes his way to my front door,

27:55.640 --> 27:58.720
I will consume the entire fucking animal.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.640
The men's renewed spirit has brought fresh optimism

28:02.640 --> 28:05.260
about the prospect of catching a meatier meal.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.480
Ah.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.600
What have we got here?

28:11.720 --> 28:14.720
These look like little trotter mack's to me.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
Oh, my fucking God.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.720
That is exciting, isn't it?

28:18.720 --> 28:20.720
We're going in the bushes, so, obviously,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.720
it's a bit too hot for them, and then going back in.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.720
They're definite pig trunks.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.720
Please.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.720
Oh, my God, bacon patties.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.720
Oh!

28:31.720 --> 28:33.720
We were all fantasising the other day

28:33.720 --> 28:35.720
about what we're going to do to Oinky.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
Delusions of grandeur, of smoking him,

28:37.720 --> 28:40.720
and putting him on a spit, and having crackling, and...

28:40.720 --> 28:43.720
God knows all sorts what we'd give for that.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.720
Damn, it's warm, Barney.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.720
It's getting hot, mate, isn't it, eh? Yeah.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.720
Further down the beach,

28:49.720 --> 28:51.720
Vik, Barney and the two Sams

28:51.720 --> 28:53.720
are also on the hunt for a decent supper.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.720
Shit the dog. Shit the dog.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.720
What? Look at that. Look at that.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.720
There's something there. Stop, stop, stop. Don't move.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
Where, where, where? OK, stop.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.720
Black pig, black pig. There's a pig in there. No way.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.720
Don't move, don't move. Vik, Vik, don't move.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.720
Let's have a think about this. OK.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.720
He was just having a little snooze in the shade,

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
so we need to get behind him,

29:13.720 --> 29:15.720
cos he's going to disappear straight in there.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.720
I'll go up the sand. I'll go with you, then, yeah? Yeah.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.720
Don't you worry. We'll hold him down.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.720
If I'm eating pig tonight, I'll fight the bastards.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.720
Just keep very calm.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.720
When cornered, pigs can be incredibly aggressive animals.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.720
This thing is going to run like stink.

29:31.720 --> 29:35.720
They've got razor-sharp tusks and a vicious bite.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.720
I'll go up to him and then...

30:04.720 --> 30:05.720
There's a pig.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.720
There's an other pig.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.720
No!

30:09.720 --> 30:12.120
Get in!

30:12.160 --> 30:15.040
Holy shit, Barney! Sorry, Barney!

30:15.080 --> 30:17.280
Woo!

30:17.320 --> 30:18.520
Woo!

30:18.560 --> 30:20.680
I thought he was going to turn and bite me. I crapped myself.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.320
Yeah, he's gone.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.880
Gosh, that was so much quicker than I thought.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.000
That was just like...

30:28.040 --> 30:30.080
Listen, it's done. This is how we roll.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.840
I wasn't expecting you to stab him.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.760
I didn't expect you to stab him at all.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.040
I did. Mate, that would kill you.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.520
That would hurt. That would fuck you up.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.840
Yeah.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.560
This is a fucking adult pig.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.880
This is like a hog, isn't it?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.240
These things wreck people.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.000
Jesus, look at that tusk.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.760
That would go through to bone, wouldn't it?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.000
Oh, yeah.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.920
Six weeks ago, I would have been very slow to draw a knife

30:53.960 --> 30:55.600
and ram it into a large mammal's throat.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.440
Now, I didn't even think, I didn't even hesitate.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.160
Oh, easy peasy.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.560
OK. Yeah.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.960
Oh, there's going to be so much meat on that head.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.680
In 21st century Britain,

31:06.720 --> 31:07.960
I think we're so used to getting

31:07.960 --> 31:11.680
all of our meat pre-packaged off a supermarket shelf.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.040
And in many ways, we've kind of lost touch

31:14.080 --> 31:15.680
with actually where it comes from.

31:15.720 --> 31:20.480
Meat on his legs, ribs, back legs, a lot.

31:20.520 --> 31:24.040
Many people understand we find the whole idea of killing an animal,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.920
they find it either cruel or definitely upsetting.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.960
And, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,

31:29.000 --> 31:32.200
but in a survival situation, when it comes down to it,

31:32.240 --> 31:33.640
it's a simple choice.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.200
Them or you.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.280
Nose to tail,

31:37.280 --> 31:39.960
we're going to eat every piece of you, Mr Pig.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.720
I can see home from here, boys.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.560
I don't believe it.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.400
I don't believe it. It cannot be a trotter.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.400
Woo!

31:47.440 --> 31:48.720
Boys!

31:48.760 --> 31:50.720
Ain't done this thing, eh?

31:52.600 --> 31:53.840
Yes.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.320
Well done, boys.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.880
OK, three, two, one, go.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.200
Oh, Mr Piggy.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.240
That was hard work.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.280
Yeah?

32:03.320 --> 32:06.120
And you've already got me big, good in there.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.080
Oh, that is great.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.640
Absolutely brilliant, isn't it?

32:08.680 --> 32:10.000
Yeah, get in there.

32:10.040 --> 32:14.840
A pig of this size, weighing up to 200 pounds,

32:14.880 --> 32:17.600
contains tens of thousands of calories

32:17.640 --> 32:20.520
and could feed the ten men for the next few days.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.960
I think there's a lung there.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.320
Yeah, you don't want to eat lung.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.600
Oh, we're going to have pork belly.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.480
God, that is like barbecue food.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.200
Yeah.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.400
Has anybody got any preference about who's served first today?

32:35.440 --> 32:36.880
I would say Phil.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.600
Yeah, great job, good luck.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.840
After the group forgot to feed Phil yesterday,

32:41.880 --> 32:46.320
by way of an apology, they give him first dibs on the spoils.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.040
I'm having a meat orgasm.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.960
Which one's the kidney?

32:52.000 --> 32:55.800
Anyone that knows me will know one of my favourite meals is liver and bacon.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.000
Guess what that is?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.040
Liver.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.200
Oh.

33:05.200 --> 33:09.240
And then to add to that, kidney.

33:14.680 --> 33:19.560
That beats any crocodile, any fish, anything I've had on this island.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.120
I don't know what you're saying.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.280
The pig is the men's first taste of meat in weeks

33:25.320 --> 33:28.080
and nothing is going to waste.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.680
I think that's testicle-y.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.840
I'm going to eat everything of this pig.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.040
I'm even going to eat it.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.160
It's little Willy.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.760
I'd eat some pig penis.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.480
That's a very unique flavour in there.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.840
Does that taste like dick?

33:42.880 --> 33:45.560
Yeah. Yeah, it is dick.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.240
It worries me quite a lot that you know what dicks taste like.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.880
Vic! Yeah?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.480
I think we're raising the sign, mate.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.520
After surviving on the island for almost six weeks,

34:02.560 --> 34:04.560
the men have decided to make a tribute

34:04.560 --> 34:06.000
to their achievement.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.640
Gentlemen, by the power invested in me,

34:09.680 --> 34:14.640
I name this camp the Croc and Trotter.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.120
The Croc and Trotter!

34:24.120 --> 34:26.080
I'm really looking forward to this ending

34:26.120 --> 34:28.000
and looking back and just saying,

34:28.040 --> 34:30.040
wow, I did that.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.080
I accomplished...

34:34.560 --> 34:37.560
I succeeded.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.240
We conquered the island.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.120
We're named and ready to rock.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.840
Shall we play toss the caber?

34:47.880 --> 34:48.960
Yeah!

34:49.000 --> 34:50.520
First game, let's go.

34:50.560 --> 34:54.160
Three, a two, a one, toss my caber.

34:54.200 --> 34:55.960
Come on, Charlie.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.480
Man!

34:57.520 --> 35:00.040
Oh, no!

35:00.080 --> 35:01.600
That's it!

35:01.640 --> 35:02.680
Go!

35:02.720 --> 35:03.640
Yay!

35:03.680 --> 35:04.360
One!

35:04.360 --> 35:05.360
Not bad, son!

35:05.400 --> 35:06.360
Not bad!

35:06.400 --> 35:07.360
Yeah!

35:07.400 --> 35:09.280
It's the first time that the whole group,

35:09.320 --> 35:10.680
as we let our hair down,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.440
are not worried about water or wood or survival

35:13.480 --> 35:15.120
or will we eat or will we not.

35:15.160 --> 35:18.400
It's kind of like, let's just get together as lads and have fun.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.880
I wish, looking back, I wish we'd done more of it.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.400
That's one of the highlights of our entire time here.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.480
Oh!

35:25.520 --> 35:26.480
Beautiful!

35:26.520 --> 35:27.480
Go, go, go, go, Vic!

35:27.520 --> 35:28.480
No, Charlie!

35:28.520 --> 35:29.480
Oh, no!

35:29.520 --> 35:30.480
Oh, no, no!

35:30.520 --> 35:31.480
Oh, no!

35:31.520 --> 35:32.480
Oh, yes!

35:32.520 --> 35:33.480
One nil!

35:33.520 --> 35:34.160
Yes!

35:34.160 --> 35:36.440
What I have experienced many times in the wild

35:36.480 --> 35:38.560
is an incredible sense of achievement

35:38.600 --> 35:41.160
that is very hard to get in everyday life.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
Catch it!

35:42.240 --> 35:43.320
Oh!

35:43.360 --> 35:46.600
And I think when you battle for seven or eight hours

35:46.640 --> 35:50.280
in a torrential rainstorm with just a couple of sticks to make a fire,

35:50.320 --> 35:54.200
you've got to look for opportunities, however small, to have fun.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.600
Yeah!

35:55.640 --> 35:59.720
It's almost like nourishment, but for the soul.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.560
Take the string!

36:00.600 --> 36:02.200
Take the string!

36:02.240 --> 36:03.200
Yes!

36:04.160 --> 36:05.520
Call it a draw!

36:05.560 --> 36:06.520
A draw, yeah!

36:06.560 --> 36:07.560
A draw!

36:07.600 --> 36:10.320
I feel amazing.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.560
I feel relaxed, I feel empowered,

36:14.600 --> 36:19.120
I feel like we're masters of this island.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.840
I'll treasure this moment.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.080
I really, really will.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.760
This is what the island's all about.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.080
This and a handful of other moments.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.040
This feeling.

36:33.080 --> 36:33.480
I hope we'll get to see it.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.480
I hope I never forget it.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.480
Well, here we are.

36:39.480 --> 36:44.480
We are at the end of this magnificent, magnificent journey.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.480
Overwhelming sadness that I miss my wife and kids so much.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.480
Not so much sadness, just,

36:50.480 --> 36:53.480
God, how long can this truly go on for?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.480
Er...

36:56.480 --> 37:00.480
Yeah, I'd like to see them soon, if possible.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.480
Some of it better for me, some of it better.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.480
What do you think of that beauty?

37:12.480 --> 37:14.480
Shit. There it goes.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.480
Look, look, look.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.480
Ooh, there's some heat off this bad boy.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.480
Look at this!

37:20.480 --> 37:22.480
Look at that goal!

37:22.480 --> 37:24.480
Didn't take long, did it?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.480
Ocean's Elevenses.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.480
This is our last night on the island.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
Yeah!

37:30.480 --> 37:31.480
Yes!

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
Yes!

37:32.480 --> 37:33.480
Yes!

37:33.480 --> 37:34.480
Yes!

37:34.480 --> 37:35.480
Yes!

37:35.480 --> 37:36.480
Good!

37:36.480 --> 37:38.480
Best night so far?

37:38.480 --> 37:39.480
I think so.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
Has to be, doesn't it?

37:41.480 --> 37:42.480
Awesome.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.480
Love it.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.480
Home's within spitting distance.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.480
Really enjoying it.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.480
Everyone's spirits are really high.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
Wow.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.480
The men have now survived on the island for 40 days.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.480
Would you guys like to hear a little Ravi Varan's poem that I wrote this morning?

37:58.480 --> 37:59.480
I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.480
I would love to hear Ravi Varan's poem.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
Yes, I'd love to.

38:02.480 --> 38:10.480
Dear islands, our islands, this new family does hail.

38:10.480 --> 38:15.480
As you've chucked every last, but nobody has failed.

38:15.480 --> 38:19.480
On the contrary, dear islands, as our stay grew longer,

38:19.480 --> 38:21.480
we may have reduced in numbers.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
Holy shit!

38:22.480 --> 38:26.480
But we've grown ever stronger.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.480
For six long weeks,

38:28.480 --> 38:31.480
we've battled hunger, tides, exhaustion, the weather.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.480
But with British Bulldog spirit,

38:34.480 --> 38:36.480
She floats!

38:36.480 --> 38:39.480
we triumphed with heart, soul and endeavour.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.480
Holy shit!

38:42.480 --> 38:47.480
You've been cruel, uncomfortable and brutal to us all.

38:48.480 --> 38:52.480
With freezing rain, dangerous seas and rocks that make us fall.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.480
Holy shit!

38:53.480 --> 38:57.480
You have dangerous beasts that can kill, maim and maul.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.480
This is a scorpion.

39:00.480 --> 39:04.480
But we baited, trapped, killed, cooked and ate them all.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.480
Oh, delicious. So good.

39:07.480 --> 39:12.480
But dear islands, our islands, we will never forget

39:12.480 --> 39:17.480
the incredible journey we've shared since our new family met.

39:18.480 --> 39:22.480
So the question is, our islands, can British blokes survive?

39:22.480 --> 39:24.480
Get the fucking camera off!

39:24.480 --> 39:27.480
The answer is no, dear islands.

39:28.480 --> 39:31.480
We didn't just survive, but thrive.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.480
Excellent.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.480
Oh, my God, look at her go!

39:43.480 --> 39:44.480
Wow!

39:58.480 --> 40:04.480
So I'm on my way to pick up the men after six weeks, you know,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.480
and to be honest, I'm pretty nervous just about what I'm going to find.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.480
You know, are they going to be emaciated wrecks

40:10.480 --> 40:12.480
or are they going to look pretty healthy?

40:12.480 --> 40:14.480
You know, are they going to be broken men

40:14.480 --> 40:17.480
or will they have figured out how to survive and thrive?

40:19.480 --> 40:20.480
It is quite strange, though, isn't it?

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
What bit?

40:21.480 --> 40:22.480
It's finished.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.480
Yeah, yeah.

40:23.480 --> 40:27.480
Within an hour, we'll step off and never be able to get out.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.480
We'll step off and never, ever step back on.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.480
For it has been an honour serving you, gentlemen.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.480
Yes, see you here.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.480
Good effort, gents.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.480
I feel quite proud of our little gang.

40:37.480 --> 40:41.480
The island has taught me an incredible sense of unity

40:41.480 --> 40:45.480
and we've shared, we've shared everything that we've had here on this island.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.480
It doesn't matter if it was the smallest fish,

40:47.480 --> 40:49.480
we've shared it between everyone.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.480
I feel...

40:54.480 --> 40:56.480
..thrilled to have made it this far

40:56.480 --> 40:58.480
with you all.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.480
It sounds fucked up,

41:00.480 --> 41:03.480
but I feel like I'm going to actually miss you lot.

41:03.480 --> 41:08.480
I think I'm leaving the island with a renewed sense of confidence

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
and some friends.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.480
Some more friends, should I say.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.480
Here we go, boys.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.480
Don't worry.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.480
Here he is.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.480
Yes!

41:20.480 --> 41:21.480
Come on, lads.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
This is our man.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.480
This is it, lads.

41:25.480 --> 41:26.480
It's Bear Grylls.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.480
Very good, lads.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.480
It's only Bear Bloody Grylls.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.480
It's only Bloody Dunnets.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.480
It's only Bloody Dunnets!

41:33.480 --> 41:34.480
Bloody Dunnets!

41:38.480 --> 41:39.480
Wow.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.480
Look at you guys.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.480
I thought I smelled bad.

41:42.480 --> 41:44.480
I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.480
Yeah, glad to see you.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.480
Thanks for coming back.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.480
I'm glad I made it to the end.

41:49.480 --> 41:53.480
I am super, super, super glad I made it to the end.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.480
Well done, you guys.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.480
Wow.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.480
It's like you've been through a war zone.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.480
But those smiles tell a story.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.480
So how are you feeling?

42:01.480 --> 42:02.480
Fantastic.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
Glad to see you now.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
Yeah.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.480
Glad to see you.

42:06.480 --> 42:11.480
As a band of brothers, it's not a band of brothers anymore.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.480
It's a family.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.480
Love them and hate them.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.480
They're here forever with you.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.480
And it was fantastic.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.480
So we're going to get you off the island.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.480
One last thing you guys want to do?

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
Yes.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.480
Woo!

42:23.480 --> 42:24.480
Come on, boys.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.480
Come on, guys.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.480
Kyle, you started this fire.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.480
You tell us when to end it, pal.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.480
I'm proud to say that I've made it here with you guys.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.480
Ocean's 11ters.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.480
Let's quench the fire.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
Quench the fire, guys.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.480
Woo!

42:38.480 --> 42:40.480
Woo!

42:40.480 --> 42:41.480
Woo!

42:41.480 --> 42:42.480
Woo!

42:42.480 --> 42:43.480
Woo!

42:43.480 --> 42:44.480
Woo!

42:44.480 --> 42:45.480
Woo!

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
Woo!

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
Woo!

42:47.480 --> 42:48.480
Woo!

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
Woo!

42:49.480 --> 42:50.480
Woo!

42:50.480 --> 42:51.480
Woo!

42:51.480 --> 42:52.480
Woo!

42:52.480 --> 42:53.480
Woo!

42:53.480 --> 42:54.480
Woo!

42:54.480 --> 42:55.480
Woo!

42:55.480 --> 42:56.480
Woo!

42:56.480 --> 42:57.480
Woo!

42:57.480 --> 42:58.480
Woo!

42:58.480 --> 42:59.480
Woo!

42:59.480 --> 43:00.480
Woo!

43:00.480 --> 43:01.480
Woo!

43:01.480 --> 43:02.480
Woo!

43:02.480 --> 43:03.480
Woo!

43:03.480 --> 43:04.480
Woo!

43:04.480 --> 43:05.480
Woo!

43:05.480 --> 43:06.480
Woo!

43:06.480 --> 43:07.480
Woo!

43:07.480 --> 43:08.480
Woo!

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
Woo!

43:09.480 --> 43:10.480
Get in there.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
Yes?

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
I think what's interesting is that you realize they've actually

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
become a really tight unit.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.480
You know, that's why there's emotion at the end when they're

43:15.480 --> 43:17.480
hugging each other, because they've been through the fire

43:17.480 --> 43:19.480
together, and have come out of it stronger.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
Well done, boys.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
Let's go, boys.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
Let's go, boys.

43:22.480 --> 43:31.820
If I got that chance again, give me about a year or half a year, I'll do it again.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.240
But if you ask me to do it tomorrow, I'll probably tell you to piss off.

43:46.040 --> 43:50.860
Just because you're over 40, just because you're over 50, just because you're almost 60, doesn't mean you're spent.

43:52.480 --> 43:55.380
A can-do attitude goes a long way in this life.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.780
Is that Will? Is that Will?

44:14.280 --> 44:14.940
That's William!

44:19.940 --> 44:21.300
That's him in this!

44:22.480 --> 44:34.160
Oh, that's so good.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.280
Wow, you all stink!

44:38.100 --> 44:40.780
I couldn't let you guys get to the end without me.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.160
Hello, is that you?

44:52.480 --> 44:54.900
Hi, I'm fine, you?

44:59.020 --> 45:00.660
It's absolutely brilliant, babe.

45:01.020 --> 45:02.540
Oh God, your voice is beautiful.

45:04.640 --> 45:05.200
Hello?

45:05.600 --> 45:05.840
Hello?

45:07.680 --> 45:08.240
Hello?

45:13.240 --> 45:14.460
Is that Bobby?

45:15.200 --> 45:15.800
Yeah.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.740
Oh, Bobby!

45:18.740 --> 45:21.400
Bobby, I need to hear from you.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.040
It'sông

45:24.040 --> 45:33.320
It's provided a look at overall.

45:33.320 --> 45:38.220
You know, they've built community, they have learnt have compassionate and a care for each other.

45:38.220 --> 45:40.880
A respect for each other, they've worked their nuts off.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.880
They've understood the heart of survival isn't about knowledge.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.720
It's about embracing failure, making mistakes and never giving up.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.900
And that's why, at the end of it, what I've done is inspiring.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.360
they've gone through a journey together and come out of it stronger tighter and

45:57.360 --> 46:03.300
it's why they've learned the beginning of a mastery over this environment

46:03.300 --> 46:08.580
they can call themselves survivors they've earned it the hard way

46:22.480 --> 46:24.540
you
