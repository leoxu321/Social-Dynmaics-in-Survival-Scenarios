00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Six weeks ago, I set out to discover whether 14 ordinary British men

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and 14 ordinary British women could do something extraordinary.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Survive on two remote Pacific islands...

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
..filled with dangerous wildlife...

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That is a big fucker.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It came right at me!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
..at the height of the tropical storm season.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How on earth are we expected to survive in this?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What I want to find out is, has all of this cushioning

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that civilisation has experienced over the last 50 years

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that I believe is deep within us all?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In this groundbreaking experiment,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the castaways faced surviving entirely alone for six weeks.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Holy shit!

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Tonight, I discover how both the islands fared.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're really on more than nature, I say.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll reveal and explain the techniques

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that men and women use to survive...

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
..find out how island life affected them...

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am not the same person who went to the island.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's the best thing I've ever done.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
..and what it was like when they returned to civilisation.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh!

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What the hell's going on?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Showered and everything!

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No way!

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's absolutely brilliant, babe.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
After 41 days, I returned to the islands

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to find out how the castaways have stayed alive

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
using only their wits

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and some basic survival skills.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is it him?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Such a big part of me is so relieved

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we've reached this point where we're extracting them.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is the most in-depth experiment I've ever done.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Six weeks, height of a rainy season.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Brutal.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Welcome!

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wow, look at you guys.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well done.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well done, you.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Done.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Amazing.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Genuinely.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think what's interesting about doing two separate islands,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
one for the men, one for the women,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is seeing how two very different groups of people

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
cope in the same hardships.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Look at you guys.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I thought I smelled bad.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work, isn't it?

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Success!

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the smell of success.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thanks for coming back.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's have a look at the camp.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We would like to introduce you to the Croc and Trotter,

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
which is the name of our camp.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Guys, this looks incredible.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's all right, isn't it?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You know, this is like out of a movie set, Robinson Crusoe.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So with this sign here,

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think this is like a symbol of how far we've come.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it's no longer a camp, but it's now our home.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sounds a bit like a pub.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yep.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Correct!

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's what we're doing.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I discovered they'd constructed a fire pit and seating area,

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
a communal table,

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and individual raised beds...

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
..that even built themselves a staircase.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Because of the torrential rain, that hill was treacherous,

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
so one of the first things we did is,

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
while everyone else basically built the shelter,

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I built the steps.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You know, little things like that

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
where you're trying to conserve energy.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As a team, we definitely thrived, no doubt about it.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I mean, you only have to go and look round the camp

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to realise that it was a pretty serious set-up.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Respect.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You know, I know what you guys have been through.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Brutal.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Good effort, you know.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
On the women's island, they took a different approach.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Would you like a tour?

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't wait to see it.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Coconut.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's our passe.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Made by coconuts that we ate.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You've eaten a lot of coconuts.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Far too much coconuts.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The women had made a huge effort

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to make their camp feel homely and cheerful.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wow, guys, look at this.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is cool.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's very cool.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And it's so clean.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know, it is not easy to get an island like this clean.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is amazing.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is way better than I expected.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I look at how the men did stuff

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and it was functional, technical.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It didn't have this kind of warmth.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Little touches of decoration, you know.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
To me, it has much more of a heart...

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
..to it.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is home.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The first rule of survival

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is to find a safe place to build shelter.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just see the rocks in the distance just there?

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's home.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's where we're going.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The men chose an excellent spot.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Booyah!

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Beach!

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It was close to the sea,

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which is a great source of food,

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but set back enough from the beach

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to give the natural protection from the elements.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because it's elevated,

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
this is not really going to get that wet.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right, what do you want me to do, Paul?

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What we need now are cross members.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Having chosen their location,

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the men set about building shelter

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to protect themselves and their fire

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
from the frequent tropical storms.

139
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's got a fairly good canopy.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's got four corners that we can notch off,

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
put rope into, cover over the top.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
From my experience in the wild,

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
constructing a good shelter is crucial.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Not only to get yourself out of that water,

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but also just for morale.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, if you're just getting pissed off

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
all day, all night,

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to have somewhere to hide away,

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
get out of it, means so much.

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, um, these are the dormantries.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The men went on to build individual covered beds

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that were raised off the floor

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to protect them from the jungle critters.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A group of guys decided that they were going to start

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
throwing up a bed for everybody,

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and then you would personalise your own bed

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
by putting a roof on your pitch,

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
depth of bed, length of bed, that sort of thing.

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The beds were built using A-frames

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and lengths of washed-up rope for their mattresses.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OK, whose is the best, do you reckon?

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mine.

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And that's this one.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A man's bed is his castle.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I got stuck into my bed, making it as comfortable

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
as I possibly could, cos once I'd got in that bed,

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wanted that to be my personal place for me to go,

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
close my eyes and be at home.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I realised, once they decided to make individual beds,

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
pick a decent one, make it a palace.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you happy for me to have it, guys?

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
By all means, sir.

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are you going to be sad to leave this, Vic?

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, I am, yeah, yeah.

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That was my one luxury on this island,

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and a good night's sleep every night.

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, God, yes.

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If the beddies are rocking, don't come and rock in.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, Jesus.

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's really dense up here, so we need to get moving.

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
On the women's island,

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
establishing a base camp took longer.

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the direction where we should be heading in.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The group split, and after getting lost in the jungle...

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think it's that way.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
..it took them nine days to establish a permanent home

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
with a sustainable water source.

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
For the women, it wasn't until their final week on the island

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that they came up with the idea for a communal bed

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
where they could keep each other warm.

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
OK, and then just tie that there. Perfect.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We felt that it was a really important way

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of utilising our greatest resource, which are plastic bottles.

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And you can probably get six or seven of us on it.

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's fully lined.

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Can I have a go? Please go and lie on it.

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I mean, it's not quiet... No, it's not quiet.

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
..but it's comfy.

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I mean, this is...

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is 1,000 times comfier than the male one.

201
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes! Yes!

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The only thing is, you get up in the middle of the night, go for a pee,

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
everybody knows you're getting up.

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What have you been sleeping on before this?

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Beach. The beach.

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Which is brutal.

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But it's not bad if you're spooning, Bert.

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No. We love a spoon.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There were several really good reasons for sleeping as a group.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There was a sense of safety.

211
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If there were anything nasty was to come into camp,

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the group was there to deal with it.

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You've got to choose your spot now, Georgie.

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mmm, decisions, decisions.

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think we were really happy with spooning in a really sad way.

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It was quite a big comfort for a lot of us

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and definitely a way to keep warm.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nice and warm.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know, maybe this is a difference between men and women.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The men wanted their space.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They wanted these individual shelters where they can hide away

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and they go, I'm annoyed with him.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I close my curtains and I'm done.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But actually, community is strength.

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I very much anticipated that the women would be very much the homemakers.

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It would be right top of their list to build shelter.

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think it was interesting just how long it took.

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They look pretty good.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They just didn't have the skills.

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They had to learn these skills by getting things wrong

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and they got there in the end.

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But one thing the women were better at was making fire.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They did it much quicker than the men.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So this is Vesta.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
She was absolutely flaming, but she's decided to go a bit down.

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why Vesta?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because Vesta is the Roman goddess of the hearth.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
For us, she's been the heart of the camp

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and the main thing that we've kept going.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The women used a traditional friction-based method,

242
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
spinning a bow drill to create heat by friction...

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Bloody good ember.

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
..then blowing on the ember to breathe life into the flame.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Here we go! Oh, my God!

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wow!

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's got fire!

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's got fire!

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, we tried all sorts, the bow and the shaft thing,

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
holding it and rubbing it up and down like fools

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and sweating onto it and spoiling it.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We got no smoke or anything.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
To me. To me.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Awesome.

255
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That learning curve just went like a U-bend. Boom.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's gone out of need. Fuck all.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just basically using the sun to focus there in one point

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
has given us quite a lot of heat.

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It was Kyle that sat most of the second day having a go at it.

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean, that man's determination was unbelievable.

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sat for hours holding his glasses.

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on.

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Get the sticks ready, lads.

264
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Get up there, get up there.

265
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You've got it, you've got it, you've got it!

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Go, go, go!

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah!

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He was the unsung hero. He really was.

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And, my God, we thanked him for it.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fucking yes!

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You nailed it.

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're the hero.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But the fire didn't help them deal with the sandflies,

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
which attack at sunrise and sunset

275
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and they feed on the protein in human blood.

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, it's swollen.

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They were unmerciful.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They really were unmerciful.

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Scabbed.

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh!

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They got covered head to foot in sandfly bites

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and that can have a real demoralising effect.

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're scratching, then things get septic,

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you know, you've got salt wounds, a big no-no.

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They bit constantly.

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, constantly being bitten.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can just see them all flying around, it's horrible.

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It makes me itch thinking about the insects.

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They were everywhere, in people's knickers.

290
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There was no way you could sit down at all unless you're in the water.

291
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Unless you're in the water where some sort of insect

292
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
or some sort of bug is not going to absolutely tear your skin apart.

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I feel like I'm turning into the fucking Elephant Man.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If anybody films me, I'll kick off.

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You fucking bitch!

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And neither did the men escape unscathed.

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, God!

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sandfly, seriously.

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll burn or cut this island down

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
if that's what it means to get rid of them.

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But the islanders came up with some ingenious techniques

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to ward off the island critters.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You seal your hood round and put your boxer shorts

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that you've been wearing for four weeks over your face.

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You just sleep in that rigid position for, you know, six hours.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Just put that over like that.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There he is.

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Perfect.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever been through in my life.

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You mean you don't love the great outdoors, Jill?

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Not when I can't see it,

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
cos I've got to sleep with a fucking T-shirt over me face.

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I may as well be at fucking home with the lights out.

315
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And the women used some extra resources not available to the men.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The sanitary bag got misused

317
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and we found a few stuck sanitary towels all over your face.

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's not misused.

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They kept them away.

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's exactly the right use.

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I cleanse my face with sanitary towels now.

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now I've run out of cotton pads, you can't complain.

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're like, oh, sanitary towel, that'll work.

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
After six weeks utterly alone,

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've returned to see how the men and women adapted

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to surviving on their islands.

327
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When it comes to survival, I often talk about the rule of three,

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
which means you can survive three minutes without air,

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
three days without water,

330
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
three weeks without food.

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
During tropical storm season, rainwater is plentiful.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
As it rained, it used to come off the trees,

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
so we used to collect it that way.

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's running like a bloody tap.

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We nicknamed it the Jungle Tap.

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But once it hits the ground, water is contaminated.

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You've got to purify water properly.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you don't, you're going to get sick,

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and groundwater can contain

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
a whole host of nasties.

341
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, my God, that is horrible.

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you think about it, it's where the animals,

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
they come to drink, but also it's where they come to crap.

344
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So we'll fill the reservoir to the max

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and we'll let gravity do the rest.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
With each man needing to drink between two and four litres a day,

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
they invented a filtering system to purify the water before boiling.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It still doesn't look as clear as I was hoping it would.

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No.

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We've put it through several bottles with sand,

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with a bit of a ripped-up T-shirt in the bottom

352
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to try and filter out all the crap.

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It doesn't taste like piss, does it?

354
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It is like... It tastes like middleweight tea.

355
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Have you learned to hate drinking warm water?

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No, I don't mind it.

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And actually, it's good.

358
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's really good.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You don't have to kind of just knock it back.

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's decent water.

361
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The water was not an issue.

362
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And actually, dehydration was your own fault

363
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
rather than lack of water.

364
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
On the women's island,

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
their water source was far more polluted than the men's.

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That is fucking disgusting.

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It is. It really is.

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Definitely double filtering there.

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Fucking hell.

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Their system was simple but effective,

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
using one jerry can to filter

373
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
while the other was constantly on the boil.

374
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think it was Jamie's sock, a little bit of charcoal, my bra,

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and literally just dripped it through very, very slowly,

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and within a day, you've got 30 litres of the stuff.

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't want to drink the water.

378
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It tastes of poo.

379
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You drink it, then you gulp,

380
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and then you vomit.

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
With water sorted, they now needed to feed themselves.

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I ensured they had enough indigenous animals,

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
vegetation, and water to keep them alive.

384
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What they had to do was have the ingenuity

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to find it, catch it, and kill it.

386
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Welcome.

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Before entering this extreme environment,

388
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
they were given basic survival training

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in what they could hunt and trap.

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
These were just regular, ordinary, everyday people in regular jobs.

391
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Diverse jobs, but everyday jobs.

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is a boa constrictor.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This guy is edible.

394
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They do get huge.

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They've been known to take small children.

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can't afford to be squeamish.

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Killing your food is a survival reality.

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If it's food, it's fuel.

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're a testament to British engineering, this will be.

400
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In my experience, one of the most energy-efficient ways of hunting

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
is trapping.

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If it works.

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
From the intricate Cayman box trap,

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
which, when set off,

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
forms an inescapable prison...

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Meow!

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
..to the simple spring-loaded trap,

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
which uses a trigger system to ensnare the animal.

409
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It comes down to feed or water.

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Pour a little bit of beer down.

411
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Bingo.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I had this TV view of trapping.

413
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You make one trap, you catch one animal.

414
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, no, no, no.

415
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
OK, ready?

416
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You have to put out a lot of traps,

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you have to keep going back,

418
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you have to keep going back to them,

419
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and eventually, if you're lucky and you've done it right,

420
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you'll catch something.

421
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Right, I'll distract him.

422
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, Mr Croc!

423
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But once you've trapped an animal, you need to kill it.

424
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We need to get a loop over that mouth.

425
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Ooh! Look at that beauty!

426
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
With the crocodile, the men used a noose to control the jaws

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
so it could be manoeuvred into position.

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Watch him, watch him! Go now, go now!

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Then they used their body weight to pin it down.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on, all right!

431
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, mate, yes!

432
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's it.

433
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And dispatch as quickly and humanely as possible.

434
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The technique that they used to catch that crocodile

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
was actually textbook.

436
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It was pretty impressive, because there's no doubt,

437
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you know, you're faced with the number-one predator on the island.

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's intimidating.

439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I felt very, very strongly, like, if we're going to kill stuff,

440
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we should kill it humanely

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and we should not waste any scrap of it.

442
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Come on, look at that!

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Whoa!

444
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Mate, get in!

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Unbelievable!

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let the feast begin, boys!

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes!

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
These are some of the trophies we kept.

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We absolutely ate everything.

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Seven feet of beautiful crocodile.

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's all that remains, pretty much, apart from the sign.

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Thing is, if you hesitate, you lose.

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Set your traps, set multiples of them.

454
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You've got to be opportunistic.

455
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's great, you're right.

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Dosh.

457
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
While some men accepted that killing was necessary to eat...

458
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hi, sage and onion.

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ooh!

460
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
..one of the things I think the women struggled with

461
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
was putting aside their instinct to nurture

462
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and turning it to an instinct to hunt and to kill.

463
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hunting and killing has been the biggest eye-opener

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that I've taken from the island.

465
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Taking a life is never easy,

466
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and for the women, it was a real turning point.

467
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They overcame one of the hardest psychological obstacles,

468
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
showing they had what it takes to be survivors.

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can spend a week trying to trap an animal,

470
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and then the actual killing process is pretty gruesome.

471
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's actually a really emotional thing.

472
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Using a knife, the most humane way to dispatch an animal,

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
one way to dispatch a pig,

474
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is by severing its jugular veins,

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
which renders the animal unconscious.

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It was so hard. It was horrible.

477
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It took them a long time to embrace the hard reality

478
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
of this isn't going to be pretty.

479
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But from that point on, the women, just like the men,

480
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
were able to take their rightful place

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
at the top of the island's food chain.

482
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
While there's plenty to eat on land,

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and you can catch it,

484
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the most reliable source of food for the men and the women

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
wasn't on the island at all.

486
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
All of the seas around here are literally teeming with life.

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's something like 500 different edible species of fish,

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and it's why, when it comes to desert island survival,

489
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I always say to people, fish first.

490
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Once you figure out how to catch them,

491
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you've got a well-stocked larder right on your doorstep.

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, look, look, look, look!

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Rays. Fuck, they're shallow, aren't they?

494
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Come on, boys, let's get one of these.

495
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's easier said than done

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
when you don't have the right tools for the job.

497
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Stingrays won. Survivors now.

498
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah!

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, she just lost it!

500
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Get him behind it.

501
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh!

502
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Cut him off.

503
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?

504
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't think any fish you couldn't, couldn't eat around.

505
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's rubbish.

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I loved the fishing.

507
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I loved doing the fishing, but I was rubbish at it.

508
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Bastard him.

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That spear's not worth donkey poo.

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Fucking rubbish.

511
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then the reality kicks in that you have no idea what you're doing

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and hopefully that you're going to be able to clutch at things

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to make them work.

514
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's why it's called fishing and not catching.

515
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was a big learning curve.

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It really was a big learning curve.

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You fucking beauty!

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Look at the size of that bitch!

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
As part of their basic survival kit,

520
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I provided both islands with a handful of fishing hooks.

521
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, Barney, you're an inch or two longer.

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's directly proportional to the size of my penis.

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Which meant they could experiment with improvised rods.

524
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That idea is so romantic, isn't it?

525
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
To be able to carve your own fishing rod,

526
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
sit there with your stick like a gnome and soak up the sun.

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, I got a big one!

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Whoo!

529
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Fuck!

530
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it was far from romantic, really.

531
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It was a really hard graft.

532
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

533
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
She's caught a fish!

534
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
There it is!

535
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Daddy brought home the bacon!

536
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah!

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah!

538
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah!

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah!

540
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, I saved everybody.

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I was almost like Jesus.

542
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I fed the thousands with nothing more than a homemade fishing rod.

543
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
In a survival situation, the sea can be a lifesaver.

544
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But if you don't treat it with respect,

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
it can just as easily take you out.

546
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There he's gone!

547
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, shit!

548
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Whoo-hoo!

549
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've seen it happen.

550
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A misjudged tide or a freak wave and it's game over.

551
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Rock fishing can prove deadly.

552
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Best fishing was always in the most dangerous spot.

553
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And bad shit happens really quickly.

554
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It takes 12 months for Christmas to come.

555
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Bad stuff happens that quick.

556
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And that's why rock fishing is considered

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
one of the most dangerous sports in the world.

558
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, my God!

559
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, shit!

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Literally, within half a second, he was gone like that.

561
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And it was genuinely terrifying.

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I just remember screaming at the top of my voice,

563
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Ross!

564
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There's nothing like a successful hunt to lift the spirits.

565
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is this the first time we've actually had breakfast?

566
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah, I think it is.

567
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Amazing.

568
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But as I know from experience,

569
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the island diet can have a few unwelcoming effects.

570
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The island diet can have a few unwelcome repercussions.

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, pardon me.

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Sorry.

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
God, that was horrible.

574
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to have to go.

575
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, no, you're not going to be sick, are you?

576
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't know. I don't feel very well. Sorry!

577
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Pardon me.

578
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Why does that always happen when I'm talking about food?

579
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's not what's supposed to happen.

580
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Basically, I've been having explosive diarrhea.

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I would get completely naked, do a poo...

582
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
..and just run straight into the sea

583
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and have a shower and bath in the sea.

584
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
With no modern conveniences on the island,

585
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the call of nature presented something of a dilemma for the women.

586
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You were doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah.

587
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What?! Yes.

588
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Are you kidding me? No.

589
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Why are you shitting in the ocean?

590
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Because it's clean.

591
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Going for a poo.

592
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
A lot of people went in there.

593
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A lot of people went into the jungle and dug holes.

594
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I have to confess,

595
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I was really worried about something biting my bum,

596
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
so I used to go just on the water's edge,

597
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
which I know upset a lot of people.

598
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The men weren't so fussy about where they did their business.

599
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Here comes my esteemed colleague.

600
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I think he might have some good news for the camera.

601
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I've officially dropped anchor in Poo Bay three times.

602
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, such a relief. I feel like a new man.

603
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Going in the sea, for me,

604
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
it was absolutely perfect.

605
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So I've started shitting in the bath.

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Six weeks after abandoning the men and women

607
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
on two remote tropical islands,

608
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I went back to see for myself how they managed to stay alive.

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Shit!

610
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.

611
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Sometimes the hardest thing about surviving on a island

612
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
is living with your fellow castaways.

613
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's fucking immaturity.

614
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's sulking and it's attention-seeking.

615
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They don't know this is not an enjoyable experience for me.

616
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I fucking hate it.

617
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You pointing a finger at me and saying,

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.

619
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Kyle!

620
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,

621
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and it looks like... Yeah, yeah.

622
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Looks like you're doing fuck-all when it comes to wood.

623
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Before I went into the island, I was worried.

624
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It could go one of two ways.

625
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
When women are great, we're fantastic communicators,

626
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
good at multitasking.

627
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I know we're not finished.

628
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.

629
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So give me a break, please.

630
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not saying that, I'm just saying you haven't finished, that's all.

631
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Right.

632
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
When a group of women are bad,

633
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
it's bitchy and backstabbing and really nasty.

634
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Well, you're not here for the team any more,

635
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you're here for yourself.

636
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Are you trying to start an argument?

637
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm asking, that's what you're saying.

638
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You are trying to start an argument.

639
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I think I've done quite well to hold my tongue,

640
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
because I could have called her a fucking stupid cunt.

641
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Like I wanted to.

642
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Constantly moaning and grumbling and complaining.

643
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I think, oh, God, if you all do my head in.

644
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
If anything's going to make me leave this island,

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
it's the people.

646
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's the lack of team work.

647
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I think my major achievement was actually not hitting anybody.

648
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think one of my concerns for you guys right at the beginning

649
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
is that, you know, you're such diverse people.

650
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
When the gloves are off because you're tired, you're hungry,

651
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
from my experience, I can be quite explosive.

652
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And that is hard.

653
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know, you liked an argument, didn't you, Vic?

654
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Did I?

655
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't remember any of that.

656
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I was taking the bones out so we can use them for the next meal.

657
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
All that was left to do with that soup was stir it.

658
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
How difficult can stirring soup be?

659
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Because you are in such an extreme environment,

660
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
tiny, tiny little things are going to get you agitated.

661
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
To some it would look like you didn't want to do the harder job.

662
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I would say, fuck you to that person, that's what I'd say.

663
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And I was just like, guys, you're arguing about fucking soup.

664
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You know what I mean?

665
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Just let's fucking calm down, eh?

666
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
There's no need to be like this.

667
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I really do think that this experience

668
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is the ultimate pressure cooker environment.

669
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Living in close quarters like this, it's inevitable.

670
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're going to get conflict.

671
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
When there's a little bit too much pressure, you need to let it off.

672
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You need to have a good swear or a shout or fall out with somebody.

673
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Whether you're right or wrong, it's better.

674
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's better.

675
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But listen, Victor, I'm sure it won't be our last little lock on the horns,

676
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
but no hard feelings, mate.

677
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Not much weather, fella, not much weather.

678
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If left unchecked, tensions among the men could have torn the group apart,

679
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
but they came up with their own novel way of dealing with conflict.

680
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We've had our morning meetings and in that we've had a beef section.

681
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If anyone has a problem, it's aired to the group, in front of the group,

682
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and talked about like adults.

683
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
As a result, I think we can all say,

684
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
there's been the odd tiff here and there,

685
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
but nothing more than the lover's quarrel.

686
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Anyone got any beef?

687
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What's important is that grievances don't fester.

688
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If you can shine the light on what you're finding difficult,

689
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
it tends to go away.

690
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Good way to start the day.

691
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you think we're getting everything off our chest and everything like that?

692
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Do you think it's working?

693
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't want any beef stewing.

694
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Is that why you wanted to emcee, just for that jaw?

695
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That was it?

696
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I've been thinking about this all night.

697
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I thought so.

698
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The women devised an altogether different approach

699
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
to healing rifts in the group.

700
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Island therapy.

701
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll start.

702
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Bea, I feel like your positivity is something

703
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
that I've never come across before.

704
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I am so fond of you, Jules, and I think you're hilarious.

705
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's cringe.

706
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
One of the most important qualities is actually kindness.

707
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You know, and it's not something you necessarily immediately think

708
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
is critical to a survivor, but you live with someone for six weeks,

709
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and those sort of conditions,

710
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
boy, are you grateful for the person who's kind.

711
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Becky, I think you are absolutely wonderful.

712
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Maybe we didn't always perfectly get along.

713
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There were times where I'd quite like to have gouged their eyes out

714
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
or stabbed them in the face,

715
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
but I will always have experienced that with them,

716
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
so forever we'll have this amazing bond.

717
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Harvey, all that time we spent in the jungle together,

718
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I couldn't have got through it without you.

719
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You were so positive.

720
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm so sorry.

721
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm not used to it!

722
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Arriving on the island with little more than the clothes they stood up in,

723
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the island's beaches were a rich source of materials

724
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
for the castaways to put to good use.

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What's this? Yes!

726
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Look at that.

727
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Not the cleanest teacup in the world.

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm sure we can give it a wash for them.

729
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That is amazing!

730
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
A metal can that we can boil stuff in.

731
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Look what I've found.

732
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
An unopened can of ginger ale.

733
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No!

734
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And it's in date as well.

735
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, my God.

736
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
One thing that always staggers me with these desert islands,

737
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
however remote they are,

738
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
is just the amount of trash you often see washed up on the beaches.

739
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Discarded rubbish offered an opportunity

740
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to make life on the islands a little more comfortable.

741
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Hey, lads, look.

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Found a pink pear.

743
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Look at these bad boys.

744
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is the male version.

745
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
LAUGHTER

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What's this?

747
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, yes.

748
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Lovely toothbrush.

749
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That is brilliant.

750
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That is brilliant.

751
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh!

752
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I've got a pink, kind of 14-year-old girl's toothbrush.

753
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Where else would you do that?

754
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You take a little bit of burnt wood and stick it in your mouth

755
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and then a washed-up toothbrush you've found.

756
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
LAUGHTER

757
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But it was effective, actually.

758
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It was very effective.

759
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It was very effective.

760
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It was very effective.

761
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It was very effective.

762
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It was very effective.

763
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It was very effective.

764
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It was very effective.

765
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It was very effective.

766
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It was very effective.

767
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It was very effective.

768
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, my goodness.

769
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I found me a hair clip!

770
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I now have a collection of hair clips from the island.

771
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Another comb!

772
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Wide tooth!

773
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Very important.

774
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The women used scavenged items to turn their camp

775
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
into a home away from home

776
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and even created an island hair salon.

777
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And now...

778
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Bear, don't look too scared.

779
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
LAUGHTER

780
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This is where...

781
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
This is where I'm quite out of my comfort zone.

782
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Bear, when you threw me into that sea,

783
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I was out of my comfort zone!

784
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
LAUGHTER

785
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If it wasn't for all the treasures that the sea brought us,

786
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm not sure we would have been able to do as much as we did.

787
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
LAUGHTER

788
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Jungle headband.

789
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's good, that's a bit more Rambo.

790
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's quite...

791
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You survived my territory,

792
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and I've now survived yours.

793
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
LAUGHTER

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In this hostile environment,

795
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the castaways were putting their lives in danger on a daily basis.

796
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
There's no doubt with this experiment this island was not benign.

797
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, God!

798
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What the fuck was that?

799
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Something just fucked me.

800
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's a scorpion, guys!

801
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Everything on the island was dangerous.

802
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
There was nothing safe.

803
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They faced starvation, dehydration...

804
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You're so weak!

805
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
..and exhaustion.

806
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And it was inevitable, over six weeks, that there would be injuries.

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.

808
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

809
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Especially in the blistered area.

810
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The first thing that went through my head when the water can exploded was,

811
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
gosh, that is hot.

812
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And then the second thing was,

813
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
oh, my God, I don't want to leave the island.

814
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm still standing.

815
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

816
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So, if you can see there, you OK?

817
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah, yeah, I feel a little bit faint.

818
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You look ever so slightly peaky.

819
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
OK, so don't look, Bex.

820
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Just don't you dare look.

821
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
In case of a serious medical emergency,

822
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I had a rapid-response team on a 24-hour standby.

823
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But the islander still felt vulnerable.

824
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.

825
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, my God.

826
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh, my God.

827
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I definitely worried for my life on the island.

828
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Like, genuinely, after the collapse, then I realised,

829
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
yes, we have a support team,

830
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
but it does take them a while to get to us.

831
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So, yeah, we need to be careful.

832
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I just got off and I saw everything went black.

833
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What happens when you extend the amount of time

834
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
that they're trying to survive for,

835
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
you up the risk ratio exponentially.

836
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You know, cos now you're making decisions when you're tired,

837
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
you're dehydrated, you're starving,

838
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and so much can happen in those last few weeks.

839
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Be careful!

840
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Babe, babe, babe, babe!

841
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Any incident is a serious incident

842
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
when you're playing around with Mother Nature.

843
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The power of the water...

844
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Ah! Ah-ha! You OK? You OK?

845
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
OK.

846
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, shit!

847
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It was a hell of a fall.

848
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
See that? Yeah.

849
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That is almost... Oh, that's tendon.

850
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It was so close to the end, to making it,

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
but it wasn't to be, you know.

852
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Once evacuated from the island,

853
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
cameraman Will was flown to the nearest hospital.

854
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The plastic surgeon,

855
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
has done an awesome job.

856
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I had cut through a muscle

857
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that controlled the wrist,

858
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so I'm going to have a good scar.

859
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Erm...

860
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But...

861
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't know. Yeah.

862
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Everything's fine.

863
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Whoa! Look at that!

864
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Carbs and veg!

865
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The smell...

866
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Honestly, it's like nothing else.

867
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's absolutely heartbreaking.

868
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
To have not made it to the end.

869
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This kind of makes up a great little bit.

870
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
After six weeks on the island,

871
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
ten men and ten women made it through to the end.

872
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And now having survived...

873
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Looks like a tornado!

874
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That is terrifying!

875
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
..they were about to return to civilisation.

876
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK, come on, then, give us your highs and lows.

877
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Literally, just to get to the end

878
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and finally be watching the sunrise

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
of what will be my last day on the island,

880
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that was just overwhelming.

881
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We got past strangers, we got past friends,

882
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and we became family.

883
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Really do feel like you can conquer anything

884
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
when you're all together.

885
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
When we're going back home, what is there to stop us?

886
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Nothing else can really stand in our way.

887
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, you've got light in your eyes

888
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and it's in all of you.

889
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And you only get that glint

890
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
when you go through the mill,

891
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
come out the other side of it.

892
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Guys, I think you're amazing.

893
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's time to get you off this island.

894
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah!

895
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Let's go, boys.

896
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah!

897
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So Bear dropped us off on this island

898
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and it's just a random island.

899
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Bear then come back

900
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and he was picking me up off our island.

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And it was such a strange sensation

902
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and I think quite a lot of the other lads felt like that as well,

903
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
like that was our ground now.

904
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Whoo, boys!

905
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Return to civilisation was weird.

906
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You spent a lot of the time wishing for that day to come

907
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and dreaming about it and being like,

908
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
when that boat turns up, it's going to be amazing.

909
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Oh, we did it, guys!

910
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But then the reality was I wasn't ready.

911
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I wanted to stay.

912
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I wanted to stay with these amazing women

913
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and living in this amazing experience.

914
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well done, boys.

915
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well done.

916
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's grab a tackle and get out of here, yeah?

917
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Knowing that the time was up

918
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and that this great, great, great adventure we were on

919
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
was coming to an end,

920
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that was really sad, that, yeah.

921
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm so heartened to arrive here

922
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and actually see real, genuine love, care and community.

923
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And they don't look emaciated and broken.

924
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
They look actually healthy and smiling and proud.

925
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And pride is something that is hard won

926
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and they've done it the hard way.

927
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh, the relief. Absolute relief.

928
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Just to know that we were finally going to get back to reality

929
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
where we can fill our bellies,

930
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it was just, yeah, amazing.

931
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.

932
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah!

933
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You've done it. You've done it.

934
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's, like, so happy.

935
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
For the men's arrival, a special welcoming party awaited.

936
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
In they come.

937
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
In the form of injured cameraman Will.

938
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Will you?

939
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I could see all their faces on the side of the boat

940
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and I kind of gave them a little wave

941
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and they all kind of, like, cheered and jumped out,

942
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
came running over.

943
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's giving me goosebumps now to think of it.

944
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Wow, you all stink!

945
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It was, you know, it was really good

946
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to kind of get the team back together.

947
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
After spending six weeks cut off from the world...

948
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, it's so weird to touch.

949
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
..re-acclimatising was going to take time.

950
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It feels...

951
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm going to need to train myself.

952
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I can't remember how to work it.

953
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I knew this was going to happen, I'd forgotten how to work it.

954
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It feels so weird!

955
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Fucking hell, it looks weird!

956
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That first phone call.

957
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I was really looking forward to it,

958
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
but not the emotional rollercoaster that I knew was going to come.

959
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, purely speaking to my missus just pushed me over the edge.

960
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Never, never been like that in my life that I can remember

961
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
other than being a kid sobbing over bugger all.

962
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.

963
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
My bit of squeeze on the phone, it was lovely.

964
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It was really nice.

965
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Hello, baby!

966
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm so happy to talk to you, I cannot tell you.

967
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Do I say good to hear your voice?

968
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It was so strange and weird and intense

969
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and I really loved it.

970
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I really loved it.

971
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I didn't realise that when I spoke to my mum and heard her voice,

972
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
just how powerful that was.

973
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Hello?

974
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Mum!

975
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Is that Mummy?

976
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

977
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Oh, Mummy!

978
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I wasn't upset, I was just so happy.

979
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I've never been so happy.

980
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
My mum's pissed me off since being back.

981
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
She's annoying, but, you know, I'm not going to try and forget that.

982
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm going to take that moment with a phone call

983
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
because, actually, you realise that she's not annoying,

984
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
she's the best.

985
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Hello?

986
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Hello!

987
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Hearing my daughter's voice after six weeks was just beautiful.

988
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, baby, I've missed you so much!

989
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And kind of made me realise what I have,

990
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
how rich my, kind of, life at home is.

991
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The truth is, you cannot go on this island, endure,

992
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and leave the island the same person.

993
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It is a life-transforming experience.

994
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh, my God!

995
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
After being stripped of all modern comforts,

996
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
the men and the women had an appreciation for the simplest things.

997
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh!

998
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Returning to the civilisation was really weird.

999
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Whoo!

1000
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I got sort of visual indigestion.

1001
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh!

1002
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Oh!

1003
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh, my God!

1004
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Look at this!

1005
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Get in front of the shower and everything!

1006
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Get in the toilet!

1007
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

1008
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I can't get over how beautiful it is!

1009
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Argh!

1010
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh!

1011
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Fucking hell!

1012
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, God!

1013
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
No way!

1014
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Everything that you totally took for granted

1015
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is suddenly the most amazing thing.

1016
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, my God!

1017
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Argh!

1018
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You know, we're a few months on now,

1019
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and I'm still just so grateful of everything.

1020
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Every silly thing.

1021
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Sitting on a chair, you know.

1022
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Where does that chair come from?

1023
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's amazing.

1024
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I can't believe I'm talking about a chair.

1025
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Wow!

1026
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yay!

1027
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That looks great.

1028
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
After weeks of surviving on very little food,

1029
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the men and the women were given a strict diet to follow

1030
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
to allow their bodies time to recover.

1031
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Wow!

1032
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The starter.

1033
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That better be the starter. Yeah.

1034
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We were instructed that we would be given a meal plan,

1035
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and I thought the meal plan would have been a lot bigger.

1036
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's so good.

1037
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's so good.

1038
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I just wish it was four times as big.

1039
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Just can't get it in quick enough.

1040
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, my God.

1041
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh!

1042
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Want more food?

1043
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Six.

1044
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I have secret videos of me and Belinda

1045
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
when we got off the island scoffing Mars bars and drinking beer.

1046
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh!

1047
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Have a crisp.

1048
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
How are they?

1049
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
That night when I come off the island,

1050
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I went against the rules

1051
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and I ate, I think, two or three steaks,

1052
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
pina coladas, beers.

1053
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I went to town.

1054
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That night, I went to bed,

1055
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
three o'clock in the morning,

1056
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it was like someone had opened up a tap in my arse,

1057
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and I never got off the toilet until about ten o'clock the next day.

1058
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think I lost about six stone in one sitting.

1059
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I think what I gained from the island

1060
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
was a sense that the human spirit is unbreakable.

1061
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes!

1062
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It made me feel fantastic.

1063
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I was 25 again.

1064
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
For six weeks, it was great.

1065
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Fantastic.

1066
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Thank you.

1067
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I am not alone.

1068
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I am not the same person who went to the island.

1069
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I was really shy.

1070
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I was just scared of what people would make of me.

1071
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But the island, it helped me find friends,

1072
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
like, lifelong friends.

1073
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I think we had an amazing bond.

1074
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We've shared experience of that,

1075
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
which we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

1076
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
She floats!

1077
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What? They've made her out?

1078
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's that feeling of living on the edge

1079
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and living in the extremes.

1080
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But still being really happy.

1081
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's what amazed me the most.

1082
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
100% I would do it again.

1083
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I loved it.

1084
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I think, probably, the experience of the island,

1085
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
for me, was life-changing

1086
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and incredibly humbling.

1087
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I just think it's the best thing I've ever done.

1088
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Full stop.

1089
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Seeing them at the end, proud of what they've done,

1090
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
tight as a group, actually is inspiring.

1091
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And, ultimately, they learned, never give up.

1092
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Every single one of them said that.

1093
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
They said, this is about just being bloody-minded

1094
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and not giving up and sticking with it.

1095
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And, really, that's the heart of a great survivor.

1096
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
CHEERING

1097
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
