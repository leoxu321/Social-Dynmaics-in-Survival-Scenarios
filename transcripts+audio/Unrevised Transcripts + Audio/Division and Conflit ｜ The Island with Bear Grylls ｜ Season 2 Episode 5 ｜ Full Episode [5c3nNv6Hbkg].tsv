0	14700	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14700	23240	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be
23240	30860	utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything
30860	40940	themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental
40940	51740	strength the Windsor day it's too cute I can't who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we
51740	52980	follow the men's island
53240	65300	it's a scorpion guys it'll be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height of the harsh
65300	70700	tropical storm season a bit like being in a disaster film they'll have to find their own water
72620	81380	and hunt for their own food watch him watch him go now go now that is amazing have these modern
81380	82940	day men got what it takes
83240	89240	to survive we're all sweating our bollocks off up there fella and it looks like yeah yeah looks
89240	90980	like you're doing call when it comes to wood
94700	104780	two weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island
106580	112460	that was the dumbest thing I ever did but now three of the men have quit now the dead weight's off let's get on with it
113240	117200	there and the island has taken its toll on the 11 that remain
119060	121460	I'm genuine I've never been so terrified in my life
123680	129260	having barely found anything substantial to eat they're now on the brink of starvation
130460	133580	we ain't conquered Jack nothing
143240	149240	and they say nothing
149240	152020	speaking of who you are
152260	154920	scriptwriting
154920	160340	it's a bit like being in a disaster film or you know or when um you hear on the
160340	168920	news that people have had a typhoon come through or a flood there's no water there's no electricity
168920	170600	you know stomachache
170600	171600	car is definitely needs some organます
171600	172820	could you get on with the show
172820	175840	like you've been hit by a major disaster.
185360	187260	Oh, look, another day in paradise.
190840	194040	It's been 15 days since the men arrived on the island.
197320	200600	And so far, they have survived on a meager diet
200600	204840	of a few hundred calories a day.
204840	210260	So thin now, like ribs, all sorts of bones
210260	215380	appearing that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.
215380	218760	Oh, hang on.
218760	222000	Oh, hang on.
222000	224620	Lie down, mate, if you've.
224620	226220	Oh.
226220	227900	It's the nearest I've got to fainting,
227900	230000	or I assume it's fainting, having never
230000	230600	fainted before.
230600	234140	But my vision just went, like, pulsating in and out,
234140	236420	in and out, in and out, in and out.
236420	239300	And then before I knew it, I was on my ass.
239300	240220	Sort of semi-collapsed.
246420	250820	We're surviving off limpets and, like, the odd one fish.
250820	253720	It's not going to sustain us for the next god-how-ever weeks.
253720	257220	I think another week of this, we'll be struggling massively
257220	259080	just to even get up in the morning.
259080	260000	We need to find a way.
260000	264740	We need to find a solid source of food or, you know,
264740	266000	we're going to be facing meltdown.
269000	270240	We're out of food.
270240	272700	The bottom line is we don't have any food other than limpets.
272700	273780	We're getting weaker and weaker.
273780	275940	I certainly feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker.
275940	280480	So my priority is how I feel about, personally, is food.
280480	282160	I think the majority of our resources
282160	285940	should be to getting us good fish today.
285940	287240	Let's go.
287240	288660	We are going to find lunch.
290000	297000	Come on, fishy, fishy, fishy.
297000	301000	In a survival situation, you always face one huge dilemma.
301000	303700	And that is, if you want to eat, you've got to hunt.
303700	305440	Hunting burns your energy.
305440	308500	And there's no guarantee you're actually going to catch
308500	310360	anything at the end of it.
310360	311940	Any glimmers yet, Vic?
311940	313180	Oh, I can see fish.
313180	314920	Can you?
314920	318000	Bastard, you.
318000	320000	Every time you go looking for food, you're gambled.
320000	321000	You're gambling.
321000	323000	You're gambling with your energy reserves.
323000	324000	You know what, Pidge?
324000	326000	You seem to be a bit lacking in enthusiasm.
326000	331000	Oh, I'm so dead on my feet.
331000	333000	I'm actually dead on my feet.
333000	336000	I feel just completely gone.
341000	345000	You just keep nibbling it straight off the end.
345000	347000	The luck of the gods is not with us today.
350000	352000	Everyone's getting tired.
352000	353000	Everyone's hungry.
353000	354000	Everyone's sick of bacon limpets.
354000	355000	We need some decent food.
355000	356000	We need it quick.
356000	370500	If we don't get it soon, we're just going to start dropping like fires.
370500	375000	Despite the group's desperation, one man refuses to be beaten.
375000	379000	Let's all push it to the edge.
379000	380000	I feel fine.
380000	381000	Another day at the office.
381000	386000	I feel really good, yeah.
386000	395000	Vic wants to change tactics and take the hunt to an unexplored part of the island.
395000	401000	One kilometer from camp is a vast freshwater lagoon where he believes a much bigger prize
401000	403000	could be lurking.
403000	407000	One that could provide the group with the calories they so desperately need.
407000	408000	We are going hunting for fish.
408000	410000	We are going hunting for Mr. Cayman.
410000	413000	Let's go lay some traps, fellas.
413000	416000	Let's go hunt some beast.
416000	424000	As well as the search for food, the men's survival depends on them having a constant supply of drinking water.
424000	432000	They need at least 30 liters a day, which they must collect on a back-breaking two-kilometer round trip.
432000	436000	Sam, when you go past Carl, can you ask him to come and help do the water run, please?
438000	441000	He's not shirking, is he?
441000	445000	Hey, I'm just saying the water run he's doing, and he's chewing his gums.
445000	447000	You do the maths.
447000	449000	All right.
449000	450000	Let's go.
450000	452000	Grab Carl.
452000	456000	Kyle, are those crocs going to be okay for going across to get some water?
456000	460000	Uh, there's nothing else knocking about to do water.
460000	462000	I've done a lot of mileage the last few days.
462000	465000	I think I'd rather do something a bit more camp-based today.
465000	466000	I've done water two days in a row, mate.
466000	467000	Yeah.
467000	469000	So this is my third day, so, you know.
469000	470000	Yeah, yeah, I appreciate it.
470000	473000	Well, we've got 11 people here.
473000	475000	But they're not here now, mate.
475000	476000	Yeah.
476000	478000	Uh, Carl, why don't we just sit here and tidy the camp, then?
478000	479000	I'll do it.
479000	480000	That's no problem, mate.
480000	482000	Cheers.
482000	483000	Cheers.
483000	484000	Thanks, Piers.
484000	485000	All right.
485000	486000	Off we go.
490000	493000	I just sat in the office in front of the screens.
493000	495000	I know there's more to life than that.
495000	499000	So I just got to a stage where I wanted to break away from it, step away from the screens,
499000	502000	and just do something different.
502000	505000	I like to think I can step up to most challenges.
505000	509000	I like to see myself as someone who will see things through to the end.
509000	515000	So if I was a person who was struggling in the group and was a useless one,
515000	517000	that would be a big knock to my confidence.
517000	518000	Big knock.
522000	524000	I was a little disappointed in Kyle.
524000	526000	It would have been nice if he just stepped up to the plate and said,
526000	528000	you know what, I'll step in.
528000	531000	But he wasn't in the mood to do that today.
531000	533000	It's not so much that I'm hungry.
533000	535000	The worst thing is just the energy.
535000	541000	I never for a second thought my energy would be as low as it has been.
541000	542000	Fuck.
542000	544000	I can't even lift up my legs.
551000	553000	Now keep an eye out for Mr. Fucking Yurt.
554000	556000	See a caiman, I'll scream.
556000	557000	Yes.
557000	559000	How big did they say they get?
559000	561000	Fuck, there's not many of these.
561000	564000	Six foot, the caiman, and six meters, the alligator.
564000	565000	Oh, these are alligators?
565000	566000	Yeah.
566000	567000	Fuck it.
570000	573000	I don't know where Vic gets his energy, but I need half of that energy.
573000	578000	Because Vic has got energy all the way through the day.
578000	580000	If I could take anything away from this island,
580000	582000	I would like to be a little bit more like Vic Fellows.
584000	586000	See, like that.
586000	588000	That is actual shit.
588000	590000	What the fuck is this, Jurassic Park?
590000	591000	That's not shit.
591000	592000	That's shit.
592000	593000	That's not shit, fella.
593000	594000	What is it?
594000	595000	That's mud out of here.
595000	596000	Do you know what it is?
596000	598000	I'm sure there's a T-Rex here.
598000	599000	Oh, fuck, that's great.
602000	605000	What do you do if you see something snapping at your feet?
605000	606000	What are you going to do?
606000	608000	Are you going to just machete it?
608000	611000	Worst case scenario, we can't pin him or what have you.
611000	612000	I'm fighting for my life.
612000	613000	It's happening, isn't it?
613000	616000	As best as a facilities manager can do.
621000	622000	I'm 47.
622000	625000	This could be my last crazy hurrah.
625000	628000	And what better way to do it than the ultimate challenge
628000	629000	of surviving?
629000	630000	I mean, it's the ultimate challenge.
630000	632000	Can I provide for me?
635000	636000	Yes, I am very excited.
636000	638000	It's Boy Scouts shit, isn't it?
638000	639000	We're all over it.
639000	641000	We get knives and spears and stuff,
641000	642000	maybe even a bow and arrow to make.
642000	643000	I mean...
643000	644000	How good does it get?
644000	646000	Excited is an understatement.
646000	648000	Yes, sometimes I have to keep...
649000	651000	..put a lid on it to not let it get like,
651000	652000	boom, shiz!
652000	654000	That kind of excitement, yeah.
656000	658000	Just keep quiet, keep quiet, guy,
658000	661000	cos if there is a croc, we'll see it.
661000	662000	Where do caimans live?
662000	663000	I don't know.
665000	667000	I presume they lived in the water.
668000	670000	I thought they lived up trees.
671000	672000	Do caimans live in holes?
673000	675000	I reckon caimans live in holes.
675000	676000	Oh, dear.
676000	677000	Well, I'm making that up, but...
677000	679000	It sounds good, though.
682000	683000	I think I've got something in my bollocks
683000	684000	that's coming out.
686000	688000	Crocodiles are ambush predators.
688000	690000	They hunt their prey in shallow waters
690000	692000	and are masters of the stealth attack.
694000	695000	We'll raise a sharp tee,
695000	699000	and a bite that's three times more powerful than a lion.
699000	700000	Shhh.
700000	703000	Sam, shhh.
703000	705000	That is a caiman.
705000	706000	Look, he's up, he's up.
706000	707000	Fuck, he's a biggie.
707000	709000	Now, there is our baby.
709000	710000	That is dinner, yeah.
710000	711000	That is our dinner.
711000	713000	We can get in there.
713000	715000	Would it be worth swimming in?
716000	717000	Not for me.
717000	718000	I'm not swimming in that.
718000	719000	Not a chance.
722000	724000	That is insanity, yeah.
725000	726000	Fucking bastard, him.
728000	729000	Look, look, look, he's moving.
729000	730000	He's moving.
730000	732000	Got a bit of a ripple behind him.
732000	736000	Look at that sign in that fucking head.
736000	739000	He's an inquisitive, he's a little boy, isn't he?
739000	742000	Come to daddy.
742000	744000	We now need to find where he comes in and goes out.
748000	751000	OK.
751000	753000	Wherever we are now is where they come out.
753000	754000	Yeah.
754000	755000	Dead right.
755000	759000	That is where crocs come out of the water.
759000	761000	Yeah, that is perfect, isn't it?
761000	765000	I'm going to make a snare there, right towards the water.
765000	768000	Have you ever caught anything that snared before?
768000	770000	Have I ever made a snare before?
770000	772000	No.
772000	773000	Oh, he's there, he's about.
773000	774000	He's back, he's back.
774000	775000	Where, where, where?
775000	776000	Straight through here.
776000	777000	Straight through here.
777000	778000	See him?
778000	780000	He fucking has got closer as well, hasn't he?
780000	783000	That shifty little bastard has got closer, hasn't he?
783000	784000	He's not scared of us.
788000	789000	He'll have to keep an eye on him.
789000	791000	Well, I'm setting the trap.
791000	793000	That's why I keep looking past you.
793000	795000	He keeps dropping and dunnies that bugger him.
795000	798000	The men have had just two days' survival training
798000	801000	where they learnt how to set basic traps.
801000	804000	But the reality of catching a crocodile
804000	808000	that can measure up to 13 feet is a different matter entirely.
808000	811000	This is proper Boy Scout shit, this, isn't it?
811000	812000	He's going to test it.
812000	813000	I'll test it.
813000	815000	Yeah?
815000	817000	Oh!
817000	818000	Dinner is served.
818000	819000	Oh!
819000	820000	Eh?
820000	821000	That's not bad, is it?
821000	822000	That's all right, fellas.
822000	823000	Oh!
823000	824000	That's the one.
824000	825000	Let's go.
825000	826000	Let's bust a move.
826000	827000	Back to base, yeah?
827000	830000	Back to base.
830000	833000	Late afternoon.
833000	836000	58-year-old Phil is returning from the water run
836000	838000	with the help from Dr Pearce.
838000	839000	Watch your step.
839000	840000	Yeah.
840000	842000	It's a good thing we didn't carry over the jerry can
842000	844000	up and down these rocks.
844000	845000	Whoo!
845000	847000	And home.
847000	851000	While Kyle continues to rest on the beach.
851000	853000	There's a feeling amongst Camden
853000	857000	he's not contributing as much as he should be.
857000	860000	It's just I feel like I've just been trying to deal with the fire
860000	862000	and do the water,
862000	867000	and Kyle's been kind of doing the feet manicuring bit.
867000	869000	It's a little bit like anything in life, you know.
869000	871000	You can have a rest, but do the work first.
871000	875000	It's been almost two weeks since Kyle ensured the group's survival
875000	877000	by starting a fire with his guys.
877000	879000	And now he's got his glasses.
879000	881000	Now, when Kyle first got in here, he cracked the fire.
881000	883000	It was absolutely brilliant.
883000	885000	Since then, man's not got a day's graft in him.
885000	887000	Not a freaking day's graft in him.
889000	892000	I get the distinct impression, Vic, that you're getting a bit miffed.
892000	895000	I'm just getting miffed by anybody that springs into my mind
895000	897000	that's not sweating as hard as me.
897000	899000	Pull your thumb out of your arse, you lazy bastard.
905000	906000	Todd?
906000	907000	Yeah?
907000	909000	I feel like I'm kind of nearing my physical limit,
909000	911000	and I think it's quite a common event I'll come down
911000	914000	and you're doing your feet or you're sitting by the fire.
914000	916000	I'm going to be completely honest with you.
916000	918000	I feel that perhaps you haven't been pulling your weight
918000	919000	in the last week or so, OK?
922000	926000	Today, for me, has been a bit of a challenging one, actually.
926000	927000	Can't lie.
927000	931000	I haven't been able to do as much as I thought I would be able to,
931000	934000	and, like, when you're in this situation,
934000	936000	if you can't contribute,
936000	938000	you feel like you're really letting the team down.
945000	947000	Despite the men's best efforts,
947000	950000	it's yet another day with empty stomachs.
951000	953000	Bloody hell.
953000	955000	Boys, there's no meat on you.
955000	957000	You need a bit of cake.
958000	961000	Hey, look, you can see Piers' heart beating through his rib, look.
961000	963000	Fucking hell.
966000	968000	Being hungry...
968000	970000	..really...
970000	974000	..does affect your mental and your physical state.
974000	977000	Every step is hard when you're hungry.
977000	980000	There would be a stage where, soon,
980000	983000	our bodies give up on us.
984000	986000	And we're not far from that.
986000	993000	How are you feeling now?
993000	995000	Exhausted.
997000	1000000	After over two weeks of near starvation,
1000000	1003000	the men's situation is becoming critical.
1007000	1010000	Desperate to catch a high-calorie prize,
1010000	1013000	Vic and Dan have decided to go on a diet.
1013000	1015000	It's been a long, long journey.
1015000	1018000	Vic and Dan have set multiple crocodile traps
1018000	1020000	around the island's freshwater lagoon.
1020000	1022000	Bingo.
1022000	1025000	But so far, they haven't caught a thing.
1025000	1027000	By the look of it, it's done sod all.
1027000	1029000	Fuck.
1029000	1030000	Shit.
1030000	1032000	Nothing, I'm afraid.
1034000	1037000	On such an extreme low-calorie diet,
1037000	1039000	you're susceptible to infection
1039000	1041000	and your mental capacity is low.
1041000	1043000	And if nothing changes,
1043000	1045000	really, you're on borrowed time.
1045000	1048000	Over two weeks with barely any food going in,
1048000	1051000	the men's morning routines are anything but regular.
1053000	1055000	I feel like it's got to that moment where
1055000	1058000	I'm probably going to need to go for a shit-sink.
1058000	1060000	When it comes to options,
1060000	1062000	if they've got land or sea,
1062000	1064000	I think I'm going to opt for the sea.
1067000	1068000	Where are you going to go?
1068000	1071000	I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction?
1071000	1073000	I don't know.
1073000	1076000	I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction or...?
1083000	1084000	He's going for it.
1084000	1086000	Carl's taking a dump in the sea.
1086000	1088000	Good man.
1088000	1091000	Yeah, the most beautiful spot in the world to take a dump in.
1093000	1095000	Have you joined the poo crew?
1095000	1097000	So, I'm one for, back at home,
1097000	1100000	maybe a four to five shit a day, man.
1100000	1102000	A day? A day?
1102000	1105000	I'm pretty good, I'm very regular.
1105000	1109000	And I haven't shat until half six this morning
1109000	1111000	and now I feel enlightened.
1113000	1115000	I'm now part of the poo crew.
1115000	1119000	But 28-year-old Piers, the group's doctor,
1119000	1121000	isn't having as much success.
1121000	1123000	How's your, um...
1123000	1125000	How are the bowels? Bowels?
1125000	1126000	Any movement yet?
1126000	1128000	Being stubborn.
1128000	1130000	Wow. No poo for 15 days.
1133000	1134000	It'll come.
1139000	1142000	Are you ready? One, two, three.
1142000	1143000	With no food to eat,
1143000	1147000	the men still have to expend their energy on vital tasks,
1147000	1149000	like keeping their fire going
1149000	1152000	to boil and purify the water that they collect.
1152000	1153000	Hello, hello.
1153000	1156000	If you want to get a nice picture of Carl grooming himself,
1156000	1159000	you're quite welcome to do that while we're all getting wood.
1159000	1161000	Where's that? Just round the corner, doing his toes after.
1161000	1162000	He's just had a swim.
1165000	1167000	Today, we were supposed to all contribute getting wood
1167000	1169000	and then do individual tasks,
1169000	1171000	and he has done nothing.
1171000	1175000	I think my tolerance has kind of reached a bit of a limit.
1175000	1177000	You know, if you do let it boil inside,
1177000	1179000	it does become a bit of a problem when it comes to a head,
1179000	1180000	like it is now.
1183000	1185000	I can't hold something. I can't.
1185000	1187000	But, listen, when everybody...
1187000	1188000	And it ain't just me.
1188000	1190000	When lots of people bitch and chaff
1190000	1192000	and nobody seems to want us to confront it,
1192000	1194000	I think, come on, boys, we're team-mates.
1199000	1200000	Fuck it.
1203000	1205000	Where is he?
1205000	1207000	Up there, sound his arse.
1209000	1212000	He's taking piss. Come on, man, fucking hell.
1212000	1213000	Kyle!
1217000	1218000	Kyle.
1218000	1219000	How you doing?
1220000	1222000	I'm busting my knackers, fella, doing wood,
1222000	1223000	and you're doing your feet.
1223000	1225000	I'm not doing my feet. I've come out of the water.
1225000	1226000	Whatever.
1226000	1227000	Yeah.
1227000	1228000	It's not just me.
1228000	1229000	It just seems that I'm the only one with balls
1229000	1230000	to come up and speak to you.
1230000	1231000	No, that's fine.
1231000	1232000	Every fucker's bitching and moaning
1232000	1233000	that you're never doing wood with us.
1233000	1235000	We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,
1235000	1236000	and it looks like...
1236000	1237000	Yeah, yeah, sorry.
1237000	1239000	Looks like you're doing fuck all when it comes to wood.
1239000	1241000	Admittedly, I'm not getting wood now,
1241000	1242000	cos I've just come out of the water,
1242000	1243000	cos I went through shit.
1243000	1247000	We're fucking pulling tree upon tree upon tree,
1247000	1249000	and it does look like you're always doing your feet.
1249000	1251000	I won't lie to you, it does.
1251000	1252000	Let's go.
1257000	1260000	It was almost like a bit of a cheap shot from Vic.
1260000	1264000	He's clearly got stuff which has been bubbling under the surface.
1264000	1266000	I felt like...
1267000	1269000	..I haven't fitted in with the group,
1269000	1274000	and, you know, I've done stuff to try and change that.
1276000	1279000	But sometimes it's just the group dynamics
1279000	1280000	that's on for everyone.
1282000	1285000	People are starting to fray around the edges.
1287000	1288000	Some of them are fraying,
1288000	1291000	some of them are coming away at the seams.
1291000	1294000	We seriously, seriously need to find
1294000	1296000	a sustainable source of food.
1298000	1300000	As the men continue to physically decline,
1300000	1302000	the group is becoming fractured,
1302000	1304000	and if members of the group are perceived
1304000	1306000	not to be pulling their weight,
1306000	1308000	they can easily become alienated.
1308000	1310000	And then if those rifts aren't healed,
1310000	1313000	it becomes a downward spiral of conflict
1313000	1316000	that ultimately could destroy the men's community.
1321000	1322000	Hello.
1327000	1329000	There's a net here. A net?
1329000	1330000	Yeah.
1331000	1333000	Oh, yeah.
1333000	1334000	Mate, this could be big.
1334000	1336000	This could make a big difference to us.
1336000	1337000	Game-changer.
1337000	1338000	Game-changer.
1338000	1340000	Could be.
1340000	1341000	Fellas!
1341000	1343000	Look what I found!
1343000	1345000	We've got ourselves a gill net!
1345000	1346000	Whoo-hoo!
1346000	1348000	Fucking brilliant.
1348000	1349000	It's pretty fucking big!
1349000	1350000	Yeah!
1350000	1351000	Get in there, baby!
1351000	1352000	What a whale!
1352000	1353000	Nice one, Will!
1353000	1354000	Sting of the dog!
1354000	1355000	Yes!
1355000	1356000	Roar, roar!
1356000	1357000	Brilliant.
1357000	1358000	Let's get ourselves some tea.
1359000	1361000	If we get this net in the water,
1361000	1365000	then we have our best hope yet of catching fish.
1365000	1367000	For thousands of years,
1367000	1369000	fishermen have been perfecting the art
1369000	1371000	of setting their fishing nets.
1371000	1375000	If you get it right, you unlock the ocean's larder.
1375000	1376000	If you get it wrong,
1376000	1379000	then all they'll be doing is wasting their precious time
1379000	1380000	and precious energy,
1380000	1383000	two resources that they can't afford to waste.
1385000	1387000	Net's out. Exciting times.
1387000	1388000	What are we looking at?
1388000	1389000	Yeah.
1390000	1391000	Feel quite positive.
1391000	1393000	I think it will catch fish.
1393000	1395000	I think it might even catch fish for us tonight.
1395000	1396000	Yeah.
1402000	1405000	Exhausted after a morning's hard work,
1405000	1407000	the men allow themselves some downtime.
1407000	1409000	So, boys, here's one.
1409000	1412000	You can request Bear to bring you one item
1412000	1413000	for the journey back.
1413000	1415000	Thermos full of English breakfast tea.
1415000	1417000	I am going to get a bottle of octomar whisky.
1417000	1418000	A whole bottle of whisky?
1418000	1421000	A whole bottle of octomar whisky for my journey back.
1421000	1422000	Bam!
1422000	1424000	If I could...
1424000	1426000	..chicken pie my wife makes,
1426000	1428000	and she always puts your name in it as well.
1428000	1429000	Nice.
1429000	1431000	All the big love art and all that sort of thing.
1431000	1432000	Pock pastry lid?
1432000	1433000	Yes, dead right.
1433000	1434000	It's quite easy.
1434000	1436000	You see if it doesn't work out with you and your missus,
1436000	1437000	can you give her our number?
1437000	1440000	I honestly think there's something wrong with her upstairs
1440000	1442000	because she really is a nice woman.
1442000	1443000	How did you find such a nice woman?
1443000	1444000	I have no idea.
1444000	1445000	What have you done?
1445000	1447000	You must have a size of a dick and a donkey.
1447000	1448000	Not a clue.
1448000	1450000	Not a clue, but God bless her.
1450000	1452000	How did you meet your wife, if you don't mind me asking?
1452000	1453000	I went round and knocked on her door.
1453000	1454000	Did you?
1454000	1455000	I fucking did, yeah.
1455000	1456000	Dead right I did, yeah.
1456000	1457000	What did you say?
1457000	1458000	Hello, I saw you at work today.
1458000	1459000	You turned up to meet your mate.
1459000	1460000	Yeah, yeah, I did, yeah.
1460000	1461000	I wondered if I could take you out.
1461000	1462000	Er, let me think about it.
1462000	1464000	I thought, oh, damn it, she went.
1464000	1465000	Yeah, OK, then.
1465000	1466000	That was it.
1466000	1468000	It's such a romantic that you live on the set of Billy Elliot
1468000	1469000	meets Postman Pat.
1471000	1473000	Absolutely brilliant, it was.
1473000	1474000	So, yeah, well done, mate.
1474000	1475000	Well done, you, man.
1475000	1476000	Glad you.
1481000	1482000	Sport with peers.
1482000	1486000	Trotting along the beach, looking vaguely happy with himself.
1486000	1490000	So I think Piers might be off to try and have poo number one.
1490000	1493000	How many days has he been without poo?
1493000	1494000	He's 17.
1495000	1498000	Dr Piers is now the only member of the group
1498000	1500000	who has not yet joined the poo crew.
1502000	1503000	Any luck, mate?
1503000	1504000	No luck today, mate.
1506000	1507000	Here we come.
1508000	1509000	Here he comes.
1509000	1510000	Don't do it.
1510000	1511000	Dr Piers.
1511000	1512000	Dr Piers?
1512000	1513000	Have we succeeded?
1513000	1514000	Is it?
1514000	1515000	Is it?
1515000	1516000	No.
1516000	1517000	Oh, no.
1517000	1518000	No!
1518000	1519000	Mission failure.
1519000	1520000	Oh, no.
1520000	1521000	NASA, we have a problem.
1521000	1522000	Close.
1522000	1523000	Be patient, lads.
1523000	1524000	Be patient.
1524000	1527000	Go in your medical kit, get a rubber glove, because I'm going in.
1534000	1535000	Have fun, boys.
1535000	1536000	Cheers, mate.
1536000	1537000	We'll do our best.
1537000	1538000	Mid-afternoon.
1538000	1540000	After a couple of hours' rest,
1540000	1542000	the men get back to work.
1542000	1543000	Come on, my son.
1543000	1544000	Bite.
1544000	1546000	Two weeks ago, they were dropped on the island
1546000	1548000	with eight fishing hooks,
1548000	1550000	but now they're down to just two.
1551000	1552000	Shit.
1552000	1553000	Could you unsnag my line?
1553000	1554000	I've caught it on the rock.
1555000	1556000	Shit.
1556000	1558000	No, we've lost another rod there, guys.
1558000	1559000	Shit.
1559000	1560000	We've lost a hook.
1562000	1563000	Further down the beach,
1563000	1567000	oil engineer Dan and Dr Piers swim out to check the net.
1567000	1568000	What do we think we've done?
1568000	1569000	Nothing.
1569000	1570000	What do we think, William?
1570000	1572000	Do you think there's going to be anything on there?
1572000	1573000	You're saying it.
1573000	1575000	There's lots of rocks.
1575000	1577000	Anything, Barney?
1577000	1580000	No, sadly not.
1580000	1582000	We're hoping for the nets.
1582000	1584000	So I've got to see this moment.
1592000	1594000	Doesn't look like a trawl.
1594000	1597000	No, I guess far as it says, it looks like the square root of Eiffel.
1597000	1598000	What's wrong?
1599000	1600000	It looks like we'll be going hungry for dinner.
1600000	1601000	Huh?
1601000	1602000	It looks like we'll be eating ass.
1602000	1603000	The nets are empty.
1603000	1604000	Is that right?
1604000	1605000	Shit.
1605000	1606000	What's happening, fella?
1606000	1607000	This is what we've caught.
1607000	1610000	Caught a load of coral.
1610000	1611000	Fuck.
1611000	1616000	The razor sharp coral has taken over the water.
1616000	1617000	It's gone.
1617000	1618000	It's gone.
1618000	1619000	It's gone.
1619000	1620000	It's gone.
1620000	1621000	It's gone.
1621000	1622000	It's gone.
1622000	1623000	It's gone.
1623000	1624000	It's gone.
1624000	1625000	It's gone.
1625000	1626000	It's gone.
1626000	1627000	It's gone.
1627000	1628000	It's gone.
1628000	1630000	The razor sharp coral has destroyed the men's net.
1630000	1631000	No fish at all.
1631000	1632000	Oh.
1632000	1633000	Shit.
1633000	1634000	We really are up Chips Creek, aren't we?
1634000	1635000	With no net, one fishing hook.
1635000	1636000	Situation just went from bad to much, much worse.
1636000	1637000	What do you think, Phil?
1637000	1638000	Well, that's disastrous.
1638000	1639000	That's no food for anyone, and no means to get food.
1639000	1640000	Shit.
1640000	1641000	We've got one hook in the net.
1641000	1642000	Done.
1642000	1643000	Done.
1643000	1644000	Done.
1644000	1645000	Done.
1645000	1646000	Done.
1646000	1647000	Done.
1647000	1648000	Done.
1648000	1649000	Done.
1649000	1650000	Done.
1650000	1651000	Done.
1651000	1652000	Done.
1652000	1653000	Done.
1653000	1654000	Done.
1654000	1655000	Done.
1655000	1656000	Done.
1656000	1657000	Done.
1657000	1660200	Shit, we've got one hook left. We're fucked.
1660240	1663800	So, we've got one hook to fish for a month.
1663840	1666080	It's pretty depressing, yeah? More than one.
1666120	1668000	No joy with nets.
1668040	1670160	Fuck, are we going to be depleted, or what?
1672320	1674240	Disaster.
1674280	1676880	We're down to our last fishing hook.
1676920	1678840	So...
1678880	1681240	the onset of starvation looks upon us.
1687000	1691000	With morale at rock bottom, Barney, Phil and Sam Farmer
1691040	1695160	head out to the lagoon for the daily check of Vic's crocodile traps.
1696920	1700200	Chances of catching a caiman, 4%.
1705600	1707600	The caiman's definitely been here.
1707640	1710920	How do you know that? Because the trap is destroyed.
1710960	1713000	Gosh, look at that.
1713040	1716040	It's almost certain that it's been here for a long time.
1716080	1716960	It's been here for a long time.
1717000	1719960	It's certainly been triggered by a caiman.
1720000	1722960	The bait's gone, the trigger's occurred,
1723000	1724640	and it looks like there's been a bit of a struggle,
1724680	1726920	and the rope is firmly in the water.
1726960	1729320	Well, that is incredibly encouraging in one sense.
1729360	1730560	Very.
1730600	1732360	Is there any chance that the caiman could still be on the end?
1732400	1734360	There is a chance.
1734400	1735200	OK.
1735240	1736280	Fuck, he is.
1736320	1737760	Is he? Shit.
1737800	1739400	I think he's under here, isn't he?
1739440	1741040	Is that his back? No way.
1741080	1742840	Is this his back here?
1742880	1743880	Come here.
1743880	1745880	We need to be a bit careful about this.
1745920	1748000	I can see scales on the back of that rope.
1752080	1757080	I can see there are crocodile or caiman-like scales
1757120	1759400	just underneath the water.
1765440	1767000	I'm convinced... Go and have a look.
1767040	1769000	I'm convinced he's there.
1769040	1770840	Just be careful. Be very careful.
1770880	1771920	He's there.
1771960	1772920	He's there.
1772920	1774400	Just be careful. Be very careful.
1776520	1777960	There's no doubt about it, the caiman's there.
1778000	1779000	Yeah.
1781800	1785520	There is a caiman in the water right next to us now.
1785560	1788120	We need to be careful, cos as soon as we drag him out there,
1788160	1790040	he's going to be angry.
1790080	1791720	I can't quite... I cannot quite believe it.
1791760	1793560	No, I can't either.
1793600	1794840	I cannot believe it.
1797240	1798880	My heart... Mine too.
1798920	1801600	Is your heart beating? Mine too, cos he's obviously alive, right?
1802920	1803920	Yeah.
1803960	1807920	So, the crocodile is the largest, it's the meatiest animal
1807960	1809720	they're going to find on the island.
1809760	1812160	But when they're cornered or they're scared,
1812200	1814320	that's when they're most likely to attack.
1814360	1817400	And if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,
1817440	1818800	you're in trouble.
1818840	1822960	The minute we disturb this, all hell will break loose.
1823000	1824720	The three of us could take him on.
1824760	1826720	I think it's sensible to go and get many more hands.
1826760	1829080	I want you two to stay here. I'll run back to camp.
1829120	1830960	Yeah. Deliver the news. Yeah.
1831000	1832560	And we're going to pull him out of that trap.
1832560	1835680	He's going to fight like buggery. Absolutely.
1835720	1837840	Go on, Barney. Excellent. Yes!
1843400	1846920	Crocodiles can remain submerged for hours before surfacing.
1846960	1850920	And as a lagoon is their ideal habitat,
1850960	1854400	it's certain to be populated by more than just one.
1854440	1858400	There's definitely an alligator moving this way.
1858440	1862520	It's a little bit weird looking at one that could get you right here.
1862560	1867000	And another one that's heading towards you.
1867040	1868600	It's almost like, where the bait?
1870640	1873120	Barney's looking excited. What's up, Barney?
1873160	1874720	OK, come in, come in. Gather in, gather in.
1877200	1878520	OK, so we're...
1883720	1887200	He's ready. I'd say we're 95% sure
1887240	1889160	we've got a caiman in our second trap.
1889200	1892200	Fuck off. Let's rock and roll, boys.
1892240	1892440	Let's rock and roll.
1892560	1893760	Let's rock and roll.
1893800	1895120	I think we nailed it.
1895160	1896880	Let's go. Let's go.
1896920	1900200	Oh, this is exciting. This is exciting.
1900240	1902080	Bingo, big fella.
1902120	1904400	It's either that or a scaly log.
1904440	1906400	A scaly log we will eat.
1906440	1910240	Despite being too exhausted to help with the group's daily tasks,
1910280	1915440	the prospect of a crocodile feast has inspired Kyle to join the hunting pack.
1915480	1916480	Let's do it, lads.
1920480	1922200	I feel like Gandalf with my giant...
1922200	1924200	I feel like Gandalf with my giant shaft.
1929240	1930240	How are you feeling, Barney?
1930280	1932760	It's very difficult because I'm so excited and this is all what we want,
1932800	1935760	but when it comes to actually pulling the animal out and having to kill it,
1935800	1937760	I don't know how I feel at all.
1937800	1939760	For the moment, absolutely buzzing.
1939800	1942120	Yeah, definitely feel like a tribe on a hunt.
1942160	1943120	Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
1943160	1945480	Everyone's come out prepared.
1945520	1949000	Oh, this is the most excitement I've felt since I've bloody been here.
1949040	1950160	How are you feeling, Vic?
1950200	1952080	I'm feeling excited.
1952080	1956080	But we've got a job to do, we dispatch it in a humane manner as we can.
1956120	1958640	But, woohoo, that's how I'm feeling.
1960680	1964600	When you're hunting crocs, you've got to make sure that you don't become the prey
1964640	1967280	because these prehistoric beasts are fast.
1967320	1970880	Once they get a hold of you, grab you, drag you into the water,
1970920	1975320	then they strike, bam, lightning speed and incredible power.
1978760	1980960	What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.
1981000	1981920	What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.
1981920	1982760	What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.
1982800	1985200	This thing is going to go absolutely mental.
1985240	1987640	Absolutely mental when it comes out.
1987680	1990800	Such a blessing. It's a dangerous animal, but we need the food.
1990840	1992120	We need the food.
1992160	1994800	This way, guys. Barney.
1994840	1996560	I've got the cavalry.
1996600	1998840	Putting on the cavalry.
1998880	2000040	Where is it?
2000080	2003920	It literally is just where you can see that blue rope by the log.
2003960	2006080	The blue rope is wrapped around the caiman.
2006120	2008560	Oh!
2008600	2010120	He's big, boys, he's big.
2010160	2011120	OK, he's moving.
2011120	2013400	We need to get a loop over that mouth.
2013440	2016080	I think one of these branches has him pinned.
2016120	2019600	He's making bubbles, I think he's going to do something.
2019640	2020800	Here we go, there we go.
2020840	2022400	Look at that beauty.
2022440	2023400	He needs to breathe, doesn't he?
2023440	2025320	He's hissing at us.
2025360	2028280	OK, he's trying to go back.
2028320	2029840	Here we go, boys.
2029880	2031240	Right, where's that rope with the hook?
2031280	2032760	Here, look, look.
2032800	2035320	OK, boys, we need two people on that rope.
2035360	2037000	We need to pull him ashore.
2037040	2038240	Is his mouth open?
2038280	2040920	His mouth is slightly open.
2040920	2042200	OK, big.
2042240	2045400	Nice and calmly, boys.
2045440	2046880	Come on, big.
2046920	2048440	Whoa, come on, baby.
2048480	2049440	Come on, big.
2052440	2054440	Right, nobody moves, his mouth's open.
2054480	2057440	Yeah, you get him, you get him.
2057480	2058960	You fucking get him.
2059000	2062040	Round his neck, round his neck.
2062080	2064040	That's it, we got you, little sod.
2064080	2065040	Come on, big boy.
2065080	2067040	Come on, boys, come on.
2067080	2069040	Right, I'll distract him.
2069080	2070040	Hey, Mr Croc.
2070080	2070760	Hey.
2070760	2073640	Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me.
2073680	2076000	Ooh, ooh, ooh.
2076040	2078200	OK, OK, Vic, go now, go now.
2078240	2079760	He's probably going to roll soon.
2079800	2081320	Over the teeth, over the teeth.
2081360	2083040	Oh, branch, one more, one more.
2083080	2084160	Mate, mate, mate, you've almost got it.
2084200	2085880	Watch him, watch him, go now, go now.
2088680	2090320	You're in, you're in, you're in, you're in, you're in.
2090360	2091520	Here we go, puppy dog.
2091560	2093600	Yes, yes.
2093640	2094600	Ah, you little fucker.
2094640	2096920	Watch him, watch him.
2096960	2099240	Right, Sam, I'm very conscious of you stood in the water, mate.
2099280	2100200	There is another one in that lake.
2100200	2101440	Yeah, get out of there.
2101480	2102640	Yeah, get on the bank, Sam.
2106440	2107520	Sam, Sam.
2107560	2109040	Sam, watch his tail.
2109080	2110280	Sam, get out of the water, mate.
2110320	2111640	Mate, mate, I think we're good.
2111680	2113760	No, see, there is another one in this lake.
2113800	2115840	If he came along and nipped your heel...
2115880	2118040	Let's just fucking get this guy.
2118080	2119880	Have we got enough people tugging on that rope?
2119920	2121520	Yeah, yeah, Charles has got it.
2121560	2122480	There we go.
2122520	2123760	Right, we now have two.
2123800	2125360	That's it.
2125400	2126840	He can still snap, can't he?
2126880	2128680	Watch his tail on your legs.
2128720	2130040	I am on it, I'm on it, don't worry.
2130200	2131040	All right.
2131080	2132480	And again, Barney, and again, Barney.
2132520	2134160	No, no, no, look what it's snagged on now.
2134200	2135600	Right, it's snagged on this one.
2135640	2137000	Take your time, fellas.
2137040	2139600	Right, don't cut the rope.
2141440	2143480	Oh, shit, he's growling.
2143520	2145280	This fucker is fucking powerful.
2145320	2146120	Give him a minute.
2146160	2147960	I think he speaks English.
2148000	2148960	Where's the knife?
2149000	2149800	I've got a knife with me.
2149840	2151120	Get the knife out ready.
2151160	2153000	And then, Kyle, what are you doing?
2153040	2154680	You're going to drive the knife, take him out.
2154720	2156320	Right, where are you going to put it?
2156360	2158480	Just behind his eyes, let's go.
2158520	2160080	Heads on, guys, heads on, heads on.
2160200	2161320	We go on go.
2161360	2162960	One, two, three, we all go on go.
2165160	2166160	One.
2168920	2171400	Two, three, go.
2172360	2174280	Come on, boys, get in there, get in there.
2174320	2176000	Drive it out, drive it out.
2176040	2177800	Go on, lads, push it in.
2177840	2179720	Push it, lads, that's the one, boys.
2179760	2180760	That's it, that's it.
2182880	2184120	Yes, mate, yes.
2184160	2185640	That's it.
2185680	2188360	Gentlemen, we have handbags.
2188400	2189320	Come on.
2189360	2190000	Nice teamwork.
2190000	2191200	Look them down, boys.
2191240	2191920	Come on.
2191960	2193560	Come on, boys.
2193600	2194520	Back it up.
2194560	2196160	Come on, boys.
2196200	2199600	Oh, he's twitching, he's twitching, he's moving.
2199640	2201800	Kyle, fucking killer blow, mate.
2201840	2204000	That was awesome.
2204040	2205560	Get in there, boys.
2205600	2206840	Woo!
2206880	2208400	Actually wrapping up a dinosaur.
2208440	2211520	We just caught a prehistoric animal.
2211560	2212760	Damn it.
2212800	2213520	Amazing.
2213560	2214400	It feels so caveman.
2214440	2215080	Doesn't it?
2215120	2216280	Doesn't it feel so caveman?
2216320	2217080	Yes.
2220000	2222080	If Fierce doesn't shit after eating a load of this,
2222120	2223320	he's got a serious problem.
2223360	2224360	I know, just.
2229280	2232160	How many people in the world can say,
2232200	2234200	wrestle the crocodile that killed him?
2234240	2236360	We are in an elite group of blokes.
2236400	2239880	After 17 days without anything substantial to eat,
2239920	2242520	the men have finally hit the jackpot
2242560	2245520	and dispatched one of nature's most fearsome predators.
2245560	2248120	Seeing this, it does make you have respect for crocodiles.
2248160	2249680	This is a big one, really big one.
2249680	2251520	So I just wanted to get it done in a clean way
2251560	2252720	without making a mess of it.
2252760	2255400	To pull it off and grab a croc like this is amazing.
2255440	2256600	Should we rock and roll then, boys?
2256640	2257400	Yeah.
2257440	2260560	One, two, three, up.
2260600	2261160	Kyle.
2261200	2261840	Yeah.
2261880	2264240	What would you be doing in your normal life right now?
2264280	2266200	Back home, it'd be a bit more mundane than this.
2266240	2269320	I definitely wouldn't have a croc on my shoulders.
2269360	2272360	Seriously, look how much meat there is on that bad boy.
2272400	2275480	Fucking awesome.
2275520	2276840	Not only have the men proved
2276880	2278960	that they're top of the island's food chain,
2278960	2282320	but after surviving on roughly 400 or 500 calories a day,
2282360	2287000	suddenly they've landed themselves a feast of just epic proportions.
2287040	2290120	Just think of that fucking delicious dinner we're going to have later, boys.
2290160	2293840	News of the big catch soon spreads around the island.
2293880	2296080	Come on, fellas.
2296120	2297840	Oh, my God.
2297880	2299920	Holy shit.
2299960	2302000	Oh, my God.
2302040	2305240	No fucking way.
2305280	2308440	You are absolutely shitting me.
2308440	2311760	That is absolutely enormous.
2314680	2317640	That's amazing, isn't it?
2317680	2319800	That is amazing.
2322800	2323640	Woo-hoo!
2323680	2324960	Keep going, lads.
2325000	2327720	Fucking hell.
2327760	2330080	And roll, roll.
2330120	2331320	Get in there, boys.
2331360	2334240	Yeah!
2334280	2335280	Woo!
2335320	2336280	Yeah!
2336320	2337280	Yeah!
2337320	2338240	Yeah!
2338440	2339440	Woo-hoo!
2339480	2340440	Come on, lads!
2340480	2341440	Come on, lads!
2346560	2348840	A crock of this size could provide the men
2348880	2350960	with tens of thousands of calories.
2352840	2354640	What do you think of that, big boy?
2354680	2356760	That's beautiful.
2356800	2358280	Give some respect to him.
2358320	2361560	Out of the water, trapped, dispatched, we in 15, 20 minutes.
2361600	2362560	Yeah.
2362600	2363560	That's brilliant.
2363600	2364600	I'm pleased about that.
2364640	2366800	We were very respectful of her.
2366840	2368400	Oh, my God.
2368440	2371040	I think I can see a plate of meat coming along.
2371080	2372360	Oh, hello.
2372400	2373680	Look at this, boys.
2373720	2375680	As if you didn't need any more motivation.
2378360	2382000	Today, I managed to catch a bloody crocodile.
2382040	2384080	And my God, was it something.
2384120	2388600	I'm normally at a desk or on a phone talking to clients.
2388640	2391440	I don't kill crocodiles.
2392440	2393840	Carl, look at that.
2393880	2394840	Oh, mate.
2394880	2395880	Get in.
2395920	2397440	Unbelievable.
2397480	2398360	Wow.
2398440	2400880	Look at that.
2400920	2402960	Let the feast begin, boys.
2403000	2404960	Yes.
2405000	2406720	Boys get stuck in, it's like chicken.
2409280	2410280	That is wonderful.
2416800	2420560	Just had my first taste of crocodile.
2420600	2424080	To me, it just tasted absolutely divine.
2424120	2426920	It's nice to have a mouthful of meat, isn't it?
2426960	2428080	Not just a nibble.
2428080	2430560	We all get more than we can possibly eat.
2430600	2432240	Here's the heart.
2432280	2434160	This is Kyle's, the killer.
2434200	2437640	Kyle, salute you, sir.
2437680	2441120	Based on the fact that I killed the croc,
2441160	2443400	I was given the privilege of eating his heart.
2443440	2445400	It felt like a good feeling.
2445440	2449600	Almost like a prize for doing a good job.
2449640	2450600	Go on, Kyle.
2453520	2455040	I feel like you're inheriting its strength.
2455080	2456040	Like a boss.
2456080	2456600	Yeah.
2456600	2458360	Oh, f**k, that was nice.
2458400	2459520	God, that was nice.
2459560	2462880	Oh, that second piece I took was beautiful.
2464920	2467640	Oh, God, I feel like it's after Sunday dinner at home.
2469800	2471920	Absolutely lovely.
2471960	2474120	What a lovely, lovely feeling that is.
2476560	2478000	I feel sorry for Piers,
2478040	2479480	because he needs to open his bowels,
2479520	2481200	otherwise it's going to be painful.
2481240	2484040	Oh, he's going to open them after this.
2484080	2486400	So I was absolutely dead on my feet.
2486400	2490320	I was completely and utterly gone.
2490360	2494880	And suddenly, the morale boost the team needed,
2494920	2499320	needed that so badly, to kick the spirits up.
2499360	2502320	I think this counts as just for today,
2502360	2504320	if nothing else, more than surviving.
2512360	2513680	6am.
2513720	2515520	MUSIC PLAYS
2515520	2519200	Dr Piers is feeling the benefit of last night's feast.
2524120	2525880	Here, you've got some big news for me.
2525920	2529440	Yeah, I am the last member of the poo club.
2529480	2531160	Well done, Piers.
2531200	2533320	Do you want to give Piers a round of applause?
2533360	2534400	Yes!
2534440	2535440	Yes, Piers.
2535480	2536440	Brilliant.
2536480	2537920	Yes, Piers.
2537960	2538880	How did it feel?
2538920	2540560	It felt great, actually.
2540600	2541520	Really good.
2541560	2543600	I thought it was going to be really hard.
2543640	2545480	I thought it was going to be like rabbit droppings.
2545520	2546800	It's stuck together.
2546840	2548720	Oh, what was it like?
2548760	2550160	Like a wet sausage.
2550200	2551160	A wet sausage?
2551200	2552160	Yeah.
2552200	2553160	Dreamy.
2553200	2554400	Absolutely dreamy.
2554440	2555400	Yeah.
2555440	2556880	It's that crock pushed it all down.
2560560	2562520	Lads, crock's ready.
2563920	2566840	With plenty of crocodile meat still left over,
2566880	2569920	cameraman Ross serves up breakfast.
2569960	2572760	Char-grilled to smoky perfection.
2572800	2574600	Oh, that's good, isn't it?
2574600	2575840	I think it's better.
2575880	2577720	I think it's better than yesterday.
2584120	2587600	With their bellies full, the men set about their daily chores.
2589080	2590080	Look at that.
2590120	2595400	We have done wood in the same time it took Kyle to get dressed.
2595440	2597200	Tell me that ain't the greatest thing.
2597240	2599560	Right, right.
2599600	2600920	Team effort, boys.
2604600	2608080	I feel like I can just lie on this beach right now
2608120	2610080	and think about nothing and do nothing
2610120	2613080	and not feel guilty for the first time pretty much since we got here.
2613120	2615080	Does this feel personal collection, though?
2615120	2616080	This is only for me.
2616120	2617080	I thought so, mate.
2617120	2618080	A bit slower.
2618120	2619080	I thought that.
2619120	2620080	A bit slower.
2620120	2621080	That's it.
2621120	2622080	That's it.
2622120	2623080	It's working.
2623120	2624080	Oh, what?
2624120	2625080	That's it.
2625120	2626080	That's it.
2626120	2627080	That's it.
2627120	2628120	That's it.
2628160	2629160	That's it.
2629200	2630200	That's it.
2630240	2631240	That's it.
2631280	2632280	That's it.
2632320	2633320	That's it.
2633360	2634440	That's it.
2634600	2635600	That's it.
2635640	2636640	Lovely.
2636680	2640640	Enjoy the idyllic tropical sunshine.
2640680	2642640	I think life isn't too bad after all.
2651160	2652880	For the second night in a row,
2652920	2656480	the men anticipate a hearty feast of crocodile meat.
2656520	2658760	Does everyone fancy the last of the crock?
2658800	2660920	I would love a bit.
2660960	2663320	As well as giving the group vital calories,
2663320	2665280	the sudden intake of rich food
2665320	2668040	appears to have solved another of the men's problems.
2668080	2672360	Dan, how were your ablutions this afternoon?
2672400	2675080	Danny had a trump and a fall of food, didn't he?
2675120	2677800	He shit himself this afternoon while he was making his bed.
2677840	2678800	It's dribbling down my legs.
2678840	2679800	Just a little bit.
2679840	2681440	A little bit of boo came out.
2681480	2682720	I had to squeeze my socks out.
2682760	2683720	Who's that by the way?
2683760	2684720	Oh, God.
2684760	2686360	Well, you fucking arsed, didn't you?
2688360	2691400	Crocodile broth this evening.
2691440	2693280	It's going to be superb.
2693360	2695320	Come on, boys, dig in, please.
2695360	2696360	Pass it round.
2698880	2699880	How is it, Vic?
2699920	2700920	Oh, it's strong.
2702440	2704040	I think strong is a good word.
2704080	2706280	There is some distinct smell of poo about this.
2706320	2707840	It smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it?
2707880	2709600	It does smell a bit suspicious, doesn't it?
2709640	2710600	Yeah.
2710640	2711600	Shit.
2711640	2712920	Oh, crikey.
2712960	2714440	Phil, what's the verdict?
2714480	2717360	I've had two mouthfuls and that's two mouthfuls too many.
2717400	2718840	I can feel the squirts coming on.
2720480	2722200	The 30-degree tropical heat
2722240	2723160	is making the food smell.
2723320	2726320	The meat has spoiled the remains of the crocodile,
2726360	2730320	leaving the men, once again, with nothing to eat.
2730360	2733680	The final meal of my croc, it was basically rotten meat.
2733720	2735120	It was pretty...
2736360	2737360	Like it?
2738880	2740960	I don't want to think about it too much.
2742360	2745400	It was pretty much the worst thing I've ever had in my life.
2746640	2748080	Oh. Oh, dear.
2749400	2750520	Oh!
2750560	2751840	Mind your shoulder, Piers.
2751880	2752760	Yeah?
2754160	2758160	Well, tonight marked the end of our crocodile feast.
2758200	2760600	From now on, we've got no more meat to eat.
2760640	2762800	Now that crocodile has dried up,
2762840	2765200	we need another source of food in Highland.
2765240	2767440	Oh, my God! What's that?
2767480	2769560	Is that Andrew? Oh, my God!
2769600	2771240	Next time on The Women's Island...
2771280	2772600	Oh, my God.
2772640	2774120	Oh, my God!
2774160	2775840	..thoughts turn to food.
2775880	2777640	I think a boogie just came out of my nose.
2777680	2779320	Eat it, it's worth nothing!
2779360	2781920	Oh, my God, there's two piglets!
2781960	2783160	The first thing I thought of was crocodile.
2783160	2784760	I thought it was me Force Quackling.
2788000	2792760	.
2792840	2801160	.
2801200	2807480	.
2807520	2809800	.
2809840	2810920	.
2810960	2811960	.
2812000	2812920	.
