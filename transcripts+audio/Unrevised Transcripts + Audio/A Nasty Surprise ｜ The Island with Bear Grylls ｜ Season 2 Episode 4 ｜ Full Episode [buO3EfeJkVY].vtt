00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.640 --> 00:22.640
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll

00:22.640 --> 00:29.640
be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming

00:29.640 --> 00:37.500
everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

00:37.500 --> 00:48.180
strength the winds of day who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the

00:48.180 --> 00:57.840
women's island this time it'll be harder than ever

00:59.640 --> 01:09.780
hunt for food find water and build shelter living on the island in the middle of tropical storm

01:09.780 --> 01:26.880
season when pitted against the extremes of nature and these Monday women got what it takes to survive

01:29.640 --> 01:47.100
four days ago 14 British women were cast away on this remote uninhabited Pacific Island

01:47.100 --> 01:54.660
already one woman has left the island I need to go

01:54.660 --> 01:58.980
who's up for this

01:59.640 --> 02:05.280
some of the group stayed behind at the makeshift camp whilst an expedition party went in search of

02:05.280 --> 02:14.160
a permanent base with a sustainable water source it's not salty but with no idea how to get back

02:14.160 --> 02:23.700
to the others they are now lost in the thick of the jungle and are completely out of water

02:23.700 --> 02:27.900
we have nothing to drink we don't know where we are

02:29.640 --> 02:35.520
the women left behind have just rain water to drink their fire has gone out and panic is setting in

02:35.520 --> 02:45.480
with both groups now starving and critically dehydrated their time on the island could be

02:45.480 --> 02:51.360
over before it's really begun it's day four

02:53.280 --> 02:58.800
the five women left in camp have been waiting for over 24 hours for the others to return from their

02:58.800 --> 02:59.280
expedition

02:59.640 --> 03:10.080
I feel dreadful honestly I feel absolutely dreadful I never thought I would be so desperate

03:10.080 --> 03:18.240
for food and water we all want to get out of this camp but we know the other group are coming back

03:18.240 --> 03:24.180
for us we can't set off because we'll lose them the women are trying to relight their fire to

03:24.180 --> 03:27.900
purify water from a muddy puddle but their wood is damp

03:27.900 --> 03:29.280
that's it

03:29.640 --> 03:34.800
next it's moving oh every time what the hell are we doing there's actually just another

03:34.800 --> 03:41.160
Groundhog Day of the same it's like the best camping ever isn't it the best camping

03:41.160 --> 03:48.000
every time camping twice I don't like it

03:51.900 --> 03:55.640

03:55.640 --> 03:56.040

you'll get started until you hit the video this one walk

03:59.340 --> 04:03.940
surviving. You know, simple principles that really make a big difference, and one of those

04:03.940 --> 04:08.780
is positivity, positivity, positivity.

04:08.780 --> 04:13.500
I might as well, honestly, I might as well have gone and sat in my horse's field for

04:13.500 --> 04:17.660
five days and not eaten, but just sat in the muddiest part of the horse's field, but the

04:17.660 --> 04:20.180
difference is I might have had a horse for company.

04:20.180 --> 04:28.180
I don't actually mind, because I love extremes of weather. I like roaring wind and lightning

04:28.180 --> 04:30.180
and torrential rain and...

04:30.180 --> 04:34.940
Oh, lovely. I'm pleased for you. Seriously, I'm really chuffed for you.

04:34.940 --> 04:40.460
I've always wanted an adventure, and I thank God I haven't done that much for myself over

04:40.460 --> 04:46.060
the last 55 years. Should have done more. Should have seen more.

04:46.060 --> 04:50.860
I get really wound up over the most stupid things. Like, you know when you buy expensive

04:50.860 --> 04:57.860
toilet roll and then you tear it and it doesn't tear along the perforations? That really winds

04:58.180 --> 04:59.180
me up.

04:59.180 --> 05:05.620
I try to stop myself talking a lot, but I do like to think that other people can get

05:05.620 --> 05:09.620
away with it in edgeways, you know what I mean?

05:09.620 --> 05:15.220
This is day four now without any food, so we're really going to feel it today.

05:15.220 --> 05:21.180
Earlier, the women found some yucca, a type of potato. Mother of two, Julie, has decided

05:21.180 --> 05:24.860
to peel it, despite not having a fire to cook it on.

05:24.860 --> 05:28.180
Oh, now, do you know what? I've just wasted that now.

05:28.180 --> 05:33.180
But we could have boiled it in soup, that's what Beth was saying.

05:33.180 --> 05:36.180
I would please leave the yucca.

05:36.180 --> 05:41.180
If she goes on about those potatoes anymore, I'm going to stab her.

05:48.180 --> 05:55.180
After 24 hours without a drink, the expedition party are dehydrated, hopelessly lost, and

05:55.180 --> 05:57.180
wandering directionless.

05:58.180 --> 06:05.180
Walking is painful now, physically and mentally.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.180
I just hope we can find a drink.

06:08.180 --> 06:17.180
I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.

06:17.180 --> 06:19.180
Careful here, guys, it's really slippery.

06:19.180 --> 06:21.180
Oh, shit.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.180
Are you all right?

06:22.180 --> 06:23.180
Super slippery.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.180
Really slippery.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.180
Oh, God.

06:25.180 --> 06:26.180
Oh, .

06:26.180 --> 06:27.180
Hey.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.180
Who was that?

06:28.180 --> 06:29.180
That was me.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.180
Oh, my God, there's a caiman.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.180
That is a big .

06:31.180 --> 06:32.180
Oh, yes, I can see it.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.180
Straight ahead.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.180
Oh, shit.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.180
Oh, my God, that's .

06:35.180 --> 06:36.180
Yeah, it's enormous.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.180
It's watching us, though.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.180
We actually, I just can't, I literally must have walked past his nose by that much.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.180
Didn't spot him.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.180
Did we throw things at his hip?

06:40.180 --> 06:41.180
No.

06:41.180 --> 06:42.180
No.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.180
Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size is the most likely

06:43.180 --> 06:44.180
to die.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.180
Oh, my God.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.180
Oh, my God.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.180
Oh, my God.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.180
Oh, my God.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.180
Oh, my God.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.180
Oh, my God.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.180
Oh, my God.

06:51.180 --> 06:52.180
Oh, my God.

06:52.180 --> 06:53.180
Oh, my God.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.180
Oh, my God.

06:54.180 --> 06:59.020
Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size could provide tens of thousands

06:59.020 --> 07:02.180
of calories for the women who have barely eaten in days.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.180
Billy Big Balls, that.

07:03.180 --> 07:04.180
That is a serious Billy Big Ball.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.180
I'm not going for that one for dinner, then.

07:05.180 --> 07:06.180
Not tonight, not without a fire.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
We wouldn't tackle that unless we don't have a sharp knife on us.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.180
We'll be back for you, men.

07:08.180 --> 07:09.180
Sleep with one eye open.

07:09.180 --> 07:21.420
With hunger and dehydration sapping their energy and with hunting equipment left at camp,

07:21.420 --> 07:24.180
the women decide to walk away from this potentially deadly crocodile.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.180
A life-saving feast.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.180
Right, let's get out of here.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.180
Nothing easy on this.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.180
Hey, it's all right.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.180
It's all right.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.180
It's all right.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.180
That's it.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.180
That's it.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.180
That's it.

07:33.180 --> 07:34.180
Well done.

07:34.180 --> 07:39.180
As we know, caiman can take off a leg, an arm, drag you into the water, drown you,

07:39.180 --> 07:40.180
eat you.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.180
Not great, really.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.180
So we all want to be out of here as fast as possible.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.180
And as an exit operation, we're doing quite well.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.180
Oh, darn you, dear.

07:48.180 --> 07:49.180
Yeah.

07:49.180 --> 07:50.180
Too late.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.180
Too late, baby.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.180
Too late, baby.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.180
Too late, baby.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.180
Too late, baby.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.180
It's too late.

07:55.180 --> 08:01.180
For these women to succeed they've got to have faith.

08:01.180 --> 08:06.180
They've got to persevere and reunite because there's power in numbers.

08:06.180 --> 08:10.180
My mantra is lead no man behind.

08:10.180 --> 08:15.180
It's that sort of attitude that's going to make the critical difference for them.

08:15.180 --> 08:18.180
I've got a beach on my left.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.180
Oh, no.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.180
Let's get on that.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.180
Let's get an orientation.

08:23.180 --> 08:26.540
The women have been trekking through the jungle for two hours,

08:26.780 --> 08:28.440
but instead of finding camp,

08:28.780 --> 08:31.860
they've stumbled upon another beach on the north of the island.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.880
This is so hard.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.360
No-one knows what the right decision is.

08:38.380 --> 08:39.500
It's so thirsty.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.400
I've never been so dehydrated in all my life.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.560
I'm thinking about drinking seawater.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.360
I know you can't, but I'm not...

08:49.360 --> 08:53.940
The women scavenge the area and strike lucky.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.180
We found coconut!

08:55.800 --> 08:56.420
Oh, my God!

08:58.320 --> 09:00.460
It's just enough to keep them going.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.760
Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's do it.

09:03.180 --> 09:06.660
As they head back into the jungle to try and find the others once more.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.700
At camp, the damp conditions are proving problematic.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.620
I really...

09:18.620 --> 09:19.340
I was, of course, trying to say,

09:19.360 --> 09:20.060
let's start another fire.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.320
It's finding the dry stuff.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.660
There's no sun. We can't see the sky.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.480
Oh, but look at your little hands.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.180
My hands. I'm like...

09:28.180 --> 09:28.540
Can you see?

09:28.900 --> 09:29.540
Like, look.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.520
It's just from the wetness.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.480
They're going to crack.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.520
I'm in agony.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.960
I've achieved everything I wanted to in my profession.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.620
I'm really happy with where I've got to,

09:41.740 --> 09:44.240
but I think my job is starting to define me,

09:44.680 --> 09:45.740
and I don't want that.

09:45.740 --> 09:48.220
I want to find out who I am again.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.580
I think I have a need for adventure.

09:51.820 --> 09:56.380
I just feel so driven to do something completely different.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.600
It's crazy.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.720
I can't let it get in my head.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.460
You can't let it get in your head.

10:04.640 --> 10:04.860
No.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.360
It's important to be positive.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.140
Right.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.060
It will work out. It will.

10:09.180 --> 10:12.620
We're about to work out how to make a great shelter today.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.580
Unable to make fire without dry wood,

10:17.580 --> 10:20.340
a shelter will protect the women from the elements

10:20.340 --> 10:22.860
while they wait for the others to come back for them.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.060
Push it down. Push that down.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.780
No. No, this, the top one. Push that down.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.320
I'll tell you what, there really is strength in numbers.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.800
You really feel that there's so much more work

10:33.800 --> 10:35.000
and so much more pressure on you

10:35.000 --> 10:36.560
when there's just a small amount of you.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.940
Oh, shit. That's it. There we go.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.880
Now, with just five of us, it feels pretty lonely, actually.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.940
Half an hour later,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.180
and the shape of a shelter is almost complete.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.180
It looks pretty good.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.180
Oh, for fuck's sake.

10:57.180 --> 11:00.180
Positivity, positivity, positivity.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.180
The expedition party left what they've nicknamed Coconut Beach

11:08.180 --> 11:10.180
nearly two hours ago,

11:10.180 --> 11:12.180
and they are trekking into the thick of the jungle,

11:12.180 --> 11:14.180
trying to find a camp.

11:14.180 --> 11:16.180
No, we're going back on ourselves. We need to go that way.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.080
There's the other coast beach.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.080
With the afternoon temperature rising to over 30 degrees...

11:22.080 --> 11:24.080
I'm so thirsty.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.080
..their need for water is more critical than ever.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.080
My biggest motivation is to get to the others.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.080
Convinced they're close to camp,

11:37.080 --> 11:40.080
Georgie and Lauren go ahead to recce their surroundings.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
We're just looking.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
They're not going anywhere.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.080
We're going back to where we are.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.080
We're back to where we are.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.080
No fucking way.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Can't be.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.080
We are?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.080
No, we can't be.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
We haven't done one massive se...

11:54.080 --> 11:55.080
Yeah.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.080
Really?

12:00.080 --> 12:04.080
The expedition party have spent all day in the searing heat,

12:04.080 --> 12:07.080
only to find they've walked in one big circle,

12:07.080 --> 12:09.080
back to Coconut Beach.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.360
in one big circle, back to Coconut Beach.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.200
Guys, do you want to come down?

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
OK.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.600
Without a GPS or visual landmarks to guide us,

12:21.680 --> 12:24.520
human beings are naturally prone to walk in circles,

12:24.600 --> 12:27.480
even when we're convinced we're going in a straight line.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.520
Put dehydration into the mix, which slows down brain function

12:31.600 --> 12:34.120
and the women find themselves in crisis.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.960
OK, so there's some bad, bad news.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.400
We're back where we were.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.920
If the women don't find a proper water source soon,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
their time on the island will end.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.480
Bad news is we fucked up and we've just done a massive circle

12:47.560 --> 12:49.680
and we've wasted a load of energy for nothing.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.760
How the fuck did that happen?

12:51.840 --> 12:52.960
All too easily.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.200
We're in the jungle.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.640
Got no fucking reference point.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.120
And we're tired and dehydrated.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.320
I vote we bed in for the night.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.840
I think I'm going to cry, George.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.240
I think I'm going to cry, don't you?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.680
This is absolutely fucking ludicrous.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.800
Physically, I don't know, people have got holes in their feet.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.960
I have now.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.400
We can't sustain this.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.160
Oh, my God, what are we going to do back at the camp?

13:18.280 --> 13:22.160
Four days ago, I abandoned a group of ordinary British women

13:22.240 --> 13:24.960
on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.480
After separating over 24 hours ago,

13:27.560 --> 13:31.720
the expedition party are desperately trying to get back to camp.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.880
But disorientated by the jungle,

13:33.960 --> 13:36.160
they remain in the north of the island.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.720
The women left waiting at camp have no fire to purify water

13:42.800 --> 13:45.400
and are also worryingly dehydrated.

13:48.960 --> 13:55.400
We've been drinking water from a roof by wild animals.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.600
Mum of two, Julie, has been down at the rocks

13:59.680 --> 14:01.720
washing the women's muddy underwear.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.600
There's only five of us here at the moment.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.920
The other group have got lost.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.680
We've no idea where they are.

14:08.760 --> 14:14.440
A couple of our groupers are just moaning all the time.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.960
I mean, for God's sake, it's supposed to be survival.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.240
It's not supposed to be a holiday.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.120
You know what I mean? We knew it was going to be tough.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.040
Facing a second night isolated from the others...

14:26.120 --> 14:28.000
What the fuck?

14:28.080 --> 14:30.320
..the claustrophobic jungle environment

14:30.400 --> 14:32.720
is testing the women's mental strength.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.920
But it's been very difficult to stay positive.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.880
I don't feel we've got anything.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
I don't have anything to look forward to.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.320
I just feel like we've been dumped.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.240
Can I say something positive?

14:42.320 --> 14:43.920
No, fuck off.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.360
I don't feel too bad, you know?

14:46.440 --> 14:49.800
And I just think it can only get better.

14:49.880 --> 14:54.280
To be fair, Julie, you really haven't gone on any expeditions to get anything.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.960
You've kind of conserved the energy by staying in camp the most of the time.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.000
You are good at talking the talk, let's do this, let's do that,

15:01.080 --> 15:03.600
but actually actively doing it is a different story.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.760
Maybe that's why you're feeling so good.

15:05.840 --> 15:06.720
I appreciate it.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.080
Everybody is really fucking pissed off.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.720
All I said was a bit of positivity.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.320
I've spent fucking hours rearranging wet knickers

15:17.400 --> 15:18.680
and washing all around this camp.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.880
I don't want you to do that, Julie!

15:19.960 --> 15:22.520
And squeezing it out and hanging it up for you.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.560
I've been biting my tongue all the time.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.240
You don't want me to do it?

15:26.320 --> 15:29.440
Personally, I feel that constantly wringing out people's knickers

15:29.520 --> 15:31.880
that aren't even here in other clothes is futile.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.040
The group dynamics of these five people is not working.

15:36.120 --> 15:36.840
Yeah.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.960
It's not productive.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.760
And I'm sat here thinking, I am stuck with this.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.760
But we collected it at night as well, Julie, but you just walked with us.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.880
How the fuck do you keep a fire going then?

15:47.960 --> 15:49.120
You're not listening to me, are you?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.800
Do you know what? I'm not, you're right.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.040
What I'm saying is, we should collect wood and...

15:54.120 --> 15:55.640
So, I'm doing the selfie now,

15:55.720 --> 15:57.760
because you really need to know how I'm feeling.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.680
It's really hard.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.000
I just can't get enough of the photoshoots.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.320
We can't eat.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.240
Because we have no fire.

16:36.840 --> 16:41.060
I don't know where everyone else is, the other group have gone missing and I'm really worried

16:41.060 --> 16:57.580
about them, but I'm just questioning how on earth are we expected to survive in this?

16:57.580 --> 17:03.000
On Coconut Beach in the north of the island, the expedition party remain out of water and

17:03.000 --> 17:07.880
have decided to stay the night.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.120
They're building a makeshift shelter.

17:10.120 --> 17:15.820
We've basically spent two days walking for four and a half hours, that's nine hours in

17:15.820 --> 17:20.120
total we've spent walking around this bloody island trying to get back to where we started.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.120
Everybody's very dehydrated.

17:21.120 --> 17:27.320
We've not had actual water for two days, it's just, it's ridiculous.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.320
It's absolutely ridiculous.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.320
And then the other side would go like that?

17:30.320 --> 17:31.320
Yeah, brilliant.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
And then the other side would go like that?

17:32.320 --> 17:32.820
Yeah, brilliant.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.380
After spotting a storm on the horizon, the women scavenge the beach for containers to

17:38.380 --> 17:41.380
collect rainwater, their only hope of rehydrating.

17:41.380 --> 17:46.380
We're going to have to support the bottles and this polystyrene thing so that they're

17:46.380 --> 17:47.380
upright and they don't spill.

17:47.380 --> 17:54.660
And we may have to keep it behind the slug so that the tide doesn't wash it out.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.140
Finding fresh water is so important.

17:57.140 --> 18:02.800
That combination of very oppressive 30 degree heat plus the humidity, you know, over 90%

18:02.800 --> 18:05.180
of the time, it can easily mean the women get through a litre of water an hour.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.180
That is a lot.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.180
Unless they find water, I reckon the women only have one more day.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.180
As night draws in, the women abandoned at camp are attempting to light a new fire to

18:08.180 --> 18:09.180
purify their muddy rainwater.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.180
Remember, all we're doing now is trying to make a hole.

18:10.180 --> 18:11.180
It's out, it's out.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.180
Oh, fuck's sake.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.180
It's out.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.180
It's out.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.180
It's out.

18:15.180 --> 18:16.180
It's out.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.180
It's out.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.180
It's out.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.180
It's out.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
It's out.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.180
It's out.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.180
It's out.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.180
It's out.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.180
It's out.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.180
It's out.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.180
It's out.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.180
It's out.

18:27.180 --> 18:28.180
It's out.

18:28.180 --> 18:29.180
It's out.

18:29.180 --> 18:30.180
It's out.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.180
It's out.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.180
It's out.

18:32.180 --> 18:33.180
It's out.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.180
It's out.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.180
It's out.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.180
It's out.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.180
It's out.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.180
It's out.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.180
It's out.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.180
It's out.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.180
It's out.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.180
It's out.

18:42.180 --> 18:43.180
It's out.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.180
It's out.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.180
It's out.

18:45.180 --> 18:46.180
It's out.

18:46.180 --> 18:47.180
It's out.

18:47.180 --> 18:48.180
It's out.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.180
It's out.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.180
It's out.

18:50.180 --> 18:51.180
It's out.

18:51.180 --> 18:52.180
It's out.

18:52.180 --> 18:53.180
It's out.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.180
It's out.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.180
It's out.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.180
It's out.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.180
It's out.

18:57.180 --> 18:58.180
It's out.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.180
It's out.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.780
All day, Julie's been at me, non-stop.

19:01.820 --> 19:04.660
I've come on this experience to try new things,

19:04.700 --> 19:06.340
to push my comfort zones.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.780
Hello?

19:09.860 --> 19:11.380
Guys?

19:11.420 --> 19:13.140
Can someone shine their light over here?

19:13.180 --> 19:15.140
Cos I swear I'm hearing noises.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.340
Please, it's like a...

19:17.380 --> 19:19.220
Is someone moving?

19:19.260 --> 19:21.820
It's coming close to me, please!

19:21.860 --> 19:23.220
It's Julie!

19:23.260 --> 19:25.020
Oh, fuck my life.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.220
Oh, shit.

19:27.220 --> 19:30.540
On Coconut Beach, the storm is still in the distance,

19:30.580 --> 19:33.420
and the dehydrated women are pinning all their hopes

19:33.460 --> 19:36.140
on their makeshift containers collecting rain.

19:36.180 --> 19:39.020
I've never actually wanted water so much in my life.

19:39.060 --> 19:41.660
Check this lightning out behind me.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.700
Yes!

19:44.820 --> 19:46.820
It's so cool.

19:46.860 --> 19:50.180
I don't know if you can actually see the line of lightning.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.980
Look, I feel like a weather girl.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.020
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.100
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.100
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.100
And here we have...

20:01.140 --> 20:03.100
a big, fuck-off, shiny storm.

20:05.140 --> 20:08.140
And to the north, we have a storm.

20:08.180 --> 20:11.140
And just there, we've got a bolt of lightning.

20:14.140 --> 20:17.140
And I imagine around here, in just a moment,

20:17.180 --> 20:19.140
we're going to have a bolt of lightning.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.220
And I imagine just about there,

20:23.260 --> 20:25.220
we're going to have a bolt of lightning.

20:25.260 --> 20:26.500
To the right.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
It's from cloud to cloud.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.420
In a moment, we're going to have a strong north-easterly bolt of lightning.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.460
Right there.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.100
Hang on, we're having a few technical difficulties.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.140
Thank you, Bob.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.260
11pm. With the storm still a way off,

20:51.300 --> 20:55.540
the women bed down for a long night under their makeshift shelter.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.380
I can see the rain on this side.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.740
All lights off.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.580
Nighty night.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.260
Bloody hell, have you farted in my face again?

21:09.300 --> 21:11.140
Sorry, I did.

21:21.660 --> 21:26.180
It's 5.30am and the storm has finally hit the island.

21:26.180 --> 21:29.380
The women are hoping their containers are full of rainwater.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.860
We've just had the most uncomfortable sleep of our lives.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.040
It's just a nightmare.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.780
I just hope we can get some water in as soon.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.840
Can I just share something with you, everybody?

21:44.660 --> 21:46.980
Really bad news, we have no water

21:46.980 --> 21:49.160
because the tide has washed our bottles away.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.320
Nothing.

21:50.660 --> 21:50.940
Fuck.

21:51.220 --> 21:51.560
Fuck.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.860
Oh, fuck.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.980
I feel like I could cry right now.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.900
I seriously think I could cry.

21:57.820 --> 21:59.040
I think I need a little shit.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.740
After almost 48 hours with hardly anything to drink,

22:04.120 --> 22:06.540
the women sourced just a handful of coconuts.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.980
Oh, my God, this one's cold!

22:10.240 --> 22:10.800
Ah!

22:12.580 --> 22:15.700
But with only enough liquid to have a few sips each,

22:16.020 --> 22:18.160
one woman is finding it all too much.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.220
You all right, Kate?

22:20.820 --> 22:21.620
Just struggling.

22:24.980 --> 22:26.900
I'm really struggling, guys.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.460
Come on, come on, come on.

22:28.460 --> 22:29.460
Give some love.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
I'm really, really missing my girl.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.420
I've decided to do this because, having been made redundant four times,

22:38.420 --> 22:43.380
it left me feeling worthless and a burden on everybody.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.460
And I wanted to set myself a challenge

22:46.460 --> 22:48.620
and do something that was extremely difficult,

22:48.620 --> 22:51.740
but that I had to do, and that I can't walk away from it.

22:51.740 --> 22:54.820
I have more confidence in myself.

22:54.980 --> 22:57.020
I make my children proud of me.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.620
I make my husband, Chris, proud of me.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.700
I just feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.740
No, not at all.

23:03.740 --> 23:05.500
I'm with God, you are doing brilliant.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.740
You are doing absolutely brilliant,

23:06.740 --> 23:08.740
and they're going to be so proud of you.

23:08.740 --> 23:09.740
I know.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.740
I just want to speak to Chris.

23:11.740 --> 23:12.340
I know.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.540
And have him say, keep going.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.340
You can't do everything through your kids and your husband.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.300
You have to have some me time.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.540
But I like doing everything through them.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.540
OK, well, that's cool.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.220
I think initially, when people get marooned,

23:24.220 --> 23:24.860
it's all about the fun.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.660
The physical, the fact that they're tired,

23:26.660 --> 23:28.660
and they're hungry, and they're hurting.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.300
But after a while, people become accustomed to that.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.380
But then the battle becomes something much more meaningful.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.620
Actually, the fact that you're missing your loved ones.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.500
And those battles can be much harder.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.340
I'm so thirsty.

23:44.340 --> 23:49.780
I haven't managed to find any water.

23:49.780 --> 23:51.500
I'm so thirsty.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.500
Look at that.

23:54.860 --> 24:01.780
The good news for the women is that in tropical storm season,

24:01.780 --> 24:05.540
the weather can change in an instant.

24:05.540 --> 24:09.540
Guys, guys, bring your pots.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.460
It's running like a bloody tap.

24:11.460 --> 24:14.340
The return of the rain proves to be their salvation.

24:14.340 --> 24:15.340
Yes.

24:15.340 --> 24:16.340
Woo-hoo.

24:16.340 --> 24:17.340
Yes.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.340
First in the jungle.

24:18.340 --> 24:19.340
Ah.

24:19.340 --> 24:22.340
Watch my mouth, they think.

24:22.340 --> 24:23.340
Oh, my god.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.340
Oh, my god.

24:24.340 --> 24:25.340
This is amazing.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.340
Wow.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.340
Cheers.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.340
Cheers.

24:28.340 --> 24:29.340
Oh, my god.

24:29.340 --> 24:30.340
That is just the best feeling.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.340
Yeah, baby.

24:31.340 --> 24:32.340
From the most miserable situation to the most joyous situation.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.340
Yeah, see?

24:33.340 --> 24:34.340
We go up, we go down, we go up, we go down.

24:34.340 --> 24:52.620
We were right through the floor down, and now we're elated.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
Rehydrated.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.620
Time to dive.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.620
And with bottles full of water.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.620
And we came down this one.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.620
The expedition party set off.

24:57.620 --> 24:58.620
Confident they'll finally rescue the others.

24:58.620 --> 24:59.620
Okay, so we're on the right track.

24:59.620 --> 25:00.620
In the jungle.

25:00.620 --> 25:01.620
The mighty jungle.

25:01.620 --> 25:02.620
The lion sneaks tonight.

25:02.620 --> 25:03.620
Go.

25:03.620 --> 25:04.620
A-wimboing.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.620
A-wimboing.

25:05.620 --> 25:06.620
A-wimboing.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.620
A-wimboing.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.620
A-wimboing.

25:08.620 --> 25:09.620
A-wimboing.

25:09.620 --> 25:10.620
A-wimboing.

25:10.620 --> 25:11.620
A-wimboing.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.620
A-wimboing.

25:12.620 --> 25:13.620
A-wimboing.

25:13.620 --> 25:14.620
A-wimboing.

25:14.620 --> 25:15.620
A-wimboing.

25:15.620 --> 25:16.620
A-wimboing.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.620
A-wimboing.

25:17.620 --> 25:18.620
A-wimboing.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.620
A-wimboing.

25:19.620 --> 25:20.620
A-wimboing.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.620
A-wimboing.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.620
A-wimboing.

25:22.620 --> 25:23.620
A-wimboing.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.860
It's the women's fifth day on the island.

25:34.860 --> 25:39.620
And the two groups have been separated for over two days.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.620
Spirits are buoyed with bottles full of rain water,

25:42.620 --> 25:46.100
but the expedition party are going round in circles,

25:46.100 --> 25:47.940
trying to return to camp

25:47.940 --> 25:49.940
to rescue the women waiting.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.940
We want to stay in a straight line.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.940
Nobody's disagreeing with you.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.940
We will have to make little diversions.

25:57.940 --> 25:59.940
No, that way.

25:59.940 --> 26:02.940
Mum of two, Kate, remains desperately homesick,

26:02.940 --> 26:04.940
missing her family.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.940
Just doing my head in.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.940
Because I'm not doing another night in this jungle like this.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.940
That will be it for me, and I've made that decision.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.940
If we don't make it back... You feel that strongly about it now?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.940
Yep, and I know the people who matter to me the most

26:15.940 --> 26:18.940
won't care if I come home early, to be honest.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.940
Kate, calm down. We're going the right direction.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.940
It might not be... I'm not talking to you.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.940
..like a path. I'm talking to George.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.940
I know. Fucking attitude and a half, you do.

26:29.940 --> 26:31.940
And you can kiss my fucking arse.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.940
If these women are going to survive, they've got to learn quickly

26:36.940 --> 26:38.940
how to work together as a team.

26:39.940 --> 26:42.940
Pulling together is paramount in times of crisis,

26:42.940 --> 26:44.940
and the truth is we always survive better

26:44.940 --> 26:45.940
when we're together.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.940
When we cooperate and when we don't fight.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.940
Um, there's only... Please, no negativity.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
We just need to keep on this positively.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.940
I know you've got a really bad attitude, Kate.

26:56.940 --> 26:58.940
I haven't. I'm just fed up.

26:58.940 --> 27:01.940
You're speaking to everyone with a really bad tone,

27:01.940 --> 27:04.940
so can everybody please stop arguing?

27:04.940 --> 27:06.940
Because it's really not helping.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.940
But maybe we should just, for the next ten minutes,

27:08.940 --> 27:10.940
all of us just say completely nothing

27:10.940 --> 27:12.940
and just concentrate on walking and following Fee.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.940
No, that way.

27:18.940 --> 27:20.940
Guys, I think we need to go that way.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.940
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:22.940 --> 27:24.940
Silence.

27:24.940 --> 27:27.940
I'm asking a few group of women to keep silent.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.940
We lasted literally ten...

27:29.940 --> 27:32.940
Everyone, good idea. Ten seconds.

27:37.940 --> 27:41.940
At camp, the group have spent over two days with no food,

27:41.940 --> 27:44.940
drinking just small amounts of rainwater,

27:44.940 --> 27:47.940
waiting for the expedition party to return.

27:47.940 --> 27:51.940
And damp conditions have brought out the jungle critters.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.940
Like, right now, all my arse is proper itchy.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.940
It's only got a few bites, but above it, my face, my hands...

27:58.940 --> 28:00.940
Shiaz, we've just looked at her arse.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.940
Oh, yeah, we have just looked at her bum.

28:03.940 --> 28:06.940
The rain last night was ridiculous.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.940
Like, I was just...

28:08.940 --> 28:11.940
I'm so ill that I just need to sleep.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.940
Like, my throat, I can't swallow.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.940
I don't know how to do this.

28:15.940 --> 28:19.940
I want to show everyone I can do this, but it's really hard.

28:21.940 --> 28:24.940
Whenever I have a problem, my parents always help me out.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.940
Right now, my dad pays for everything that I want.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.940
My boyfriend looks after me, especially on nights out.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.940
They see me as their baby that they still need to protect.

28:33.940 --> 28:37.940
I don't do anything by myself, and I want to be more independent.

28:37.940 --> 28:39.940
I want to do something for myself

28:39.940 --> 28:42.940
and just be able to be like, yes, I did that.

28:43.940 --> 28:48.940
The worst part is I'm starting to think that my parents were right.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.940
I shouldn't have done this.

28:54.940 --> 28:57.940
Back in the jungle, Forrester's daughter, Fi,

28:57.940 --> 29:00.940
has taken over leadership of the trek back to camp.

29:00.940 --> 29:04.940
But it's only taken half an hour for the mood to disintegrate.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.940
We really strongly think we need to go right here.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.940
I've got to say, I do agree.

29:09.940 --> 29:10.940
Oh, brilliant.

29:10.940 --> 29:11.940
We have been travelling in the past,

29:11.940 --> 29:14.940
we have been travelling in this direction.

29:14.940 --> 29:15.940
No, we haven't.

29:15.940 --> 29:17.940
We've been travelling in that direction.

29:17.940 --> 29:18.940
No.

29:18.940 --> 29:19.940
Yeah.

29:19.940 --> 29:20.940
No.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.940
Why is it you're so adamant you're right all the time?

29:23.940 --> 29:24.940
Just hold on.

29:24.940 --> 29:26.940
I'm not adamant I'm right all the time.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.940
Yes, you are, because you're dismissing everybody else.

29:29.940 --> 29:30.940
Listen, I understand.

29:30.940 --> 29:31.940
Fi will not listen.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.940
Jeez, I live in the woods, so I always circumnavigate woods.

29:34.940 --> 29:35.940
Well done.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.940
But we spent the night last night in a place that we had just left.

29:39.940 --> 29:40.940
You never noticed... That was my fault.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
..that we'd double back on us.

29:41.940 --> 29:42.940
That was my fault.

29:42.940 --> 29:43.940
We never noticed we'd double back.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.940
Because she wasn't in charge.

29:44.940 --> 29:48.940
It's often when stress levels are high that all the social graces fall away,

29:48.940 --> 29:50.940
and it's also when tempers fray.

29:50.940 --> 29:54.940
They've got to learn quickly how to communicate better as a team.

29:54.940 --> 29:59.940
At this point, their survival and that of the women at camp depends on it.

29:59.940 --> 30:01.940
We have to spend another night in this jungle like this.

30:01.940 --> 30:02.940
I'm out of here.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.940
You need to listen to people.

30:04.940 --> 30:05.940
You don't listen to anybody.

30:05.940 --> 30:09.940
I do think that you really don't listen to anybody.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.940
And this is actually... Is this life or death?

30:12.940 --> 30:16.940
I'm just so tempted to tell you to take the lead and do it.

30:16.940 --> 30:21.940
Yeah, cos then if I leave, it's my own fault, because I'd have got us lost.

30:21.940 --> 30:22.940
And give up.

30:22.940 --> 30:24.940
OK, I have the machete.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.940
Oh, my God! What?

30:30.940 --> 30:33.940
Help! Becky!

30:33.940 --> 30:34.940
Becky!

30:34.940 --> 30:37.940
I'm coming!

30:37.940 --> 30:38.940
Call the medics!

30:39.940 --> 30:40.940
She's gone!

30:40.940 --> 30:42.940
Bran! Bran's fainted!

30:42.940 --> 30:45.940
Radio in, medic, now!

30:45.940 --> 30:47.940
She's absolutely fucking boiling.

30:47.940 --> 30:48.940
Oh, my God!

30:48.940 --> 30:51.940
With Belinda, the only doctor amongst her 13 women,

30:51.940 --> 30:53.940
lost with the expedition party,

30:53.940 --> 30:58.940
the group at camp must radio for a safety response team to intervene.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.940
Doctor Bravo, do you copy?

31:00.940 --> 31:01.940
We see you missing, girl.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.940
Bran, passed out.

31:03.940 --> 31:07.940
They are on standby on a nearby island in case of emergency.

31:07.940 --> 31:08.940
Erm...

31:08.940 --> 31:10.940
She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.

31:10.940 --> 31:11.940
Oh, my God!

31:11.940 --> 31:13.940
This is way fucking beyond any fucking joke.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.940
Everyone needs off here, I swear to God.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.940
It's not a programme. It's fucking ridiculous.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.940
Having gone to the rocks for air,

31:21.940 --> 31:24.940
after five days with barely any food or water,

31:24.940 --> 31:27.940
Fran has taken a serious turn for the worse.

31:31.940 --> 31:34.940
The safety response team arrive.

31:34.940 --> 31:36.940
Hello, Fran.

31:36.940 --> 31:41.940
We're just dealing with a flat, squirrely cause at that location.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.940
I think the problem is with Fran.

31:43.940 --> 31:44.940
I think she's not a moaner.

31:44.940 --> 31:46.940
I think she's been far iller than we knew.

31:51.940 --> 31:53.940
We're going to put her on a stretcher,

31:53.940 --> 31:55.940
we're going to take her on our boat,

31:55.940 --> 31:57.940
and then we're going to do proper assessment

31:57.940 --> 31:59.940
and see what needs to happen from there.

32:02.940 --> 32:04.940
With the group at camp a member down

32:04.940 --> 32:08.940
and the expedition party lost with dwindling water supplies,

32:08.940 --> 32:11.940
the women's existence on the island hangs in the balance.

32:13.940 --> 32:14.940
Look at that.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.940
We need a radio in, medic, now.

32:25.940 --> 32:29.940
The 13 women have been split apart for two days.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.940
She's collapsed. Oh, my God!

32:32.940 --> 32:33.940
And the group at camp

32:33.940 --> 32:36.940
are now a member down after Fran collapsed

32:36.940 --> 32:38.940
and was evacuated from the island.

32:39.940 --> 32:41.940
Another one gone?

32:41.940 --> 32:44.940
I knew she was poorlier than we thought.

32:44.940 --> 32:46.940
Out at sea, my safety response team

32:46.940 --> 32:49.940
are assessing 24-year-old Fran.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.940
It says 72 and 146.

32:53.940 --> 32:57.940
I don't care how, like, dehydrated or faint I am,

32:57.940 --> 32:59.940
the rest of us are exactly the same.

32:59.940 --> 33:01.940
I shouldn't get any privileged treatment

33:01.940 --> 33:02.940
over feeling a bit sick.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.940
I'm just really pissed off at myself.

33:04.940 --> 33:06.940
I know I can do this.

33:06.940 --> 33:10.940
Till I faint 400 times, you're not allowed to take me off that thing.

33:10.940 --> 33:14.940
After five days without anywhere near enough water,

33:14.940 --> 33:17.940
Fran has succumbed to dehydration.

33:17.940 --> 33:20.940
And with the expedition party still nowhere in sight,

33:20.940 --> 33:23.940
the other four women are equally at risk.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.940
What the hell?

33:25.940 --> 33:28.940
There's so many people dropping off.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.940
I'm just worried there's going to be more and more.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.940
Because people can't stand these conditions.

33:35.940 --> 33:38.940
Fran's coming back. Fran's coming back.

33:38.940 --> 33:39.940
Is she really?

33:42.940 --> 33:46.940
Fran's body temperature and heart rate have returned to normal.

33:46.940 --> 33:48.940
And in Dr Belinda's absence,

33:48.940 --> 33:52.940
the safety response team deem her fit enough to rejoin the others.

33:52.940 --> 33:55.940
Is it like heaven, seeing us?

33:55.940 --> 33:56.940
Oh, I'm sure.

33:56.940 --> 33:59.940
I'm sure there's things she'd rather see than us.

33:59.940 --> 34:00.940
I had to beg her.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.940
I had to beg them to let me back on the island.

34:04.940 --> 34:06.940
I just had to come back, though,

34:06.940 --> 34:08.940
cos, like, then it would be only four girls here

34:08.940 --> 34:11.940
and I couldn't leave them.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.940
I'm so glad I'm back.

34:15.940 --> 34:18.940
The expedition party have been walking for two days,

34:18.940 --> 34:21.940
trying to find their way back to camp.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.940
This is where I feel we should go.

34:23.940 --> 34:25.940
This looks like a pretty good path.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.940
Having wrestled leadership of the group,

34:27.940 --> 34:29.940
homesick mum of two, Kate,

34:29.940 --> 34:32.940
is now guiding the women through the jungle.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.940
This is going to go well.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.940
Just keep going.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.940
This is where you want to go.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.940
The thought of not getting there, stressing me out, you know?

34:41.940 --> 34:42.940
We will get there.

34:42.940 --> 34:45.940
I'm not confident to take responsibility for this.

34:45.940 --> 34:47.940
OK, well, where are we going now?

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
Where are we going now?

34:48.940 --> 34:50.940
Just keep going straight. No more confrontational arguing.

34:50.940 --> 34:51.940
Just keep walking.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.940
It's just that way. Keep going, keep going, keep going.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.940
Well, I'm losing my confidence now.

34:55.940 --> 34:56.940
I don't want to lead.

34:56.940 --> 34:57.940
I'm sorry, I don't want to lead this group.

34:57.940 --> 34:58.940
I don't want to.

34:58.940 --> 35:00.940
I'll lead it. You tell me where to go.

35:00.940 --> 35:01.940
Or do you know what?

35:01.940 --> 35:02.940
Or you lead. What do you think?

35:02.940 --> 35:04.940
And I'm just saying a word. No, no, no.

35:04.940 --> 35:05.940
No, I'm not going to say another word

35:05.940 --> 35:07.940
because I'm having a complete crisis of confidence in myself.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.940
I'm so scared.

35:09.940 --> 35:10.940
We're all scared.

35:10.940 --> 35:11.940
Because you were so confident.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.940
Yeah, but that's... I know, but...

35:13.940 --> 35:15.940
Now it's gone.

35:15.940 --> 35:16.940
My confidence is gone.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.940
Sorry, I should just keep my mouth shut.

35:18.940 --> 35:19.940
You lead the way, Faye, please.

35:19.940 --> 35:20.940
Fuck!

35:28.940 --> 35:32.940
After over two days of waiting and now dangerously dehydrated,

35:32.940 --> 35:37.940
the women at camp are finally taking their fate into their own hands.

35:37.940 --> 35:41.940
They haven't found us, so we've got no alternative but to find them.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.940
Because we've stayed and we've waited, I don't even know,

35:43.940 --> 35:46.940
two days, three days, to be rescued.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.940
If we don't find them,

35:48.940 --> 35:51.940
I think we're going to make a raft and go to another island.

35:51.940 --> 35:56.940
I just never, ever want to see this spot ever in my life again.

35:56.940 --> 35:57.940
Until now, staying put.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.940
Staying put has actually been the surest way

36:00.940 --> 36:02.940
of allowing the others to try and find them.

36:02.940 --> 36:06.940
But after days with no fire, dwindling water supplies, no food,

36:06.940 --> 36:10.940
the women now need to weigh out the dangers of striking out into the unknown

36:10.940 --> 36:14.940
against the risk of waiting it out with no more resources.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.940
Now we have to just go and blow our whistles madly

36:17.940 --> 36:19.940
to see if anyone's hearing us, and that's what we're going to do.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.940
That's the plan. Blow, blow, blow.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.940
Everybody in this group is good at blowing, yeah?

36:25.940 --> 36:26.940
Yeah?

36:26.940 --> 36:27.940
I think we're all...

36:27.940 --> 36:29.940
We're the reason blowers here.

36:29.940 --> 36:30.940
Yeah, girls?

36:30.940 --> 36:31.940
Yes.

36:33.940 --> 36:36.940
Unaware of the expedition party's whereabouts,

36:36.940 --> 36:39.940
the five women are searching the coastline.

36:40.940 --> 36:44.940
Our journey to find the other team begins now.

36:45.940 --> 36:46.940
Whoa.

36:47.940 --> 36:48.940
Are you all right, sweetheart?

36:48.940 --> 36:49.940
Yeah, sorry.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.940
Cracking on.

36:50.940 --> 36:51.940
Good on you.

36:51.940 --> 36:52.940
Oh, it's so cold.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.940
Oh, my gosh, my knickers are getting wet.

36:54.940 --> 36:55.940
Oh, my God.

36:55.940 --> 36:56.940
At least our fannies will feel fresher.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.940
Yeah.

36:58.940 --> 37:02.940
Having left Coconut Beach three hours ago,

37:02.940 --> 37:05.940
the expedition party are completely lost

37:05.940 --> 37:08.940
and their water supply is fast disappearing.

37:08.940 --> 37:11.940
After homesick mum of two, Kate, quit as leader,

37:11.940 --> 37:13.940
Georgie recognises where they are.

37:15.940 --> 37:16.940
Oh, my God.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.940
I made these, Mark.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.940
I knew I recognised this place.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.940
The women are convinced they are finally about to find camp.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.940
Do you remember you, me and Abi did a recce?

37:28.940 --> 37:30.940
This is where we came to.

37:30.940 --> 37:31.940
I know.

37:31.940 --> 37:32.940
I know.

37:32.940 --> 37:33.940
That's what I was just saying.

37:33.940 --> 37:34.940
They're just down there.

37:38.940 --> 37:42.940
I'm ecstatic just because I got the hell out of Shit Creek.

37:42.940 --> 37:44.940
Fuck, that's so fucking deep.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.940
That's up to my tits, so that's swimming for Fran.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.940
It feels desperate because we feel so close right now.

37:52.940 --> 37:53.940
No!

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
Yeah.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.940
We haven't had a response on the signal.

38:04.940 --> 38:05.940
I'm coming out.

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
Along the coast,

38:06.940 --> 38:09.940
the group from camp have entered the mangrove swamps.

38:11.940 --> 38:12.940
Are we?

38:13.940 --> 38:14.940
OK. OK.

38:14.940 --> 38:15.940
I can't do this.

38:15.940 --> 38:16.940
I've got you. I've got you.

38:16.940 --> 38:18.940
You can totally do this.

38:18.940 --> 38:19.940
One, two, three.

38:21.940 --> 38:22.940
There we go.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.940
With the sweltering midday sun beating down on us,

38:24.940 --> 38:25.940
the dehydrated women,

38:25.940 --> 38:28.940
55-year-old cashier Julie is struggling.

38:28.940 --> 38:29.940
Oh, fuck.

38:29.940 --> 38:30.940
It's all right, hold me.

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
Back one's in now.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.940
Left and right, left and right.

38:32.940 --> 38:33.940
There.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.940
That's it.

38:35.940 --> 38:36.940
OK, so feet...

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
I need to leave me boots.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.940
No, you're going to need to take those with you.

38:39.940 --> 38:40.940
You're going to need them.

38:40.940 --> 38:41.940
So we can do it.

38:41.940 --> 38:42.940
We'll just take our time.

38:43.940 --> 38:44.940
No rush.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.940
We'll just take our time.

38:48.940 --> 38:49.940
Oh, friggin' hell.

38:50.940 --> 38:51.940
Oh, fuck.

38:51.940 --> 38:53.940
Oh, friggin' hell.

38:53.940 --> 38:54.940
Oh, God.

38:54.940 --> 38:55.940
Right?

38:55.940 --> 38:56.940
Yeah, thanks.

39:01.940 --> 39:02.940
Another mark.

39:02.940 --> 39:03.940
Look, another one.

39:04.940 --> 39:05.940
Snap.

39:05.940 --> 39:06.940
Yeah, brilliant.

39:09.940 --> 39:10.940
Yeah, this is it.

39:10.940 --> 39:11.940
This is good.

39:11.940 --> 39:12.940
I recognise this.

39:14.940 --> 39:16.940
We're so damn close, though.

39:16.940 --> 39:17.940
So close.

39:17.940 --> 39:18.940
This does look familiar.

39:18.940 --> 39:22.940
We're literally round this corner.

39:22.940 --> 39:24.940
Is that a pink potty down there?

39:24.940 --> 39:25.940
Yes.

39:25.940 --> 39:26.940
So you recognise it?

39:27.940 --> 39:29.940
We're at Coconut fucking Beach.

39:29.940 --> 39:30.940
No, we're not.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.940
Yeah, we're at Coconut Beach.

39:33.940 --> 39:34.940
We are.

39:34.940 --> 39:35.940
You're right, we are.

39:35.940 --> 39:36.940
What the fuck?

39:38.940 --> 39:40.940
Come on, let's get down there.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.940
I can't fucking deal with this.

39:44.940 --> 39:46.940
The women have circled back to Coconut Beach

39:46.940 --> 39:47.940
for a second time.

39:47.940 --> 39:50.940
Having pushed through the jungle for two days,

39:50.940 --> 39:53.940
they're not one step closer to camp.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.940
How the fuck is that possible?

39:58.940 --> 39:59.940
How is this possible?

39:59.940 --> 40:02.940
We kept the sea to our left the whole time.

40:03.940 --> 40:05.940
After conquering the mangroves,

40:05.940 --> 40:08.940
the group from camp continue north.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.940
Guys, it's a beach!

40:12.940 --> 40:13.940
Woo!

40:14.940 --> 40:15.940
I can't believe we're here.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.940
Becky, this is what I've been dreaming of.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.940
After five days being trapped in the jungle,

40:23.940 --> 40:26.940
they remain determined to find the expedition party.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.940
I thought we were so fucking close,

40:30.940 --> 40:32.940
like, three minutes away.

40:32.940 --> 40:35.940
It's only round the corner, but we can't fucking navigate.

40:35.940 --> 40:37.940
We cannot navigate through that.

40:37.940 --> 40:40.940
I'm stressed because I thought we were so close.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.940
And then I can't walk and I'm just fucked

40:43.940 --> 40:44.940
and we're all fucked.

40:45.940 --> 40:46.940
It sucks.

40:55.940 --> 40:58.940
Three nights without water,

40:58.940 --> 41:00.940
fucking trousers like this.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.940
I can't do it. No way.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.940
I was wanting to see them and see if they were OK.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.940
How the fuck did that happen?

41:10.940 --> 41:12.940
I don't even understand.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.940
We cannot walk anywhere on this island

41:14.940 --> 41:15.940
and we're getting lost.

41:19.940 --> 41:20.940
It's a maze.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.940
It's the world's trickiest maze.

41:28.940 --> 41:31.940
Shall we have a 30-second shade break?

41:31.940 --> 41:32.940
No.

41:32.940 --> 41:34.940
I need to go and see.

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
OK.

41:44.940 --> 41:47.940
Another beach, but not as nice as the one we're on.

41:48.940 --> 41:49.940
Hang on.

41:49.940 --> 41:52.940
Is that a load of clothes hanging in that tree?

41:53.940 --> 41:55.940
Hello!

42:00.940 --> 42:02.940
What? I can hear someone.

42:02.940 --> 42:05.940
I'll be back to pick you up.

42:06.940 --> 42:19.280
This is the 35thвер fact of all the

42:20.940 --> 42:22.940
Yeah.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.940
I think I've got to pick it up.

42:24.940 --> 42:25.940
Oh!

42:27.940 --> 42:28.940
Woo!

42:28.940 --> 42:29.940
Woo!

42:29.940 --> 42:49.440
How ever bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity, you know, survival is

42:49.440 --> 42:54.500
about dogged determination, learning from your failures and never giving up.

42:54.500 --> 43:18.100
Finally, back together, the women take a moment to savour their island home.

43:18.100 --> 43:23.280
We needed them, we've all got different strengths and weaknesses that help, it's just kind of

43:23.280 --> 43:24.280
complete.

43:24.280 --> 43:43.020
By evening, with the reunited group, 13 women strong, it's all hands on deck to light a

43:43.020 --> 43:46.600
new fire.

43:46.600 --> 43:52.060
But after being lost for two days, island survival has taken its toll on mum of two,

43:52.060 --> 43:53.060
Kate.

43:53.060 --> 43:54.060
It's just a dream.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.060
It's just the whole end.

43:55.060 --> 43:56.060
The blunt end.

43:56.060 --> 44:01.060
If I'm really honest with you, I can't see it getting any better.

44:01.060 --> 44:06.060
I feel really tired and very, very emotional.

44:06.060 --> 44:12.060
To try and be a part of this group, but they're not the people I need to be with.

44:12.060 --> 44:18.720
I need to be with my family.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.820
And I just need to be at home.

44:20.820 --> 44:22.060
The general feeling is, I'm not going to be home.

44:22.060 --> 44:23.060
I'm going to be home.

44:23.060 --> 44:24.060
I'm going to be home.

44:24.060 --> 44:25.060
Take me home, please.

44:25.060 --> 44:26.060
Take me home, please.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.060
By morning, furniture maker Kate has made her decision.

44:27.060 --> 44:28.060
I'm not going home because I'm dehydrated.

44:28.060 --> 44:29.060
I'm not going home because I can't pack it.

44:29.060 --> 44:34.060
I'm going home because I want to be at home.

44:34.060 --> 44:36.060
You contribute so much.

44:36.060 --> 44:39.060
You really do.

44:39.060 --> 44:43.060
But it's been difficult for me because I've been missing people so much.

44:43.060 --> 44:52.060
That won't be possible with any help.

44:52.060 --> 44:55.260
You've been missing people so much. That won't get any easier.

44:55.300 --> 44:56.660
That'll get worse.

44:58.460 --> 45:01.460
Oh, my God, it's horrible seeing another one go.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.220
I thought she'd hang on in there.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.660
We need everybody, and she had good knowledge

45:05.700 --> 45:07.900
of bloody building and stuff.

45:10.180 --> 45:12.460
Mum was fucking pissed off.

45:13.740 --> 45:17.620
I just think it's weak of her to do that.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.540
She's giving up too easily.

45:19.580 --> 45:21.900
We need each other to boost each other up.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.900
But it's the old thing, isn't it?

45:23.940 --> 45:26.580
Kids, mum and her kids.

45:26.620 --> 45:29.020
It's the old pull.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.300
Men can do it, but a lot of women can't.

45:33.180 --> 45:35.380
After barely a week on the island,

45:35.420 --> 45:37.820
a second member of the team has quit.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.420
And with power in numbers,

45:41.460 --> 45:44.540
the women's ability to survive is diminishing.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.820
I'm a bit pissed off.

45:49.860 --> 45:51.060
I think it's a great shame,

45:51.100 --> 45:51.860
because the hit was a great one.

45:51.940 --> 45:55.980
It was a fantastic experiment to see how 14 women could cope

45:56.020 --> 45:57.580
in this situation.

45:57.620 --> 45:58.820
And two of them have gone already,

45:58.860 --> 46:01.420
and I don't think that shows us all in particularly good light.

46:08.580 --> 46:10.060
Next time on the island...

46:10.100 --> 46:13.020
Sometimes out here can feel like you've been hit

46:13.060 --> 46:15.100
by a major disaster.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.780
So thin now.

46:16.820 --> 46:18.660
All sorts of bones appearing

46:18.700 --> 46:21.220
that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.

46:21.220 --> 46:24.140
We need to find a solid source of food

46:24.180 --> 46:25.940
or we could be facing meltdown.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.300
Every fucker's bitching and moaning

46:27.340 --> 46:29.340
that you're doing fuck all when it comes to water.

46:29.380 --> 46:33.380
I'd say we're 95% sure we've got a caiman in our second trap.

46:33.420 --> 46:34.540
Holy fuck.

46:34.580 --> 46:36.340
Come on, baby.

46:36.380 --> 46:37.620
Sam, get out of the water, mate.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.180
Watch him, watch him. Go now, go now.
