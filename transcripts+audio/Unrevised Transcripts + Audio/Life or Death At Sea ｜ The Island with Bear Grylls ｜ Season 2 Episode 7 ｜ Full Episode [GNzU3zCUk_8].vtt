00:00.000 --> 00:14.720
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.720 --> 00:23.400
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

00:23.400 --> 00:28.760
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools

00:30.000 --> 00:37.560
filming everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power

00:37.560 --> 00:51.500
for your boys or mental strength the Windsor day oh my god oh my god who will have what it

00:51.500 --> 00:55.900
takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men's island

00:55.900 --> 00:59.920
you're on

01:00.000 --> 01:13.200
like actually could have died survival will be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height

01:13.200 --> 01:18.840
and harsh tropical storm season everyone's aware everyone's cold everyone's miserable everyone's

01:18.840 --> 01:26.120
tired they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food what the effing hell is

01:26.120 --> 01:29.820
that have these modern-day men got what it takes to survive and survive and survive and survive and

01:29.820 --> 01:29.980
survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive

01:30.000 --> 01:32.920
and survive and survive and survive and survive and survive you are three and a half hour making

01:32.920 --> 01:32.940
you are three and a half hour making

01:32.940 --> 01:34.880
you are three and a half hour making soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell

01:34.880 --> 01:34.900
soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell

01:34.900 --> 01:36.960
soap could be done in 25 minutes you tell any Chef that cooking for 11 people is

01:36.960 --> 01:37.000
any Chef that cooking for 11 people is

01:37.000 --> 01:42.460
any Chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy and your stabbing

01:44.900 --> 01:54.620
three weeks ago fourteen British men

01:54.620 --> 01:54.640
three weeks ago fourteen British men

01:54.640 --> 01:56.920
three weeks ago fourteen British men were cast away on this remote Pacific

01:56.920 --> 01:56.940
were cast away on this remote Pacific

01:56.940 --> 01:59.840
were cast away on this remote Pacific Island

01:59.840 --> 01:59.900
Pacific Island

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Living on the edge of existence...

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
OK, Vic, go now, go now. Right, that's it.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
..until 47-year-old Vic...

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Here we go, puppy dogs!

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
..led them to capture and kill...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Bullshit!

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
..the island's number-one predator.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
We've just caught a prehistoric animal!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
But despite their best efforts,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
they've not been able to repeat the success.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Truck empty.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
The onset of starvation looks upon us.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
And feast has turned to famine.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Hey, look, you can see Piers's heart beating through his chest.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Boys, there's no meat on you.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I think we're going to run into some really hard times

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
in the next couple of weeks, and we'll see.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It'll test everybody's mettle, mine as much as anybody else.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Guys, there's a snake here.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Keep track of it, we're coming.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
OK, Bonnie.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Knock it off.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, my gosh.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Bonnie, you've become a killer.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
It's food, but I take no pleasure from doing that whatsoever.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
It's the second bloody animal I've ever headed since being here.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Killer.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
In the four days since the men caught and ate the crocodile,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
they've had to survive on slim pickings.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, hello.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's eaten... It's a little bird or something.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
..a baby bird!

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Look at that.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
A bird and a snake.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Get him on the fire too.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, man.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
He's been there.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's like snake crisps.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
It's very, like, pork-scratching.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, man, guilt.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Apart from the odd, opportunistic kill,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
the only man who's been able to provide anything

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
like a regular supply of food for the group is 47-year-old Vic.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Woo!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Hoo!

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Look at the size of that bitch!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Woo!

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
If I didn't have another mouse to feed, I would live like a king.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
There's no two ways about that.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
It's a shame nobody else is raking food in,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
cos that would be helpful.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
If he wants to go out and catch amazing fish

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and keeps me fed every night, I'm not going to stop the guy.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But even with Vic's contributions,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
the men are burning far more calories than they're consuming.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm slowly evaporating.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Soon to disappear down the plughole.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
What happens in these periods of starvation

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
is that the body starts to eat into its own fat reserves

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
and key muscle groups, like your legs,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
that you desperately need in a survival situation.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
And then, over time, as the brain also gets starved of nutrients,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
that decline becomes mental as well as physical,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
and that then affects your ability to make smart,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
rational decisions.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, that's new, that's fresh.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
This is dry as a bone, this stuff.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
We got it? Got it.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Got it.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Every day, the men face a round of essential back-breaking chores.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I feel pretty tired.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Which leave them little time or energy for hunting.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
With no food to sustain them,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
the group's cook, Sam Brown,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
is doing his best to feed the fish.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
He's doing his best to rustle up an edible lunch

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
from leftover fish bits, crocodile bones and limpets.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Put the stew on, we're boiling the bones down,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
we're going to save the big bones so we can make a stock.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm trying to feed 11 people in the next hour or two hours.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
A lot of the cooking has fallen on my shoulders.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I'd rather do it and do it well

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
than watch someone else it up and go hungry

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
or I have to pick fish scales out of my food.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, for f***'s sake, guys.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
What?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
F***ing filled with limpet guts.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
We've got 11 bowls, three of which have been used as spittoons.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
That's overnight rotting limpet guts.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That's disgusting and that's going to give us diarrhea,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
vomiting, that's going to get you off the island really fast.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Somebody needs to be on washing up detail.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
We'll wash all them? Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
They don't wash themselves, boys.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I think what you just said, they're a little bit unfair there, Sam.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'll talk to them when we get back. No, no, why didn't you do it?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Do what? Why didn't you take them down and wash them?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Cos I'm washing the fire and I'm cooking the soup.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
That's not a massive, hard task, though, is it?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, if that soup pot falls over... We're all staffed.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We're all f***ed. It's not a physically hard task, though, is it?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
That's all I'm going at. It's not a physically hard task.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Some of us are really working really hard.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
We're all sweating our balls off.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
We are. OK, mate, cook a pot of soup and we'll talk.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's all I'm saying.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
There are one or two people that are fantastic at

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
avoiding what they're meant to do

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
and looking busy doing very little.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I kind of think, like, if a tree falls in the forest

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and Vic's not there to hear it, it doesn't count.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Like, only work that he does

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
or work that people do right next to him counts.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
F*** that shit.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
The men on the island, they're spending every waking hour

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
in each other's company,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and they get no respite from the intensity of that soup.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And in many ways, it's little surprise

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
that they're starting to turn on each other.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
OK.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
This should be good.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
After a morning of hard labour,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
the hungry men sit down, hoping to enjoy Sam's soup.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
God, it smells funky, doesn't it?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Smells like crap.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
There is some distinct smell of poo about this.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it? Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I just couldn't swallow it.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I literally couldn't swallow it.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It almost made me puke.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
After a barely edible lunch,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Vic is determined to have a decent dinner.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I might fish.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
What choice do I have?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't want to eat limpets again, they're crap.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I'll eat them, but they're crap.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Flagging after their morning chores,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
the rest of the men decide to stay behind and camp.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Everything's an effort.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's how I feel right now.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Knackered, boys.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Absolutely knackered.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Completely knackered.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Nobody asks me to go fishing,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
but they know I'll go fishing to get food.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And I know they're doing the daily chores,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
but guys just aren't going that extra yard.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Come on, boys.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Once you've finished your duties or you don't have much of a duty,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
that ain't end of the day, is it?

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
I am prejudiced against everybody that isn't me,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
because if you all did it my way, it'd be a much better place.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
But I provide for my family.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm a good father.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm a good husband.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I'm a good husband, I hope.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I hope I'm an excellent lover.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't know.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm going to cope without speaking to my wife and kids

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
for that length of time.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I've no idea.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I really don't know.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
No idea.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Gives me goosebumps.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Not sure.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Dude, you are an absolute fish-tickling bastard, aren't you?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Late afternoon.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Do you want a hamburger?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
After four hours of fishing,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Vic has single-handedly provided dinner for the rest of the men.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That is so hard.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm fucked.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Nobody been and got any coconut, no?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
No.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
It's getting harder and harder every day,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
coming back and seeing everybody laid on fucking beach

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
and I'm catching fish.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
No, I'm all right.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I don't need to sit down.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I need coconut.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I need water.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Coconuts we're getting tomorrow.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Fucking hell.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I thought we were going out for coconut or something.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
How difficult would it be for two or three lads to go across

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and get a bag full of coconuts?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Do you want me to do that as well?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Do you want me to do that as well?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Fed up of the group taking him for granted,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Vic's made a big decision.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Bollocks to it.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm not fishing any more.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Somebody else go fishing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I might have a couple of days off.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
See how everybody fares then.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
If somebody else has turned to step up to the plate.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Wowzers.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You've done incredibly well, Vic.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, you really have, mate.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
You've done it absolutely brilliantly.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
You absolutely nailed it.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Thanks so much.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I have a couple of things to say,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
and I'm unsure whether to say them now,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
cos I don't want to spoil the atmosphere,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
or save them till the end of the night.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
So, do I do them now?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Say them now.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Say them now?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Let's have them now.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
OK.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Today, I spent fishing all day on my own.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But we're all sat round here,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
happy as pigs in shit, eating, though, now,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and I went without a buddy.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Perhaps you shouldn't have gone without a buddy.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
But if I hadn't have gone when I went,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
we wouldn't all be eating.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I certainly don't want to be busting a gut

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
and come back to see people kipping, pampering,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
tossing it off, doing whatever.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's not fair. It's not fair.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
That's top and bottom of it.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It's not fair.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It's a very good point, Vic.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It is.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
And I'm glad you've raised it.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So, I'll put my rods down,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
you'll fish for your own snap,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
and I'll eat limpets like restiers.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The group's most skilled hunter

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
has gone on fishing strike.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
That's it?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Fish out.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
OK?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, that's fair.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Understood.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
The burden of finding food

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
will now fall on the rest of the men.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
We are knackered.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
We are screwed.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
We have relied solely on fish,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
rod catching,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
most of them from Vic.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But tomorrow, I'm a bit worried,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
cos I'm not sure the guys are going to cope.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It scares me.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
I think everyone's feeling a little bit sluggish today,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
aren't they?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
7am.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Dan and Sam Brown are on the early morning water run.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
How are you feeling after your little debate yesterday?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Oh, with Vic?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Pretty good?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I think Vic was just maybe

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
trying to pick a bit of a fight yesterday.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
He likes to push buttons.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I think he likes to niggle.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
He likes a little...

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
You know, he sort of...

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
He has this sort of, like,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
oh, I'm nice as pie, da-da-da.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Fuck off, he is.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Where's my hat?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Last night, 47-year-old Vic,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
the group's most successful hunter,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
announced that he was going on fishing strike.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm absolutely knackered.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Are you?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Just trudging out, catching fish and trudging back

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
day after day after day after day after day.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It's not fair.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
How many fishing lines have you hooked up before, Phil?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
None.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
The burden of finding a fish supper

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
now lies with the other men.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
There is no reserve.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
There's no larder that we have here at the moment.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So if we don't catch anything today, we don't eat.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Right, so where are the points to go fishing?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Although refusing to fish himself,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Vic doesn't want to go hungry,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
so he offers the men some advice.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Get your fish.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
So he offers the men some advice.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Get your hook and push it through the limb pit at the top.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
OK.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Then turn the limb pit and come back through the soft gel.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Feel, feel, feel.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Boom.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
But if hidden on it, I would say just hidden

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
and right on the edge.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Cos they nibble on the edge

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and they want them to just nibble it and get caught.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You undermine me every time when I start telling about stuff

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
and it's rude.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Please don't do it.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Sorry, Vic.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
OK?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I thought I was adding to you.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
No.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So if you put two limb pits on...

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He was very quick to swipe at me

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
and I think maybe Vic has lost perspective a little bit.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
He thinks that he's the kingpin

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and that he is providing more than anyone else

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
and doing more than everyone else.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't know if he feels he needs to contribute,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
so if we all think he's contributed or...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't know, but it's rude.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
He shouldn't do it.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
I'm thinking three, maybe four bottles around each pole

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
and then just like that all the way along.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
We are going to adapt and overcome.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
36-year-old Will has come up with an ambitious plan

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
to fish the deeper waters surrounding the island.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
We've got to make a raft

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
so we can get in the middle of the channel,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
massive hook, big fish bait.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I would love to have a tuna.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That would be the best day ever.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Imagine that.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Sashimi.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
We don't have any oil drums or anything.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
What we've got on this island

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
is shedloads of empty plastic bottles.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Fingers crossed she'll float.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Right.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's get cracking.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
While he waits for the men to find him food,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Vic takes the opportunity

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
to make a bed for himself.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
So unlike the others,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
he'll be protected from critters on the jungle floor.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Look at that natural twine.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
What an absolute biscuit.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, I'm happy with this so far.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I don't have a double bed, I'm afraid,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
so I can't interest my wife in sleeping with me this evening.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So I'm just going to single it up.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Having isolated himself from the other men,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Vic's thoughts are increasingly turning to family.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I had a very unnerving dream last night about home,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
which was very horrible.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
It woke me up in not such a pleasant mood.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm missing home desperately.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I keep thinking more and more about my wife and kids every day.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I could do with a kiss and a cuddle off my missus,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
squeeze the life out of a blesser.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
It's time to get to work.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.480
I'm

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
ready to go.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Will's raft is ready to set sail.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I came up with the idea,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I shall name this raft

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
after my two gorgeous daughters, Freya and Pippa.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Shall we call it Fripster?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Nice, mate.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'll get it, guys.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.480
It looks like a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks,

17:04.520 --> 17:07.680
because it is a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks.

17:07.720 --> 17:12.920
But our livelihood and our dependency on food relies on it.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.720
So go on, Fripster.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.840
Fingers crossed we're in orbit launch.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.760
Get some fish.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.440
I name this boat Fripster the First.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.800
Long may she catch us fish from the deep.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.680
Right, on we get.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.240
Are you ready?

17:30.280 --> 17:33.720
You're sailing the Fripster Road.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.800
Come on, lads.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.680
See you in two weeks.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.040
Bye.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.200
She floats!

17:42.240 --> 17:44.000
She floats!

17:44.040 --> 17:48.120
I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivor's arsenal

17:48.160 --> 17:51.840
is resourcefulness, being able to look at an everyday object

17:51.880 --> 17:56.760
and think of clever, ingenious ways of using it to help you.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.920
The risks are big,

17:57.920 --> 18:01.600
but the spoils could be even bigger if that raft succeeds.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.040
Bigger strokes, mate.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.280
Reach.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.920
After a huge joint effort from all the men,

18:06.960 --> 18:10.200
apart from Vic, the raft appears to be a success.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.280
Most of the group are now out trying to catch supper.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.800
I've not got the patience for fishing, I tell you that for nothing.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.840
Leaving the gruelling job of firewood to Vic, an IT consultant,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.280
Kyle.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.120
Kyle, why do we need a shitload more kindling today than we have done?

18:33.160 --> 18:34.440
It's not heavy stuff, is it?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.440
Yeah.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.240
Kyle's still quite gifted at doing very little.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.800
But that's the problem with intelligent people,

18:40.840 --> 18:43.520
because they think they're cleverer than the people

18:43.560 --> 18:45.160
that they're out doing the job for.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.080
They think they can out-think them.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.280
When it comes to manual labour, Jesus Christ, lads,

18:49.320 --> 18:50.360
stop getting all crazy.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.760
It's manual labour, which is every job we've got.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.640
I think on this island there will be people that come off,

18:57.640 --> 19:01.800
physically bollocks, regardless of diet, whether we eat or we don't eat,

19:01.840 --> 19:04.240
and there'll be guys come off who aren't.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.240
And if we're not all hanging out of our arse at the end of this,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.240
somebody hasn't been working hard enough, have they?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.640
Would you agree with that?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.680
No, it could happen where we're not all spent.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.160
We work hard as a team, we achieve a lot,

19:15.200 --> 19:18.440
and at the end, we're not all sort of hanging out of our arses.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.640
That could happen. What the fuck are you talking about?

19:20.680 --> 19:22.640
I'm talking English. I'm just talking English.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.640
I'm uneducated, you have to lower it down to my level.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.120
What, didn't you understand? The term we use in Yorkshire,

19:27.120 --> 19:29.760
layman's terms, every job is a manual job.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.200
Do we agree? Yeah. Yeah.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.320
So, if we all plough into that 100% manually,

19:35.360 --> 19:37.480
we will all be bollocksed at the end of this journey.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.720
I've already said I don't think at the end of this...

19:39.760 --> 19:41.360
Right, then, let me just say it again, then.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.720
All it goes on about is this is a physical place,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.640
every task in here is physical.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.120
Whoop-de-doo. You know, that's brilliant,

19:48.160 --> 19:51.680
but we're not all just grunts that have been sent out here

19:51.720 --> 19:53.120
to bash on bits of wood.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.960
You can talk your way around whatever you want,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.880
top and bottom of it is, it's a physical island,

19:56.880 --> 20:00.200
every job is physical, we should all be bollocksed.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.320
If not, somebody's carrying somebody else.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.280
That's the top and bottom of it.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.760
Mid-afternoon.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.760
Still reeling from yesterday's argument

20:26.760 --> 20:30.240
with Vic, Sam Brown is trying to catch some dinner.

20:32.280 --> 20:37.200
Vic keeps making little remarks to me that just make me seethe.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.000
So, what was getting his goat this morning?

20:39.040 --> 20:40.880
Oh, mate, a whole load of things.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.000
If we can catch some fish...

20:42.040 --> 20:44.000
Hopefully, Vic will be in a slightly better mood.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.640
After three hours on the water,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.280
Barney and Sam haven't had a single bite.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.600
So, what are you thinking with this rod?

20:54.640 --> 20:55.920
I'm thinking, I don't know,

20:55.960 --> 20:56.640
maybe they always...

20:56.640 --> 20:58.960
They always say, patience is a virtue, don't they?

20:59.000 --> 21:03.080
And I'm quite impatient.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.520
Is that line tight?

21:06.560 --> 21:07.920
No.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.040
No, no bite.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.760
Oh, fuck it, let's go in.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.960
With nightfall approaching, the other men also return to camp.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.200
Vic is waiting to see how many fish they have caught

21:26.200 --> 21:27.200
in his absence.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.880
No joy, fella?

21:30.920 --> 21:34.600
No, I had a nice day fishing, as you'd say, Vic.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.960
Not catching.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.240
Old dogs should learn new tricks.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.360
Listen when I tell him.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.080
Did you not listen?

21:41.120 --> 21:42.120
No.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.600
Four hours fishing and one poxy trigger.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.880
I fucking hate fishing.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.080
It's exhausting just standing there in the sun

21:56.080 --> 21:59.040
for X amount of hours.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.520
Charlie caught a fish.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.320
Well, that ain't feeding nobody, is it?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.120
That ain't feeding Jack shit.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.280
It's just limpets again.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.880
The men's attempts to provide dinner without Vic's help

22:16.920 --> 22:18.520
have been a miserable failure.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.720
Desperation corner over here.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.840
Mm-hm.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.880
The pressure is on me to feed everybody.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.040
It's almost as though I am expected to grab a rod

22:29.080 --> 22:32.200
and go out and catch fish so everybody else can eat.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.720
And that ain't good. I don't like that.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.040
See you in the morning, ladies.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.480
With no food in camp, Vic opts for an early night in his new bed.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.760
You on the beach, sir?

22:43.800 --> 22:44.800
Oh, dear.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.520
Oh, yeah.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.400
Let me get myself ready for bed.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.480
Oh, dear.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.400
Oh, dear.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.320
Oh, dear, God, yeah, that's lovely.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.360
That is...

22:58.400 --> 23:00.160
He has to remember that we are a team here

23:00.200 --> 23:03.360
and with certain things, he is quite selfish.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.120
Does not get any better, does it?

23:06.160 --> 23:09.600
For a family man, I might have expected him to be

23:09.640 --> 23:11.680
more considerate of others.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.840
Oh!

23:14.720 --> 23:17.320
Oh, boys, you don't know what you're missing!

23:28.200 --> 23:32.880
While on fishing strike, 47-year-old Vic has built himself a raised bed.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.640
MUSIC FADES

23:34.680 --> 23:36.360
Mm, yeah, that was a good night's sleep.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.680
I had some lovely dreams.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.800
For some reason, one of us knew Jonathan Ross

23:41.840 --> 23:44.160
and we ended up in his house,

23:44.200 --> 23:47.320
trying to catch his fish out of his fish tank.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
Can't think why.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.440
Oh!

23:52.480 --> 23:54.000
Oh, I love my bed.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.960
Protected from the jungle critters,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.040
Vic has had his best sleep yet.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.280
WHISTLE BLOWS

24:05.040 --> 24:07.440
While the others have had their worst.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.880
Oh, my legs are a bit into shit, my arms are a bit into shit.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.120
Sleeping rough on the jungle floor,

24:16.160 --> 24:19.960
the men have been attacked overnight by a swarm of sandflies.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.640
They're everywhere, covered in them.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.680
They must have, you know, 500 bites or so.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.040
I'm just not having a good reaction to them.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.040
And they're starting to swell up.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.080
You may think on a desert island,

24:31.120 --> 24:34.680
your real enemies are the crocs, the scorpions, the snakes,

24:34.720 --> 24:38.080
but actually it's often the little things you can't see.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.120
And worse of these are sandflies.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.120
They're super itchy, ten times worse than a mosquito.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.760
You scratch away, it's hot, it's humid,

24:45.800 --> 24:48.400
and that's when the bites can become infected.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.760
They have had a monster.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.920
It's a massive gore.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.960
Oh!

24:59.920 --> 25:00.920
Oh!

25:02.120 --> 25:06.600
This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in

25:06.640 --> 25:08.080
or eat you alive.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.880
Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.000
Reeling from last night's infestation,

25:23.040 --> 25:24.880
the men call an emergency meeting.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.960
I've got to put my hands up and say my insulated bones are so bad,

25:28.000 --> 25:28.960
I can barely walk.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.960
I can't even walk, I can't even go in the sun.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.960
So I'm happy to chop wood and stuff in here,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.960
but if I go in the sun, my legs just flare up

25:36.000 --> 25:36.960
and I can't even move them.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.960
Tomorrow I might be down, but today is absolutely excruciating.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.960
It's like someone's puffing fire into my calves when I move them.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.960
My worry with these bites,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.960
cos they just seem to be, like, escalating a notch,

25:50.000 --> 25:50.960
like, that's...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.960
I worry that, what with all the rain,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.760
some other kind of bug might come up,

25:54.760 --> 25:58.000
a bug might have hatched and might be starting to feast on us.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.800
Today, priorities.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.240
I think we just concentrate on just trying to get

26:02.280 --> 26:04.080
as many of these beds up as possible.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.760
Raised beds are the group's best protection against further attacks.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
Right, are you ready? Cos this one might jump.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.720
Having built his own yesterday,

26:17.760 --> 26:22.320
Vic temporarily ends his work to rule to lend a helping hand.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.640
I think all of us, there's a full team of 11,

26:24.640 --> 26:27.600
get stuck into beds, everybody's bed.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.600
Come on, give it some.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.600
Come on, it ticked!

26:30.640 --> 26:33.600
I might be quite pushy with it, so we really get stuck into it.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.600
Scamp on it, fella.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.600
All 11 stone here.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.600
Bingo!

26:39.640 --> 26:42.600
Whoo! That's what a bit of graft does for you, boys!

26:42.640 --> 26:43.600
Whoo!

26:43.640 --> 26:46.600
Right, my furor, what do you think?

26:46.640 --> 26:47.600
Perfect.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.520
With all available hands,

26:54.520 --> 26:57.480
with hands on beds and nobody hunting or fishing,

26:57.520 --> 27:00.480
cameraman Sam Brown has once again spent the morning

27:00.520 --> 27:03.480
trying to conjure up something for lunch.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.480
I feel a little bit like this child catcher this morning.

27:06.520 --> 27:10.480
We're going to boil them all to death and then eat them with soup.

27:10.520 --> 27:14.480
Shush, my pretties, it's nearly over.

27:14.520 --> 27:18.480
I think the only job I haven't done so far on this tour

27:18.520 --> 27:21.480
is the difficult task of cooking.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.480
Mmm, cooking.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.440
Right, Sam, there's guys up there busting their knackers.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.440
I don't know how many blisters.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.440
I'm going to help the lads with wood, that's all.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.440
I've just been up to help the lads with wood

27:32.480 --> 27:34.440
and there's no more for me to carry down.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.440
Let's chop some down, then.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.440
If he keeps going like that, you know, I'll react.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.440
You know, I know I will.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.440
It's good for us to vent. Fucking hell.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.440
Shit!

27:48.480 --> 27:51.440
It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.

27:51.440 --> 27:55.400
You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!

27:55.440 --> 27:58.400
Makes us all feel much better.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.400
They're chopping wood, they're not busting your guts.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.400
I can't help them chop more because I don't have a fucking machete.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.400
He's only got three and a half.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.400
A leaderless group fighting to stay alive

28:07.440 --> 28:09.400
is always going to face conflict.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.400
And what happens is individuals tend to push their own agendas

28:12.440 --> 28:16.400
and that, in turn, takes away valuable time and valuable energy

28:16.440 --> 28:18.400
for the things that really matter.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.400
How's the soup looking, Sam?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.400
Really good, mate. Really, really good.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.400
Your three-and-a-half-hour making soup could be done in 25 minutes.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.400
You want to...? Really?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.400
How difficult can stirring soup be?

28:34.440 --> 28:37.400
To some, it would look like you didn't want to go do the harder job.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.400
Excuse me?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.400
Some would say it's because you didn't want to go bust a gut.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.400
I would say, fuck you to that person. That's what I'd say.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.400
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.400
Shall we just calm it down a bit?

28:46.440 --> 28:48.400
We're here for another, what, three or four weeks?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.400
Just let's fucking calm down, eh?

28:50.400 --> 28:52.360
There's no need to be like this.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.360
So you're saying I'm avoiding graft, Vic? Is that what you're saying?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.360
Are you?

28:57.400 --> 29:00.360
That sounded very much like you were just a second ago.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.360
You're answering the question with the question, are you?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.360
What? Are you?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.360
What? Am I avoiding graft? Yeah.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.360
I fucking don't think so, man.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.360
Then why are you biting, then? What?

29:09.400 --> 29:12.360
Cos you've been niggling for weeks.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.360
Have I?

29:13.400 --> 29:15.360
This is what it boils down to for me, Vic.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.360
You act like certain jobs are like macho jobs,

29:18.400 --> 29:20.360
fishing, chopping wood, everything else,

29:20.360 --> 29:21.320
women's work.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.320
That's the feeling I get, right?

29:23.360 --> 29:25.320
And if that's cooking, that's fucking carrying water,

29:25.360 --> 29:27.320
whatever it is, in your head, it's like,

29:27.360 --> 29:30.320
this is graft, this is good, everything else, not difficult.

29:30.360 --> 29:34.320
I think feeding everybody is one of the most important jobs on this island.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.320
So do I.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.320
Every job is a manual job.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.320
Some jobs, boom, they're done. 25 minutes, they're done.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.320
And every three quarts of an hour, you steer it.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.320
Is that right?

29:43.360 --> 29:47.320
What I'm trying to do, Vic, is get as many good meals out of this as I can, right?

29:47.360 --> 29:49.320
Rather than just use it once and throw it away.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.280
You don't need it.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.280
Yeah.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.280
So maybe just keep your comments to yourself if you don't know about it, huh?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.280
I thought we were allowed to hear his comments.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.280
Yeah, well, it's great, but if you want to fucking, like,

30:02.320 --> 30:05.280
if you want to piss me off, you're going about it the right way.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.280
Some jobs are physically easy, some jobs aren't.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.280
Is that a better way to put it?

30:14.320 --> 30:17.280
You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy

30:17.320 --> 30:19.280
and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320
We have a warning for you, mate.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.320
Oh, baby!

30:36.320 --> 30:38.280
We look absolutely furious.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.280
If a mate said that to me, I'd fucking hit them, you know?

30:42.320 --> 30:46.280
If someone at work said that, we'd have trouble, you know?

30:46.320 --> 30:49.280
Fucking butt. I'd just... I'd take...

30:49.280 --> 30:51.560
There's no good way to take that, right?

30:51.600 --> 30:55.920
I take that as, like, a stab at my integrity.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.360
Fuck it, man.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.880
I look forward to sitting down in some 25-minute soup at some stage.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.840
We have built the honeymoon suite.

31:16.840 --> 31:20.520
It is strong enough for the rampy-pampy, you'll see, yeah.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.960
4pm.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.040
After a day of hard graft, the beds are finished.

31:27.280 --> 31:30.320
Welcome to the chateau.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.760
Let's open the curtain.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.320
And that there is the most uncomfortable beds

31:38.360 --> 31:40.000
anyone will ever sleep on.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.320
Oh!

31:45.360 --> 31:46.800
This is where the magic happens.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.880
It's not too bad, actually.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.920
I will say one thing. What?

31:50.960 --> 31:53.760
Right above your head, a lot of daylight.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.800
That, Piers, is my skylight.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.040
The men will now have better protection from the jungle critters.

32:03.080 --> 32:08.240
But the day of hard physical labour has left them hungry and shattered.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.360
I am running on empty.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.760
I feel like I'm lugging my body about.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.640
I can't even stand up straight.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.560
I'm starting to sweat.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.320
I'm starting to sway, so I can just slurp my words a bit.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.600
Since Vic went on fishing strike,

32:25.640 --> 32:30.040
the men have survived on Sam's leftover soup and slithers of coconut.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.440
And Vic isn't impressed.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.560
If I eat any more of this shit, I'm going to puke.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
It's horrible.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.480
Coconut.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.200
Yay!

32:44.240 --> 32:46.400
That's your shit sort of iron needle.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.320
Mother Nature, you can be a cruel, cruel mistress.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.480
Do you know that?

32:53.400 --> 32:54.600
She's not going to beat me.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.720
There's nothing going to beat me.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.200
Fucking hellfire.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.400
Disgusting.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.960
Ah, screw it. That's it. I've had enough.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.800
Come on, Victor, let's have some fish.

33:20.280 --> 33:24.840
Despite Vic's strike, he's determined to catch a decent fish supper

33:24.880 --> 33:27.520
and persuades Kyle to join him on the raft.

33:29.880 --> 33:34.080
Instead of catching little fish, I want to be catching some that are bigger.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.400
What's getting out of you?

33:36.560 --> 33:42.400
With my health and safety hat on, I'd be more worried that we've got a homemade raft

33:42.440 --> 33:46.400
in some very strong currents in a very deep piece of water.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.560
Vic and Kyle are already 200 yards from shore.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.880
Should something happen, they're dangerously out of their depth.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.960
Oh, this is something, Vic.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.080
Ooh.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.560
Has Daddy got a tug?

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
Oh!

34:02.840 --> 34:03.840
Do you have a tug?

34:03.880 --> 34:04.840
Oh!

34:04.880 --> 34:07.160
I think Daddy might have a tug, pal.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.120
Get on the end of that, kid.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.640
Feel the end of that.

34:10.680 --> 34:12.400
I'm not sure what it is.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.240
What the fuck is that?

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
I don't know.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.240
I don't know.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
What's that?

34:17.280 --> 34:20.320
What the effing hell is that?

34:20.360 --> 34:23.080
We've got ourselves a fucking eel, kid!

34:23.120 --> 34:25.120
You, sir, are going fucking nowhere.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.160
Can you hold that for me?

34:26.200 --> 34:27.200
Yeah, of course.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.240
Thank you.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.200
Right, now I've pinned him.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.680
Pinned him down to the side.

34:33.640 --> 34:34.640
Good man.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.280
I now need to club him with something, and I think that might be this.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.760
Have I got plenty of space?

34:42.880 --> 34:44.280
Oh, yes.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.760
Yeah, I do believe that's him.

34:46.240 --> 34:47.840
As we speak now.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.440
Right, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.440
Oh, you fucker, yeah.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.240
I don't like this fucking fighting bat bollocks at all.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.280
I really don't.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.080
They're 200, 300, 400 yards out now.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.200
And still going.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.280
One of the most precious resources that the men actually have

35:14.320 --> 35:15.240
is their own energy.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.200
Yeah.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.920
They're living hand-to-mouth, struggling for every mouthful of food.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.920
The temptation is to go to greater and greater lengths

35:22.960 --> 35:25.360
to get that precious energy.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
Right, that's it.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.000
I can now tie you up.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.440
Safely.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.680
But here's the danger.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.720
The more malnourished the men get,

35:32.760 --> 35:35.440
the more their judgement gets impaired.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.960
That's when the small mistakes become full-blown emergencies,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.920
and that can happen in the blink of an eye.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.920
Two of those, pretty nice bat.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.000
Come on.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.800
That's one hell of a tide, isn't it?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.200
They're getting carried.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.720
We are going backwards.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.520
Right, go on, paddle, paddle, paddle. Don't stop.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.280
Vic and Kyle are attempting to paddle back to the beach.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.640
I don't like this, mate.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.800
No, neither do I.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.480
Start paddling now!

36:04.640 --> 36:07.800
But they've been caught by a powerful undercurrent.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.360
Paddle.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.840
Paddle, guys!

36:11.760 --> 36:13.800
Come on!

36:13.840 --> 36:14.920
You all right?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.600
I think the current's got them.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.200
Come on!

36:18.240 --> 36:19.400
Come on, let's go.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.560
Fucking hell.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.600
Come on!

36:28.640 --> 36:31.120
Come on, boy!

36:31.160 --> 36:33.160
Yeah!

36:33.200 --> 36:34.480
We're going to crash, though!

36:34.520 --> 36:35.400
Come on!

36:35.440 --> 36:36.640
At the mercy of the current,

36:36.680 --> 36:41.240
the raft is on a collision course with the island's treacherous rocky coastline,

36:41.280 --> 36:43.320
which could tear the men to shreds.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.680
Come on, Kyle, dig the fucker in.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.680
Paddle, paddle!

36:46.720 --> 36:48.080
And turn again, you know.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.600
Oh, baby.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.840
It'll... Right, paddle, paddle!

36:51.880 --> 36:52.880
Paddle!

36:52.920 --> 36:54.320
Don't stop, don't stop.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.920
No!

36:57.920 --> 37:01.000
Everybody safe? Everybody OK? No injuries?

37:01.040 --> 37:03.320
Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord for that.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.320
After surviving a near-death experience,

37:07.360 --> 37:10.320
the men are shaken, but physically unscathed.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.400
It all got mangled up and chaffed up.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.840
Their raft, though, is destroyed.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.240
That must have been fucking scary, man.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.240
Yeah, it was.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
We were getting smashed on the rocks and everything,

37:25.320 --> 37:27.440
so I do appreciate that.

37:28.720 --> 37:33.880
Sam and Dan's swift actions saved Vic and Kyle from annihilation on the rocks.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.960
It was fucking hairy, mate.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.840
Like, that was... I think that was the closest I've been to coughing on this trip.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.480
Thanks for coming and helping us, guys.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.200
Let's get back to camp before dark.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.200
Yeah, yeah.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.640
First light tomorrow, we'll try and salvage as much of this as we can.

37:52.240 --> 37:56.320
With their raft in tatters and Vic's eel lost to the ocean,

37:56.360 --> 37:59.240
the men now face a second night with empty stomachs.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.920
Where the hell's the rest of the raft?

38:10.960 --> 38:13.000
Oh, shit, is that the raft?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.560
The tripster is no longer, boys.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.600
Yes.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.600
Vic's got a brave face, hasn't he?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.120
But he's really shook up.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.040
He could have just been knocked unconscious,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.120
brain splattered out in a rock.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.680
He could have died.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.200
Like, actually, he could have died.

38:28.360 --> 38:31.960
Vic's near-death experience isn't the only thing on his mind.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.320
It's been a little bit quite difficult today, truth's known, for me.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.000
It's come up to fifth, which is the date of my first date with my missus.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And I'm missing her immensely.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.840
So, tomorrow, I may spend lots and lots of time

38:46.880 --> 38:50.400
contemplating my missus and all that sort of thing.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.040
Morning.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.240
Oh, that was a good sleep.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.680
Oh, morning.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.000
I'm so happy.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.000
I'm so happy.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.120
Good morning.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.200
After a savage sandfly attack 24 hours ago,

39:16.240 --> 39:18.080
the men have spent their first night

39:18.120 --> 39:21.120
raised off the ground in their own beds.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.240
Good morning.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.960
Oh, last night was wonderful.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.040
Last night was the best unbroken sleep I've had by a mile.

39:32.440 --> 39:36.240
This time, it's Vic who hasn't slept a wink.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.400
Vic looks like he spent the entire night sitting on a fence post.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.840
The poor bugger looks absolutely drained.

39:40.840 --> 39:41.960
He's got a lot of strain today.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.800
He's got a lot of strain today.

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
He's got a lot of strain today.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.440
Victor looks a little bit edgy today.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.680
I can see him cracking a little bit.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.000
Hopefully, he's all right.

39:54.040 --> 39:57.560
You know, he's not the kind of guy who would show his emotions.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.920
He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.720
He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.800
Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.920
Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.

40:08.960 --> 40:09.920
Never again.

40:09.960 --> 40:10.640
Never again.

40:10.640 --> 40:11.840
Never again.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.240
Never in this long.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.160
The greatest thing that ever happened to me,

40:17.200 --> 40:19.560
other than being born, was my wife.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.520
I can't wait to get back to Cheryl.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.320
Smell her, taste her, touch her, feel her.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.520
All them things.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.840
I love that woman so much.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.200
It's immense.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.880
Truly immense.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.400
As human beings, when we're stripped of everything,

40:33.440 --> 40:36.360
the real essence of who we are is laid bare.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.740
Every single one of them

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
It is just a nature of survival.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.740
It's a nature of enduring hardship.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.740
If you can take a long, hard look at yourself

40:46.740 --> 40:48.740
when you're at your lowest ebb,

40:48.740 --> 40:51.740
and in that moment you can accept what you see,

40:51.740 --> 40:54.740
in my eye, that's what makes you a true survivor.

40:57.740 --> 41:00.740
Devastated. Absolutely devastated.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.740
This is literally what we were getting smashed against yesterday.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.740
It's so dangerous.

41:05.740 --> 41:06.740
Yeah.

41:06.740 --> 41:11.740
Oh, I feel so dreadful at the moment. It's unbelievable.

41:11.740 --> 41:14.740
This beautiful, dangerous paradise can be a killer.

41:14.740 --> 41:18.740
You take your eye off the ball and she's going to bite you in the arse.

41:18.740 --> 41:23.740
The raft crash will stay with me till the day I die.

41:23.740 --> 41:25.740
These guys saved my life.

41:29.740 --> 41:33.740
In camp, Vic calls the men together for a chat.

41:36.740 --> 41:39.740
I'd just like to say if I ever offended anybody, upset them,

41:39.740 --> 41:42.740
unduly, and it weren't deserved, then I apologise.

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
It won't happen again.

41:44.740 --> 41:48.740
I worry immensely about providing for me and mine,

41:48.740 --> 41:51.740
so perhaps that's why I compensate for working so physically hard,

41:51.740 --> 41:53.740
like a fool, like a donkey.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.740
I've got a fantastic wife and kids,

41:55.740 --> 41:59.740
but I have this overwhelming urge to provide.

41:59.740 --> 42:01.740
It drives me more than anything else,

42:01.740 --> 42:04.740
and the fear of not being able to do that is terrifying.

42:04.740 --> 42:05.740
Terrifying.

42:05.740 --> 42:10.740
Vic, the man that said a few weeks ago,

42:10.740 --> 42:15.740
erm, he does not see the point in crying...

42:17.740 --> 42:19.740
..cried.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.740
The way that you describe your wife and your family

42:23.740 --> 42:25.740
I find inspirational.

42:26.740 --> 42:31.740
I've never known a man to come away with a group of guys

42:31.740 --> 42:34.740
and to say, I love my wife to bits.

42:34.740 --> 42:37.740
She's the best thing I've ever experienced in my life.

42:37.740 --> 42:39.740
I never hear that.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.740
And that's one thing I'm going to take away from you.

42:41.740 --> 42:43.740
I'm going to take that.

42:43.740 --> 42:46.740
Every time you talk about Cheryl, like, I feel like she's in the room.

42:46.740 --> 42:48.740
Don't get me wrong, Vic, you've pissed me off

42:48.740 --> 42:50.740
more than just about anyone here.

42:50.740 --> 42:53.740
But overall, mate, you're worth every ounce of you.

42:53.740 --> 42:56.740
You've lifted us up more times than I can say.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.740
We'd be seriously worse off if you weren't here.

43:02.740 --> 43:04.740
I weren't expecting this. I won't be honest.

43:04.740 --> 43:06.740
Not at all.

43:06.740 --> 43:09.740
I expected difficulties and hungers and confrontation and conflict,

43:09.740 --> 43:11.740
but not to find something out about me.

43:11.740 --> 43:13.740
That was the last thing I expected.

43:17.740 --> 43:20.740
What a great bunch of blokes these really are.

43:20.740 --> 43:22.740
What a great bunch of blokes.

43:22.740 --> 43:25.740
I ain't never going to see eye to eye with them all,

43:25.740 --> 43:27.740
but on this island, it's a family.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.740
It's the island family.

43:34.740 --> 43:36.740
It's the island family.

43:39.740 --> 43:42.740
Vic calls an end to his fishing strike

43:42.740 --> 43:46.740
and heads out on his own to catch dinner for the group.

43:46.740 --> 43:49.740
Nice and steady. Nice and fucking steady.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
Hold your ground.

43:51.740 --> 43:53.740
We're good. We're good. We're good.

43:56.740 --> 44:00.740
It's been three days since the men had anything substantial to eat

44:00.740 --> 44:03.740
and they are obsessing about food.

44:03.740 --> 44:05.740
There was this documentary about some women

44:05.740 --> 44:09.740
that were still breastfeeding kids at the age of, was it three, four?

44:09.740 --> 44:13.740
I always think that the longer you're on the breast, the better.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.740
What, eight, nine? Yeah.

44:15.740 --> 44:18.740
I think if you're taken off the breast too early...

44:18.740 --> 44:20.740
You become short. ..it stunts your growth.

44:25.740 --> 44:27.740
Well, hello!

44:27.740 --> 44:29.740
Gentlemen. Yes, Vic.

44:29.740 --> 44:32.740
How are we all? What did you get, Vic?

44:32.740 --> 44:36.740
I wish I had a fish for each of us, but alas, I don't.

44:36.740 --> 44:37.740
Oh.

44:37.740 --> 44:39.740
What I can say, though, is this.

44:39.740 --> 44:41.740
Of the five fish I've caught...

44:41.740 --> 44:43.740
Hello! Hello!

44:43.740 --> 44:46.740
..two are the biggest I have ever caught in all my life.

44:46.740 --> 44:49.740
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:51.740 --> 44:54.740
And one of them is the size of a small dog.

44:54.740 --> 44:56.740
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:56.740 --> 44:58.740
Yeah, boy!

44:58.740 --> 45:00.740
Daddy brought home the bacon.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.740
Yeah! Yeah!

45:02.740 --> 45:04.740
They are massive, Vickers!

45:04.740 --> 45:07.740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

45:07.740 --> 45:09.740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

45:09.740 --> 45:11.740
For he's a jolly good fellow!

45:11.740 --> 45:13.740
And so say all of us!

45:13.740 --> 45:15.740
He's back to normal Vic fellows.

45:15.740 --> 45:16.740
Woo!

45:16.740 --> 45:18.740
Shouting and whooping and getting fish and stuff like that,

45:18.740 --> 45:19.740
everything that he loves.

45:19.740 --> 45:21.740
Look at the size of that, bitch.

45:21.740 --> 45:22.740
Oh!

45:27.740 --> 45:29.740
Fripster will sail again.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.740
Fripster 2 will sail again.

45:32.740 --> 45:34.740
I can't get the Titanic theme tune in my head.

45:34.740 --> 45:36.740
That was like Titanic.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.740
See, if I was Kate Winslet, who was Leonardo?

45:38.740 --> 45:40.740
LAUGHTER

45:40.740 --> 45:42.740
Oh, it's small.

45:46.740 --> 45:49.740
Sometimes I like to smash him repeatedly in the face,

45:49.740 --> 45:52.740
but I think me and Vic were in danger of becoming quite good friends.

45:52.740 --> 45:54.740
Huge respect for the guy.

45:54.740 --> 45:57.740
Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick!

45:57.740 --> 45:59.740
Woo!

45:59.740 --> 46:01.740
When in doubt, send Vic out!

46:01.740 --> 46:03.740
Yeah!

46:05.740 --> 46:07.740
Next time on The Women's Island...

46:07.740 --> 46:09.740
You are not leaving this island.

46:09.740 --> 46:12.740
I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back.

46:12.740 --> 46:15.740
The one thing we need for George is food.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.740
Get the knife! Get the knife!

46:17.740 --> 46:19.740
Come here, come here, come here!

46:19.740 --> 46:22.740
I think it's about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal.

46:22.740 --> 46:24.740
There, there, there, there, there.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.740
Go.

46:25.740 --> 46:26.740
HE GRUNTS

46:26.740 --> 46:28.740
