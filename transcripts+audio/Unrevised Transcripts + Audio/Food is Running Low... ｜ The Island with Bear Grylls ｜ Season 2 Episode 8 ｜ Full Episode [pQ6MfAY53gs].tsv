0	14560	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14560	22960	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be
22960	33700	utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything
33700	39460	themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance hello you can see Pierce's heart beating
39460	51580	through the rib will it be brute power or mental strength the Windsor day who will have what it
51580	52900	takes to stay alive
52960	65080	tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than ever they'll have to find
65080	70720	water and hunt for their own food that is the biggest shocker I've ever seen living on the
70720	80820	island in the middle of tropical storm season we expected to survive it when pitted against
80820	81580	the extremes of nature
82960	91000	and these Monday women got what it takes to survive guys come back here really slowly
91000	110800	it's been almost three weeks since I dropped 14 women off on this remote Pacific Island radio in
110800	112800	now medic now
112960	118280	they're three people down I thought she'd hang on in there and with fewer women to hunt and food running
118280	124720	dangerously low surely I'm gonna die soon spa owner Abby one of the oldest of the women has kept the
124720	135400	group together she encouraged the others to make a difficult but necessary survival choice to eat
135400	139500	their pet pigs I don't know about anyone else but I feel like a wild animal
142960	161960	what's your assessment of the situation hairdresser there's a vocabulary for hairdressers so as not to offend the client so I'm always subtle in my work so I'd say it's f***ing had it
161960	167820	after weeks on the island stripped of all luxuries Abby is improvising in her island salon with a novel blue rinse it's probably permanent boat paint or something
167820	171960	it's probably permanent boat paint or something
172960	179960	basins are over there the junior will see to it
179960	182960	quite happy now I've done a bit of hairdressing
182960	189960	oh look at the colour of the sea that's what we want to swim in
189960	199960	in a group like this when you're really starving and struggling all you need is that one person to kind of shine a little beacon of light and say something really witty and funny
199960	202960	and Abby is that person
202960	204960	it's 95 pound please
212960	213960	the oven's broken
213960	215960	thanks chef
215960	217960	oh my god
217960	222960	it's been days since women ate the piglets and they haven't had a decent meal since
222960	227960	can I have it with sand please I don't think I've got enough sand in my mouth
227960	230960	they're back to eating scraps of foraged coconut and yucca
230960	231960	and starvation isn't fair
232960	234960	and their wife is far away
234960	235960	did you notice it was on fire
235960	236960	oh wow
236960	246960	you're getting a really burnt one
246960	247960	with some eating as little as a dangerously low 200 calories a day
247960	250960	any stores they started off with are basically gone
250960	257960	so the women need to go all out to increase their food intake and their lives are going to depend on that
257960	259960	I'm psyched like you did
259960	260960	spit that out
260960	261960	it's too burnt
261960	266760	that's disgusting i was saying a couple of days ago in jest that i feel like my body's
266760	277000	digesting itself but i just know more i am eating myself from the inside i'm just hoping that we can
277640	284680	get some food do you know what my favorite thing to do at the minute is i go to the imaginary
284680	289560	supermarket in my head with a shopping trolley empty and go up and down the aisles and do
289560	295640	shopping i spent about 10 minutes in the jam and condiments section yesterday did you what did you
295640	300840	get well i mean i went to the i bought marmalade i got shredded and smooth in the edge because i
300840	304520	didn't know what to do and i was going along because i'd obviously bought the imaginary pate
304520	307960	so that i needed to debate which imaginary condiment would go best and then i got to
307960	312520	the bakery and i didn't know whether i wanted crusty bread or soft bread this is the mind of
312520	319240	a lunatic in terms of survival skills i think i'm quite mentally strong
319240	319480	and i'm not a person who's just going to go around doing a lot of stuff but i'm not a person who's
319480	319520	going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to
319520	319540	i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to
319540	321620	I don't think there's much that will rattle me,
321620	324780	but then I've never really been pushed to my limits before.
324780	327500	The biggest challenge is being able to go for a long period
327500	329460	without a good dinner in my belly.
329460	331900	I don't think myself as a natural hunter-gatherer,
331900	335300	but in 34 years, nothing's got between me and Emil yet.
335300	337660	So if there's food on that island, I'll find it.
343700	345540	Unable to digest yucca,
345540	348900	the women's breakfast is not agreeing with Georgina.
348900	350580	I've been sick again. I can't stop.
350580	351900	Oh, my God!
351900	354500	I don't know what I'm... There's nothing to suck up, though.
356060	357300	Are you drinking enough?
357300	359900	Yeah, I've just tried to drink a little more.
359900	361460	I'm driving you mad.
361460	365980	Camp doctor Belinda is concerned about Georgina's condition.
365980	370340	George literally exists on a couple of limpets a day
370340	372180	and maybe a couple of snails.
372180	377020	She does not eat more than about that much tiny square of coconut a day,
377020	378620	so she's probably consuming
378620	381700	under 20 calories per day.
381700	383940	And it's just not sustainable.
383940	387260	Georgina's inability to digest their limited diet
387260	390340	means she could be putting her vital organs at risk.
390340	392980	You had some recting, yeah?
392980	397220	Yeah, well, this is one of the major reasons
397220	400420	why I'm worried about your kidneys.
400420	402340	So we'll just get your temperature.
405060	408420	I mean, I can literally feel my muscles within my body.
408620	410740	They're really wasting away.
410740	414100	Er, and I just heard that was messed up at one of them.
416620	420180	I just need to get some food. Just something.
420180	422980	Because if I don't, then it could be endgame for me, really,
422980	424740	with regards to being on the island.
431220	432420	Off we go.
434540	438420	Everyone is now pitching in to try and find protein that they can share
438420	440100	with Georgina.
440100	443020	A group led by Abi are scouring the shoreline.
446540	449180	They're very hard to get off.
449180	451100	Look at the size of that monster.
451100	452540	Can I have a try? You can.
452540	455180	Just have a try at just banging it.
455180	456540	Do you say that to your boyfriend?
456540	458860	Yeah!
458860	459860	Limp it.
463100	465300	So you've got the cool, the warms and the natural,
465300	467700	so that's got to slight.
467700	470260	It's got a lilac-y tinge in it, but it's nice.
470260	471780	I run my own business.
471780	474460	Sales for last month is really, really good.
474460	477780	I like being in charge of people and a team.
477780	480860	I'll work at something till I am successful at it.
480860	481860	I have a bad back.
481860	484740	It causes me quite a lot of problems and quite a lot of pain.
484740	487420	I get through it and I don't let it stop me doing anything at the moor.
487420	491500	I'll snow ski, I'll ride, I'll push myself.
491500	492500	Good lad.
495380	495820	First day we came up... Yeah. ..they were like,
495820	496820	Yeah.
496820	498180	..on that back wall.
498180	500860	There's just no bloody limpets.
500860	503140	It's like we've eaten them all.
503140	504180	It's warm down there.
504180	505660	Yeah, well, I'm not going down there to get down there.
505660	506660	It's not where you've been for a while.
506660	508180	I'm not risking my life to get a frigging limpet.
508180	509340	No chance.
510860	512940	With limpets few and far between,
512940	516980	the women desperately need to find a protein-rich meal for Georgina.
517980	520020	Get the knife! Get the knife!
520020	522020	What is that? Get the machete!
522980	524020	Where's the machete?
524820	526020	Just get the fucking machete.
526820	529820	Georgia spotted a stingray in the shallows.
534820	536820	Wow! It's fast!
536820	538820	Oh, no chance.
540820	542820	How fast did that move?
542820	544820	That was like lightning fast.
546820	547820	Where did the bottles go?
547820	551820	The miss has cost them a potential 4,000-calorie meal.
551820	555820	We would have had a proper belly food, you know, proper belly food.
555820	559820	As opposed to this much dried coconut every day.
570820	573820	Georgina must once again go to bed hungry.
575820	577820	But she's not the only one who's suffering.
577820	582820	I've got pants as my pillow and smelly socks.
582820	585820	47-year-old Abi has been diagnosed
585820	588820	with back pain since a horse-riding accident in her teens.
588820	590820	Oh, God.
591820	593820	Abi's not happy. She's in pain.
596820	598820	So, I hope she's OK.
601820	605820	Since arriving on the island, she's been sleeping on the hard ground.
605820	608820	I have nowhere comfortable I can go.
608820	611820	Honestly, it's laying down on the floor.
611820	613820	I think my back's absolutely screwed.
615820	617820	It's really hard to explain,
617820	619820	because it's not something you can see.
619820	621820	And it is my health,
621820	624820	and it's not something that anyone can help me with.
624820	626820	I don't want to be a liability to anyone else
626820	629820	and not be able to do the things that I came to do,
629820	631820	which was to help and be a grafter.
641820	643820	So, I've got the scales here.
643820	647820	I've calibrated them and set the dial to zero.
647820	652820	But it's all the women's health that's a concern for Dr Belinda.
652820	656820	After noticing the steep decline in Georgina's physical condition,
656820	659820	she wants to closely monitor the group's weight loss.
659820	661820	Abi!
661820	664820	I used to go to Slimming Club, right, every Monday.
664820	666820	I feel like I'm back there.
666820	671820	If I am ten and a half stone today, I'll be a happy bunny.
671820	676820	£135.
676820	678820	Got my goal.
678820	682820	In 21st-century Britain, we're all obsessed with body image.
682820	684820	But when the pounds are dropping off
684820	686820	because of starvation and malnutrition,
686820	688820	it's a dangerous mindset to have,
688820	692820	and it really is not a cause for celebration.
692820	695820	But you can see your waist is tiny-ton round.
695820	697820	Let me see your tiny little waist.
697820	699820	Aw, look at that little waist.
701820	703820	SHE LAUGHS
706820	708820	George.
708820	709820	You've lost a lot.
709820	711820	You're wasting away, aren't you, sweetheart?
711820	714820	I have to say, I don't find starvation a good way of losing weight.
714820	716820	I don't think we should be celebrating.
716820	719820	I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny.
721820	725820	Georgina has lost a dangerous £21 in weight,
725820	728820	and collectively, the group have lost almost ten stone,
728820	730820	the weight of an entire person.
732820	736820	We're at a critical stage where our bodies have got no food...
738820	741820	..and so can't sustain themselves.
741820	743820	We're not on a diet.
743820	745820	We're starving.
749820	751820	Concerned about their dramatic weight loss,
751820	754820	Georgina calls a group together.
754820	757820	I do feel like I may have nosedived
757820	760820	in terms of food deprivation a lot quicker than the rest of you.
760820	762820	I can see that I've been a lot weaker than the rest of you.
762820	766820	And I really do think that food still needs to be number one priority.
766820	769820	I just don't know how long we can sustain five limpets.
769820	770820	I don't think we can.
770820	772820	I think we're all a little bit in denial
772820	775820	about how critical it is that we start finding food.
779820	783820	The need to find protein for Georgina is now urgent.
785820	787820	With only a few hours of daylight left,
787820	789820	a group led by Lauren are setting traps.
789820	791820	And the hope is snaring a pig.
791820	793820	Nice little track, isn't it?
796820	800820	Unless you're wanting to survive off shredded old pits of coconut
800820	802820	and the old yucca plant,
802820	804820	then it's time to face up to the fact
804820	809820	that I'm going to have to maybe, you know, get a bit brutal.
809820	810820	Are you ready?
810820	811820	Yeah, it works.
811820	812820	Yeah.
820820	822820	Rise and shine, beautiful.
822820	824820	It's a glorious day.
824820	826820	7am.
826820	829820	And the women have endured another bad night's sleep.
836820	838820	Oh, bloody hell.
838820	843820	In pain, 47-year-old Abi confides in her closest friend, Beth.
843820	846820	Every night when I said, this is the time I dread,
846820	848820	I'm so uncomfortable.
848820	851820	Even just turning from my back to my right
851820	853820	is like a knife going into the nerve.
853820	855820	It's like, argh!
855820	857820	I'm now really concerned.
861820	863820	She hasn't really moaned.
863820	865820	One of Abi's problems is that she's worried
865820	867820	that she doesn't like giving up.
867820	869820	She likes to keep going and keep going.
870820	872820	She's such a hard worker.
872820	874820	She's just fucking amazing.
875820	877820	Let's see what's in this sucker.
878820	881820	She's a proper, proper grafter.
881820	883820	And I love that.
883820	886820	But her mind is saying one thing and her body's saying something else
886820	888820	and she's got to listen to her body.
891820	894820	At camp, Abi calls an urgent meeting.
896820	899820	Over the last few days, my back's gone downhill massively
899820	902820	to the point where I'm in a lot of pain
902820	905820	and it's now worse than it's ever been.
905820	907820	I know certain people here,
908820	910820	kind of said, do less.
910820	913820	I wouldn't... I wouldn't be happy doing less.
913820	916820	But the fact is, I have to get off the island
916820	919820	because I'm not helpful to you anymore.
919820	921820	I'm really sorry and I feel like a shit.
926820	928820	I can't... I actually can't believe it.
928820	930820	I'm just completely shocked.
930820	933820	I knew that she was in pain, I knew that she was having back pain,
933820	936820	but it's just happened so fast.
936820	938820	I'm really gutted to see you go
938820	941820	because I think we could have done really well here with you
941820	944820	and I think we'd be a little bit weaker without you.
944820	947820	I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me now
947820	951820	that is completely terrified because there is only ten of us.
951820	954820	Because everything now is going to be completely harder.
954820	956820	And I can't imagine how we're going to get through
956820	958820	and we're going to feed ourselves.
958820	961820	I think hunger's going to become such a problem.
961820	963820	And me pussy mate.
966820	968820	I don't know what I'm going to do.
970820	972820	So sad.
972820	976820	I'm annoyed for her that she had to go because of her back.
976820	982820	And I'm annoyed for me that I'm going to have to stay out here.
984820	986820	But we just got on really well
986820	988820	and it was just really nice to know that she was there.
991820	992820	Bye.
992820	994820	I miss you already, come back!
997820	1000820	I don't know about you, but I feel thoroughly fed up.
1001820	1002820	Yeah.
1002820	1004820	I feel as a group, get smaller and smaller,
1004820	1006820	you're like, how are we meant to do this?
1006820	1007820	Exactly.
1007820	1009820	How on earth are we meant to do this?
1009820	1010820	Exactly.
1012820	1013820	Yeah, it's shit.
1014820	1015820	It's really shit.
1018820	1021820	The group has lost Abi, one of their most valued members.
1024820	1025820	Now they'll each have to work
1025820	1029820	even harder to find food for 34-year-old Georgina,
1029820	1031820	who is dangerously weak from starvation.
1034820	1036820	How do I have the patience for that, Lauren?
1036820	1038820	Neither do I, really, but...
1039820	1041820	I really want to eat something.
1042820	1044820	The women haven't caught a single fish
1044820	1047820	since they first stepped foot on the island.
1047820	1050820	They're attempting to set nets for the first time.
1050820	1053820	I'm literally solely focused on getting through the days
1053820	1054820	and getting food.
1054820	1057820	And I'm going to go after it, and I'm going to get it.
1057820	1060820	And I'm going to get it for the other girls as well, you know?
1060820	1062820	I feel sorry for George,
1062820	1065820	because he's just been absolutely nailed by illness,
1065820	1068820	and so failure is not an option.
1068820	1069820	Whoa!
1070820	1072820	That's not even stable at all.
1074820	1075820	Hello!
1076820	1079820	On a desert island, one of your best sources of food
1079820	1081820	is obviously going to come from the sea,
1081820	1083820	but none of the women are able to do that.
1083820	1085820	None of the women are experienced at sea fishing,
1085820	1088820	so the reality is it's going to take them hours and hours
1088820	1090820	of painstaking trial and error,
1090820	1093820	being patient if they're going to hone their skills.
1093820	1097820	It's as sturdy as we're going to get it.
1097820	1099820	Who knows? Could be fish tonight.
1106820	1110820	It's now 12 hours since Lauren and the group set the nets.
1110820	1112820	I'm hoping that we've got about ten fish in our net.
1113820	1116820	Come on, net. Do us good. Do us good.
1116820	1119820	Their last hope of feeding Georgina tonight
1119820	1121820	rests on a decent haul.
1121820	1123820	There's one of our floats.
1124820	1126820	Is the net here? Is it?
1130820	1132820	Is there a fish in it? No.
1134820	1136820	Ah! Bastard.
1137820	1139820	That's such a shame.
1140820	1143820	I don't know if we'll ever be able to untangle that net.
1143820	1145820	No, we're not.
1146820	1148820	How the fuck are we going to catch fish?
1157820	1160820	I feel pathetic today. No.
1160820	1164820	Honestly, I haven't been able to function at all today.
1164820	1167820	With no fish and Georgina's health hanging in the balance,
1167820	1170820	it's a race against time to find food.
1170820	1173820	To make sure these women have a fighting chance of survival,
1173820	1176820	I've made sure that the island's got enough water,
1176820	1179820	indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive,
1179820	1184820	but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it.
1186820	1188820	Fingers crossed.
1188820	1191820	Yesterday, Lauren and Beth set animal traps
1191820	1193820	in the island's jungle interior.
1193820	1196820	They're going back to see if they've been successful.
1197820	1201820	Something has eaten the bait but not set off the trap.
1203820	1205820	Got the knife.
1205820	1208820	It's not a game and it's a long time without food
1208820	1210820	and we can't survive without food.
1210820	1213820	I think it's about time that, you know,
1213820	1216820	we get out there and start hunting some animals.
1217820	1220820	One of my main things that's pushing me for this challenge
1220820	1222820	is finding out who I am.
1222820	1225820	Can I survive? Can I hunt for my own food?
1225820	1227820	We don't do that nowadays.
1227820	1229820	Super cheesy lasagne.
1229820	1230820	Cheesy dip.
1230820	1232820	Johnson cheesy dip.
1233820	1236820	Just think it's getting back to our animalistic roots
1236820	1239820	and what happens if you have to go hunting for it,
1239820	1243820	kill it yourself, skin it or whatever, and then cook it.
1247820	1249820	It's been set off.
1249820	1251820	It has.
1251820	1253820	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1259820	1262820	They've caught a pig by its leg in one of their traps.
1262820	1264820	Fuck!
1264820	1266820	That is one huge pig.
1266820	1268820	I can't believe that.
1268820	1271820	Before killing it, Lauren and Beth decide to return to camp
1271820	1273820	to plan and prepare their tools.
1273820	1276820	Oh, my God, we're going to eat tonight. I know.
1276820	1278820	Like we've never eaten before.
1278820	1280820	Yay!
1280820	1282820	Georgie, we've caught one.
1282820	1284820	We've caught a pig.
1284820	1286820	You are kidding me. No.
1286820	1288820	Because there's a pig in the trap.
1288820	1290820	We literally walked in and heard this noise.
1290820	1291820	It's right there. Yeah.
1291820	1293820	Oh, my God.
1293820	1294820	Oh, my God.
1294820	1295820	Oh, my God.
1299820	1300820	Everybody needs that food,
1300820	1303820	but I recognise that I really need that food.
1303820	1305820	It's a little bit of a mental feeling.
1305820	1308820	And who knew that a pig in a snare would...
1310820	1312820	..would feel like such an emotional thing?
1315820	1319820	We're just going to have to absolutely throw our bodies at it.
1319820	1320820	Don't look at it in the eye.
1320820	1322820	Don't have your eyes wide and looking at it,
1322820	1324820	so don't show any of your teeth.
1324820	1326820	Approach it really quietly. OK.
1326820	1328820	And so, once we've got it on the ground,
1328820	1330820	you need to tie its hooves together
1330820	1332820	and we're also letting loose its neck,
1332820	1334820	so someone will have to be pulling on its neck.
1334820	1337820	Does anyone else want to kill the pig?
1337820	1339820	I don't feel confident that I could.
1339820	1340820	I don't know enough.
1340820	1344820	If you need help at any stage, I'm more than happy to help.
1344820	1346820	Yeah. OK.
1346820	1348820	At the minute, I'm the only one in the house
1348820	1350820	at the minute, I'm the only one in the group
1350820	1352820	that could actually physically kill an animal
1352820	1354820	because no-one else wants to do it.
1354820	1357820	And so I feel that's a responsibility as well.
1357820	1360820	I don't see them as an animal any more,
1360820	1363820	which is so strange for me.
1363820	1364820	I love animals to pieces,
1364820	1367820	but I just feel completely detached from that now.
1371820	1372820	It's been over an hour
1372820	1375820	since Lauren and Beth found the pig in the trap.
1376820	1378820	A decisive kill is in store.
1378820	1381820	It is now crucial to the whole group.
1381820	1383820	I'm going to go for the head.
1383820	1384820	Then I'm going to go for the legs.
1384820	1385820	I'm ready to go.
1385820	1386820	So come in with your hooves,
1386820	1388820	and I'm going to go with the side of the leg.
1388820	1390820	So you've got it.
1390820	1391820	Get in.
1401820	1403820	Someone grab this.
1403820	1404820	Come round this side.
1404820	1406820	Beth, come round this side.
1406820	1407820	The trap.
1409820	1410820	OK, right.
1410820	1411820	Make some moves.
1413820	1414820	Hang on.
1414820	1415820	Right.
1415820	1416820	OK, Beth.
1416820	1417820	Step.
1417820	1418820	Beth.
1424820	1425820	Try and...
1430820	1431820	Fuck.
1435820	1436820	Fuck's sake.
1438820	1442820	That's...
1442820	1444820	That's so frustrating.
1445820	1446820	We lived and learned on that one.
1446820	1448820	I think that you need to get on him quicker.
1449820	1451820	I feel like I fucked that one up.
1451820	1452820	Damn it.
1452820	1453820	Damn it.
1453820	1454820	Could have bloody...
1454820	1456820	And now I feel like we've let down everybody else.
1456820	1458820	You know, the ones waiting at camp, thinking,
1458820	1460820	oh, they've got a pig and they're eating tonight.
1460820	1462820	And George isn't very well.
1462820	1463820	She's being sick.
1463820	1464820	So...
1466820	1467820	Yeah.
1467820	1468820	Nice.
1468820	1469820	Good.
1469820	1470820	Good.
1470820	1471820	All right.
1471820	1472820	How much we got?
1472820	1473820	Not enough.
1473820	1474820	Could do with a bit more of everything.
1474820	1475820	Maybe around the next bit.
1475820	1476820	But I think we've exhausted this little section.
1476820	1487820	With the hunter failure, Georgina has no choice but to join Georgie and Becky on another
1487820	1488820	bleak search for shellfish.
1488820	1489820	It's so hot, isn't it?
1489820	1490820	Yeah.
1490820	1491820	It's really humid.
1491820	1492820	Really hot.
1492820	1493820	Already weak from malnutrition, the effort is further depleting Georgina's dainties.
1493820	1494820	Yeah.
1494820	1495820	We've got a little bit of everything.
1495820	1496820	There's some more.
1496820	1499820	creating Georgina's dangerously low reserves.
1501820	1505820	The function of my being is struggling.
1507820	1511820	I feel like the switch has been turned off every time I stand up.
1515820	1517820	I don't know what to do about it, either.
1517820	1521820	It's like a vicious circle. You need the energy to get the food.
1521820	1524820	But you haven't got the energy without the food.
1527820	1530820	I honestly don't know where these girls are getting their energy from.
1531820	1533820	Swim time! It certainly is.
1534820	1536820	Let's go for a swim, babe. Yeah.
1536820	1539820	I'm just really worried about how weak I am.
1539820	1542820	I just don't want to be the person who's, like, a dead weight.
1542820	1545820	You're not going to be. And you're not going to be.
1545820	1548820	But I feel like I am. It's just so not like me.
1548820	1551820	I don't know if I'm going to be the person I want to be.
1551820	1553820	Honestly, it's like the lights have gone off,
1553820	1555820	and it's really...
1556820	1558820	..it's really quite alarming.
1563820	1565820	Listen, you are not... Thank you.
1565820	1568820	Listen, you are not leaving this island, right?
1568820	1570820	For one, listen to me. But I do.
1570820	1574820	Listen, you are not leaving this island to the fucking end game, right?
1574820	1579820	I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back, and nor does she.
1579820	1581820	And you would. And I would. Totally. And I would.
1581820	1582820	I would.
1586820	1589820	I'm really, really worried about Georgia Kay.
1589820	1592820	Literally, I'm watching her deteriorate before my eyes.
1592820	1595820	She's not eating the yucca, she's not very keen on the limpets,
1595820	1598820	and I'm just really worried she's not going to make it, to be honest.
1598820	1602820	The one thing we need for George is food.
1602820	1606820	Who knows? Maybe we can get one more island miracle
1606820	1610820	and turn George's fate around, which would be amazing.
1611820	1616820	So far, all the women's attempts
1616820	1619820	at hunting and fishing on the island have failed.
1619820	1622820	Oh, look! Like pot noodle. Yeah.
1622820	1625820	Desperately hungry, they've resorted to scavenging
1625820	1627820	for nourishment on the beach.
1627820	1629820	Budweiser!
1629820	1631820	Full of sea water.
1636820	1638820	What's that? Some perfume.
1638820	1640820	Men's perfume. It's like that.
1641820	1644820	Oh, now I'm getting horny!
1646820	1649820	Oh, first time I've thought about a man.
1649820	1651820	Jamie could hump this smell.
1651820	1654820	Maybe if you wear that, I might start humping you. Oh, gosh.
1657820	1661820	The women have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet for weeks,
1661820	1665820	and the health of one of the group is causing grave concern.
1665820	1667820	I'm really worried about George.
1667820	1670820	She sleeps all the time, she's been sick.
1670820	1673820	She's just not well.
1673820	1676820	I don't know whether she's going to last.
1676820	1679820	Who are we going to talk about food with?
1683820	1686820	We can't afford to lose anyone else in this group.
1688820	1692820	One rich source of food on the island is its bird life.
1692820	1696820	Catching one of the island's larger birds could mean 2,000 calories
1696820	1698820	to share with Georgina.
1699820	1702820	Now, I have no idea if this will work.
1702820	1704820	We can only try.
1705820	1708820	Psychotherapist Havilah has fashioned a bird trap
1708820	1711820	out of a stick, some string and a coconut.
1712820	1715820	I'm going to put my trap in here.
1715820	1717820	This is quite good territory.
1717820	1719820	Birds are often flocking here.
1719820	1722820	We don't want to get nice, pretty birds.
1723820	1727820	But to lure her prey, she's going to need bait.
1728820	1730820	Oh, there's a hermit crab.
1730820	1732820	I don't want to do this.
1734820	1736820	Not very good at machetes.
1739820	1740820	Hello, beautiful.
1740820	1742820	Go on, go to Daddy.
1742820	1743820	One, two, three.
1743820	1746820	My dad has been a pigeon racer from a young age,
1746820	1748820	so I understand birds.
1748820	1751820	I know how to handle them, I know what to do.
1751820	1753820	And if it comes to it...
1753820	1755820	I'll kill one.
1755820	1757820	No, no, no, no, no.
1757820	1759820	I wouldn't take any pleasure from it.
1759820	1761820	I don't really want to kill anything,
1761820	1763820	but I could if I'm hungry.
1765820	1768820	In those situations, what needs to be done needs to be done.
1776820	1778820	Yeah, I've done it, so I've killed it.
1782820	1785820	Havilah will need to return in the morning.
1786820	1790820	So dinner tonight will be once again a handful of limpets...
1791820	1793820	..at around seven calories a pop.
1793820	1796820	So I think we've got five each, I think.
1796820	1798820	I don't know if you want to count them up.
1798820	1799820	Whoa!
1799820	1800820	Wow!
1800820	1802820	Pop that in your mouth.
1803820	1804820	Thank you, big horse.
1804820	1805820	Well done.
1807820	1809820	It's like a lollipop, I can't believe it.
1809820	1811820	I know what it's like, and it's not a lollipop.
1811820	1813820	From here, it looks like a bellend.
1813820	1814820	Oh!
1815820	1817820	This tastes like her boyfriend's ball.
1819820	1821820	How I would imagine testicles taste.
1823820	1827820	And those limpets, bloody hell, oh, my God.
1827820	1829820	It reminded me of...
1829820	1833820	..if I was to put my boyfriend's testicle in my mouth
1833820	1835820	and take a bite...
1836820	1838820	..like, a rubbery consistency
1838820	1841820	and then a pop of, like, juice and goo,
1841820	1844820	and, oh, my God, I now can't get that image out of my head.
1845820	1848820	It makes me get thinking about it.
1848820	1850820	By the way, she's never teabagged him.
1850820	1852820	What does teabagging mean?
1854820	1857820	Who's going to explain that one?
1857820	1859820	Put the testicles in your mouth.
1859820	1860820	Why?
1860820	1862820	Why not?
1865820	1867820	Oh, Gillian, you dirty bitch.
1867820	1869820	Classy.
1869820	1871820	WHISTLE BLOWS
1871820	1873820	WHISTLE BLOWS
1873820	1875820	WHISTLE BLOWS
1877820	1880820	Another day, and once again, no breakfast.
1882820	1884820	Who'd like some pancakes and bacon?
1884820	1886820	Oh, damn.
1888820	1891820	Pancakes, bacon, maple syrup...
1892820	1893820	..stack.
1897820	1899820	George, can I get you anything?
1899820	1902820	Ravaged by hunger, Georgina is too frail to leave camp.
1903820	1904820	I'm absolutely floored
1904820	1906820	by what I can only presume is malnutrition.
1906820	1908820	I don't want to be the one who's ill or sickly
1908820	1910820	because I'm not that person at home.
1910820	1912820	There's enough people who need feeding and drinking
1912820	1914820	without just having a dead weight to carry.
1915820	1916820	OK, so...
1918820	1920820	..not nice, but if there is a birdie there,
1920820	1922820	you need to take a knife.
1922820	1924820	Havilah's bird tracking team
1924820	1926820	is now looking for the birdie.
1926820	1928820	They're looking for the birdie.
1928820	1930820	They're looking for the birdie.
1930820	1932820	They're looking for the birdie.
1932820	1934820	Havilah's bird trap, if successful,
1934820	1936820	could provide a much-needed meal.
1937820	1939820	Have you killed birds before age?
1939820	1941820	Yeah, but I don't like doing it.
1943820	1945820	It kind of was enforced on me as a child.
1952820	1954820	Insects have eaten my bait.
1956820	1958820	Trial and error, Georgie, trial and error.
1959820	1961820	But I need to go away and rethink it.
1962820	1965820	I think we are actually starving, you know?
1965820	1967820	You never sit at home and think,
1967820	1970820	oh, I'll just have one limb pit today,
1970820	1972820	or I won't eat today.
1972820	1974820	I'll eat in three weeks.
1974820	1976820	It just doesn't happen.
1978820	1980820	With Havilah's bird trap a failure,
1980820	1983820	there's no choice but to venture back into the jungle.
1983820	1986820	We're going to set some pig traps
1986820	1989820	so we can get some pigs.
1989820	1991820	What's your favourite type of pork?
1991820	1994820	I think it's got to be pulled pork, but done right.
1995820	1998820	Having come so close to making a kill 24 hours ago,
1998820	2002820	Laura and Beth and Belinda are back on the trail of the pig.
2003820	2006820	Let's try and find some tracks and trap it up.
2006820	2010820	It could be their only hope of keeping Georgina on the island.
2010820	2012820	Here's the dead-eaten crab, isn't it?
2012820	2013820	Mm-hm.
2013820	2015820	It's been here snuffling.
2015820	2019820	Stop on that branch right in front of you, darling.
2019820	2020820	There's a massive bird.
2020820	2022820	There's a massive boa.
2022820	2024820	See this branch here?
2024820	2026820	Look, at the top.
2026820	2028820	Wow.
2028820	2029820	Shall we try and catch it?
2029820	2031820	Yes.
2031820	2033820	I'm happy to go for him.
2033820	2036820	The boa constrictor snake is a formidable foe.
2036820	2040820	This guy will kill its prey by biting, grabbing,
2040820	2043820	then rapping and suffocating,
2043820	2045820	and then will swallow it whole.
2045820	2048820	They're very fast, they can strike half their body length,
2048820	2050820	and you do not want to get hurt.
2050820	2053820	You want to get a snake bite in a survival situation.
2053820	2054820	You see him?
2054820	2057820	I think he's gone, actually, inside, going down,
2057820	2059820	so he's probably going to come out in a minute.
2062820	2064820	Well, he's out. He's coming down!
2064820	2065820	He's out.
2065820	2067820	OK, now he's in striking mode.
2067820	2070820	The way to kill it is to pin its head.
2070820	2073820	If you control the head, you control the body,
2073820	2076820	and then either stave its head in with a rock
2076820	2078820	or cut its head off with a machete.
2078820	2079820	But if you can catch them,
2079820	2081820	this is great survival food.
2081820	2084820	Look at all the meat on this guy.
2085820	2086820	Whoa!
2086820	2088820	Right, there we go. There's your...
2090820	2092820	Well done, Bish. Got him.
2092820	2094820	Well done, well done, well done.
2096820	2097820	I didn't get him.
2097820	2098820	I didn't get him, I didn't get him.
2098820	2099820	Oh, she didn't, she didn't.
2099820	2101820	Man, you can even just do a machete on him.
2103820	2104820	Hold.
2104820	2105820	No.
2107820	2108820	Hold.
2108820	2110820	Good, good one, good one.
2110820	2112820	Well done, well done, well done.
2114820	2117820	OK, well done, guys. Well done, well done.
2117820	2119820	High five!
2119820	2120820	Yeah!
2120820	2125820	We seized the opportunity and just went and did it.
2125820	2128820	Oh, wow. Sorry, Mr Snake.
2128820	2131820	Snake starters followed by limpets and snails.
2131820	2134820	This is really going to lift the spirits on camp,
2134820	2136820	which is great.
2136820	2137820	Let's go home.
2138820	2140820	I wonder when on our jungle trekking days
2140820	2144820	how many things we went past without knowing.
2147820	2148820	Guys?
2148820	2149820	Yeah?
2149820	2150820	Guys?
2150820	2152820	Come back here really fucking slowly.
2152820	2153820	Where are you?
2153820	2155820	Shh!
2155820	2156820	Don't shout.
2156820	2157820	There, there, there, there, there.
2157820	2158820	There.
2158820	2159820	You see it?
2159820	2160820	Oh, yeah.
2160820	2161820	A pig.
2162820	2165820	Fucking hell.
2168820	2170820	Is it dead?
2170820	2171820	It's not dead.
2171820	2173820	It's just closed its eyes.
2173820	2174820	Here's the thing.
2174820	2176820	Do we jump it now?
2176820	2177820	Yep.
2177820	2179820	I don't know.
2179820	2181820	It seems like too much of a gift from the gods.
2181820	2182820	I'm not going to do it.
2182820	2184820	He's right here.
2184820	2186820	Basically, it's me.
2186820	2188820	I'm going to go for the head.
2188820	2190820	I'm going to go for the trunk.
2190820	2194820	Right now, I'm trying to get the noose around his neck.
2194820	2196820	They're going to come in straight out
2196820	2199820	and tie his face together.
2199820	2205820	If they need it, smack with a rock in front of them.
2205820	2207820	We can't always stay in.
2207820	2209820	We don't have the fucking game room.
2209820	2210820	We're strong.
2210820	2211820	We're big.
2211820	2212820	We're clean.
2212820	2213820	We're good.
2213820	2215820	I'm not going to think about it.
2215820	2216820	Yeah, of course.
2216820	2217820	Yeah.
2226820	2239820	We can't always stay in.
2239820	2241820	We don't have the fucking game room.
2241820	2243820	A hunting party led by Lauren
2243820	2245820	has stumbled across a sleeping pig
2245820	2247820	in the middle of the jungle.
2249820	2252820	It could offer salvation for Georgina,
2252820	2254820	who's desperately malnourished.
2254820	2255820	The law of the jungle
2255820	2257820	really is rooted in opportunity,
2257820	2259820	and you've got to take your chances when you can.
2259820	2262820	The women need to learn from passing decisions.
2262820	2264820	Just seize the moment.
2264820	2265820	The stakes are high.
2265820	2266820	If they fail,
2266820	2269820	the group are going to slide further into starvation.
2271820	2272820	Are we committed?
2272820	2273820	Yeah.
2273820	2274820	100%?
2274820	2275820	Yeah.
2275820	2276820	100%?
2276820	2277820	Yeah.
2277820	2278820	OK.
2278820	2279820	This time, they're prepared
2279820	2281820	and have sharp weapons for the kill.
2285820	2286820	OK.
2286820	2287820	Let's go.
2287820	2288820	Let's go.
2288820	2290820	Let's go.
2290820	2292820	Let's go.
2292820	2293820	Let's go.
2293820	2294820	Let's go.
2294820	2295820	All right.
2295820	2296820	OK.
2296820	2297820	All right.
2297820	2298820	All right.
2298820	2299820	All right.
2299820	2300820	OK.
2300820	2301820	Wait a minute.
2301820	2302820	I've got to get my hand to the door.
2302820	2303820	OK.
2303820	2304820	All right.
2304820	2305820	OK.
2305820	2306820	Wait.
2306820	2307820	Let's go.
2307820	2308820	Yeah.
2308820	2309820	What are we going to do?
2309820	2310820	Let's go.
2310820	2311820	We're going to take your chance.
2311820	2312820	OK.
2312820	2313820	Whatever.
2313820	2314820	All right.
2314820	2344220	Okay, everyone? Everyone okay?
2344220	2346900	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. You okay, Beth?
2346900	2348900	Yeah.
2348900	2351220	Okay, I'm just gonna put the knife to the side, out of the way.
2351220	2354220	And we'll just wait. We'll just wait.
2354220	2356220	Oh, gosh, that's horrible.
2356220	2358220	You're amazing, Laura.
2361220	2363220	It's amazing what that looks like.
2363220	2366220	It's fucked up.
2366220	2368220	I don't know why I'm laughing. It's nerves.
2368220	2370220	It's complete adrenaline.
2370220	2373220	Oh, wow.
2375220	2377220	Good work, team.
2377220	2379220	It's quite amazing, wasn't it, really?
2379220	2381220	I'll never forget this.
2381220	2383220	What a day.
2387220	2391220	That's the most intense thing
2391220	2397220	that has ever fucking happened to me in my entire life.
2397220	2400220	It was something that was almost caveman-like.
2400220	2403220	We just sort of behaved in this really uniform way
2403220	2406220	that I never thought that I had in me.
2406220	2408220	Whoa!
2410220	2413220	And now we're gonna eat every single morsel,
2413220	2417220	not let one ounce of that little piggy go to waste.
2417220	2419220	H, we caught the pig.
2419220	2421220	Are you kidding? No.
2421220	2423220	That's what that is over there.
2423220	2425220	Are you kidding? I'm not fucking kidding.
2425220	2428220	Oh, my God, mind blown. I don't know what to say.
2428220	2430220	Thank you. Thank you!
2430220	2432220	Oh, my God, I'm gonna have...
2432220	2434220	Oh!
2434220	2436220	I'm so excited!
2438220	2440220	Jeez, Louise!
2440220	2442220	Yep.
2442220	2444220	And, Harvey, we have a starter.
2444220	2448220	Oh, my God, I've just seen it in that bucket.
2448220	2450220	Starters and me.
2450220	2453220	Do you know what? You guys, you're just more of a woman
2453220	2455220	than I'll ever be, all of you.
2455220	2458220	Did you hear, George? Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
2458220	2460220	Shit.
2460220	2461220	And...
2461220	2463220	My adrenaline is, like, through the roof.
2463220	2465220	Does it really get quite in the trap?
2465220	2467220	No, I was fast asleep and jumped it. Never.
2467220	2469220	Oh, my God.
2469220	2473220	For 34-year-old Georgina, the pig means more than just dinner.
2475220	2477220	Bloody hell, it's massive.
2477220	2480220	I'm just so made up. We've got food.
2481220	2483220	Oh, crap, I'm so happy.
2485220	2489220	I can't tell you the feeling of absolute relief
2489220	2493220	that's just run through my entire body
2493220	2497220	at the thought of having some food.
2497220	2500220	Lauren and Beth obviously do an incredible job.
2500220	2502220	I just can't believe it.
2504220	2506220	I could not have done that two and a half, three weeks ago.
2506220	2509220	If you'd have put me on the island and I'd have seen that ball,
2509220	2512220	I would have done my absolute most to stay away from it.
2512220	2514220	But I'm hungry now,
2514220	2518220	and my mind is not the same mind.
2518220	2520220	As it was three weeks ago.
2522220	2525220	The fire's all toasting, ready for it.
2525220	2530220	Even the vegetarian in the group, Jamie, is relieved for Georgina.
2530220	2533220	I love it. It's brilliant.
2543220	2546220	They have big legs on that thing, aren't they?
2546220	2547220	Lots of big legs.
2547220	2550220	I'm going to be on the bottom of me tonight.
2551220	2555220	The women will now have to butcher, skin and carve their kill.
2555220	2557220	It's not pleasant.
2557220	2559220	Dead pig smells.
2559220	2562220	Inside, I'm like...
2562220	2564220	You're going to be sick.
2564220	2566220	I've got to do it to survive.
2566220	2567220	Oh, dear.
2567220	2569220	A little bit of shit came out.
2570220	2572220	I'm starving, are you?
2578220	2583220	The pig will provide the women with roughly 50,000 calories.
2583220	2586220	Some fat, if anyone wants some fat.
2590220	2593220	For the first time, they have more food
2593220	2595220	than they can possibly eat in one sitting.
2595220	2597220	How is it, George?
2597220	2599220	Warm.
2599220	2602220	We have not eaten like this for, like, over three weeks,
2602220	2605220	and, my God, it's been a long time coming.
2605220	2607220	Could you buy that in a restaurant?
2607220	2609220	That fresh, that's rib.
2609220	2612220	Let's literally get the meat in my mouth now
2612220	2614220	and don't take it away.
2614220	2616220	Mmm.
2616220	2620220	Harvey, I can see you eating that with your eyes closed.
2623220	2625220	Are you having an orgasm while you're eating it?
2625220	2628220	Do you know what? I've never experienced this in my life.
2628220	2630220	I feel like a savage.
2630220	2634220	I've had so little calories in me every day,
2634220	2639220	and this pig may be my salvation.
2639220	2641220	You're going to turn it round now.
2641220	2643220	This will help you.
2643220	2646220	I've been rescued by the pig hunters.
2646220	2649220	My mother would be appalled if she saw me eating like this.
2650220	2652220	Sorry, Mum.
2652220	2655220	The pork's providing the women with a valuable source
2655220	2658220	of protein, fat, vitamins, minerals,
2658220	2661220	but more importantly, it's giving them what I call
2661220	2663220	the golden window of opportunity.
2663220	2666220	The women have about three days to capitalise on that win.
2666220	2669220	This is their chance to improve their quality of life
2669220	2672220	and use that energy to regroup and hunt again.
2672220	2674220	Hello, Mr Snake.
2674220	2676220	Hello, Mr Snake.
2676220	2677220	Look at that.
2677220	2679220	Now for the second course.
2679220	2681220	How are you feeling, Hobbs? Do you want to do it?
2681220	2683220	I'm going to do it. Go for it.
2683220	2685220	And despite her screamishness,
2685220	2687220	Havilah has volunteered to skin the snake.
2687220	2689220	Oh, look at that.
2689220	2691220	It's his oesophagus.
2691220	2692220	What it is?
2692220	2696220	I love to stuff a turkey at Christmas,
2696220	2698220	and it means you've got to get in the skin.
2698220	2700220	Ready? Like a sock.
2700220	2702220	Come on. Ready? There we go.
2702220	2704220	Wow. So, yeah, go very slow.
2704220	2706220	Yeah, got it.
2706220	2708220	Amazing.
2708220	2711220	I've just skinned a boa constrictor.
2711220	2714220	I'd never do that in my real life.
2714220	2717220	Well done. Not many girls could do that, you know.
2717220	2719220	Yeah. Not many.
2719220	2721220	And if anybody judges any of the girls,
2721220	2723220	here, for what they've done today,
2723220	2725220	they can fuck off.
2727220	2730220	I've been able to help everyone today,
2730220	2733220	and I'm really proud of that.
2733220	2735220	An incredible day.
2735220	2737220	Emotionally draining.
2737220	2740220	But the end result is that we have food,
2740220	2744220	and we'll be able to keep going for that bit longer.
2744220	2747220	Next time on The Women's Island...
2747220	2749220	Oh, my God!
2749220	2751220	That is the biggest shocker I've ever seen.
2751220	2753220	People are not prioritising the water,
2753220	2755220	and it's pissing me off.
2755220	2757220	The group is completely on their arse.
2757220	2759220	Julie! Julie!
2759220	2761220	I'm so weak.
2762220	2764220	We're going to have to pull the plug on this,
2764220	2767220	and I've got to think about removing you all from the island.
2777220	2779220	Boy, I love your skill.
2779220	2780220	Fine, let's have some tea on that.
2780220	2782220	Let's have some food but only at the hotel.
2782220	2783220	Thank you.
2783220	2784220	Oh, my God.
2784220	2787220	This is insane, really Rosa.
2787220	2788220	All right, everybody.
2788220	2789220	There it is.
2789220	2790220	I like it.
2790220	2792220	You're on theου
2792220	2793220	I like it.
2793220	2794220	Oh, wow.
2794220	2795220	Oh, wow.
2795220	2796220	Seriously.
2796220	2797220	I'm so killing it.
2797220	2800220	Irene, I want to go to the pool to see if my pod is cleaned up.
2800220	2802220	Well, I think we should go.
2802220	2804220	We were playing a game
2804220	2805220	and the only thing we were able to do
2805220	2806220	was bring Universal Neoер.
