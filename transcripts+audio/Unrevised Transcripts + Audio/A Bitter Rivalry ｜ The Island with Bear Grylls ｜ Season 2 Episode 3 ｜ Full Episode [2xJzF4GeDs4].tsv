0	14640	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14640	22760	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be
22760	30620	utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything
30620	38400	themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental
38400	48600	strength the winds a day prehistoric animal who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we
48600	49620	follow the men's on
52760	59060	this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever
59060	68000	they'll have to endure the height and harsh tropical storm season nature I say this is
68000	74400	the worst you can do they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food
74400	82700	you lazy bunch of bone idle have these Monday men
82700	82740	and hunt for their own food you lazy bunch of bone idle bastards have these Monday men
82740	84740	got what it takes to survive
84740	93480	that's the artistry
93480	108540	four days ago I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote Pacific Island
108540	118420	they're beaten next to nothing limpets horrendous and up three days a brutal
118420	124020	tropical storm the group began to fracture what is the matter with you
124020	127980	nothing a matter with me so leaving three people threatening to walk off the
127980	133540	island I cannot face another day on you I'm not gonna make the rest of the time
133540	138480	I've been having a lot of until I heard one of my teammate so they wanted me to
138480	140480	It's just being a prick.
144480	147480	Bollocks, absolute bollocks. I'm not having it.
147480	149480	I am going off this island
149480	153480	because I'm not being held responsible for that.
153480	156480	22-year-old graphic designer Joe, builder Andy
156480	158480	and now construction manager Paul
158480	161480	are all threatening to leave the island.
162480	165480	It's affected you more than I thought it would have.
165480	167480	I came here to get away from shit like this,
167480	169480	not deal with it every day.
169480	172480	So we are three men down in one day
172480	175480	when the odds are against us at the moment,
175480	178480	and without a full complement of people,
178480	180480	we're going to really struggle.
180480	185480	You just made this survival thing probably twice as hard.
185480	187480	OK, slightly less practically, guys.
187480	190480	We've stood here and talked for an hour.
190480	192480	If it really is going to be 11 of us today,
192480	194480	us 11 have got a lot of work to do
194480	196480	to get through the rest of the day,
196480	197480	so if you guys are not prepared
197480	199480	to commit to the rest of the group,
199480	200480	boom, go.
200480	202480	Sweet.
202480	204480	I've made a decision. I've had enough.
204480	206480	I want to go now.
206480	208480	Basically, we've realised that a candlelit dinner
208480	211480	and a glass of wine is a bit better than being here.
213480	215480	Look, we knew it was never going to be easy,
215480	218480	but it's not the survival bit that's got to me.
218480	220480	It's just all bullshit.
220480	222480	I think that's genuinely shitty.
222480	224480	I think that's walking away and leaving the rest of us
224480	226480	and letting the rest of us die in a big way.
226480	228480	Not only is it a selfish thing to do,
228480	230480	I think it's the most selfish possible time you could go
230480	232480	when, like, all hands are needed.
234480	237480	With Paul having made a definitive decision to go,
237480	240480	the group are hoping that other builder, Andy,
240480	242480	will now change his mind about leaving.
242480	244480	Don't leave because of someone else.
244480	247480	If he's gone anyway, stay and get amongst it.
247480	248480	How can I possibly stay, man,
248480	250480	when a guy was leaving because of me?
250480	252480	If you had left, he would have still gone.
252480	254480	Andy, if you stay, you can accomplish six things at a time
254480	255480	instead of five.
256480	257480	You'll just be a jerk.
257480	258480	I'll stay.
258480	259480	I'll stay.
259480	260480	I'll stay.
260480	261480	I'll stay.
261480	262480	I'll stay.
262480	263480	That's nice.
263480	264480	Awesome.
264480	265480	Well done, Andy.
265480	266480	I'll stay.
266480	267480	Yeah!
267480	268480	APPLAUSE
268480	269480	Good boy, Andy.
269480	270480	That was a good boy, Andy.
270480	271480	That's really...
271480	272480	I'm really pleased about that.
272480	273480	It's less worry.
273480	275480	And it's a heartache to see the others go,
275480	276480	but you know what?
276480	277480	We're stronger.
277480	279480	We're stronger with 12 and 11.

286480	290400	As the weather breaks, Paul uses the emergency satellite phone
290400	293200	to request his evacuation, along with Joe.
294660	298540	This is Paul. I would like to come off of the island.
298800	300860	It's either me or one of the others go,
301500	304260	and I don't want me to be used as a scapegoat,
304440	308020	so I believe I am stronger than that person
308020	310280	and wouldn't regret this decision.
311000	313160	It's going to make everything so much harder.
313640	315900	We've not been here for five minutes, really.
316960	319040	And we're losing two members of the team.
320300	321260	I'm a happy man.
322260	324960	I want to be a happy man with a tub of Pringles and a Mars bar.
325540	327000	You can only encourage them so much
327000	329560	before you end up spending a third of your day
329560	330880	encouraging somebody not to leave.
331500	334400	That could be better spent time getting the things we need.
334840	337000	Water, fire, shelter, food.
338920	340560	Having lost valuable time,
340560	342900	the priority for the 12 remaining men
342900	345800	is to finish a shelter before another storm hits.
346480	347860	We are running on empty,
347860	350580	but we are being stubborn and persistent.
350580	355180	Fortunately, Andy decided to change his mind about leaving.
355180	357540	At this point, there's still so much to do.
357540	360040	We need all hands on deck,
360040	362780	so losing three people would have been a massive blow.
364160	365480	Right, Piers, I'm off.
365480	366940	You're off, mate.
366940	367820	Well done, mate.
367820	368740	See you again, eh?
368740	370500	Yeah, see you, Ben and Blasey.
371900	372940	We're looking to go.
374620	376260	I'd turn round and shake your hand, mate,
376260	377260	but we're...
377260	378260	No, it's fine.
378260	379260	Yeah, I'll...
379260	380260	We're sort of structurally integral at the moment.
380260	381260	See you later.
381260	382260	I don't want to spoil fun, gents,
382260	385260	but is there any possibility you could step out of the area
385260	387260	while we just start running these struts across?
387260	390260	Continue your conversation just sort of ten feet over there.
396260	397260	Andy!
402260	405260	He didn't even acknowledge me.
405260	406260	Did he not? No.
406260	408260	I didn't even turn around and say,
408260	409260	''Dicky bird.''
409260	410260	Unbelievable.
410260	411260	Spineless wonders.
411260	413260	Fucking hell, lads, what were you thinking?
413260	416260	What were you possibly thinking?
416260	418260	Just before we came out here, I bought a brand of golf.
418260	420260	Mate, it's wild.
420260	421260	Oh, it's beautiful.
421260	423260	500-pound wheels.
423260	425260	Lovely view, though, innit?
426260	431260	After just five days on the island, 14 men are down to 12.
434260	435260	It was a bit emotional,
435260	436260	saying goodbye to everyone.
436260	437260	Yeah, of course it was.
437260	438260	But...
438260	439260	I mean, in a short time we've been here,
439260	440260	it would make quite a strong bond, but...
440260	442260	Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.
442260	444260	Now the dead weight's fucked off, let's get on with it.
444260	445260	Ain't got the time to it.
445260	447260	We've got to build a fucking house for tonight.
447260	449260	When people leave a survival group,
449260	451260	the positive thing is that what it does,
451260	453260	it galvanises those that remain,
453260	456260	making them even more determined that they can survive.
456260	458260	The new group may be less in number,
458260	461260	but it will be greater in strength.
461260	464260	No, genuinely, I can't believe that after five days
464260	465260	we're down to 12 people.
465260	467260	It is a shock, innit? Come on.
467260	468260	It's a massive shock.
468260	470260	I mean, do you think you'll stick it?
470260	471260	Yeah.
471260	472260	The whole thing?
472260	474260	Yeah, I've got no doubts about that, yeah.
474260	476260	We've been talking about for the last kind of two days, really,
476260	478260	that it would be a great shame if anybody left.
478260	480260	But I now think we need to look at it positively.
480260	483260	And as harsh as it is, perhaps we've streamlined, actually,
483260	484260	and more determined.
484260	486260	I think those who've stayed, you know,
486260	488260	have showed a certain determination.
491260	493260	We've got no personality clash this morning.
493260	495260	Personality clash is now in the camp.
495260	497260	Everybody gets along, everybody really likes each other.
497260	499260	We're going to have some really good bonds out of this,
499260	502260	not only the achievement of doing it, which we will,
502260	506260	and a new friendship is going to develop between us all.
506260	508260	Teamwork makes the dream work, Vic.
508260	509260	Yes, it does, sir.
509260	511260	Stop staring at my sexy bottom, though.
511260	512260	It's upsetting me.
512260	515260	I could feel your eyes penetrating my underpants.
519260	521260	Morale in camp has lifted,
521260	522260	but events of the past
522260	524260	few days have taken their toll.
524260	526260	Oh, I'm absolutely connected.
526260	528260	The men have barely eaten since they arrived
528260	530260	on the island some five days ago.
530260	533260	I do feel like we're staring down the barrel a little bit.
533260	536260	We're going to have to pull something out of the bag
536260	539260	or go very, very hungry, it seems to me.
539260	542260	Are we not wise to have a real good recce of the island?
542260	545260	There's going to be wildlife somewhere around that rocky bit.
545260	546260	Yeah. There's got to be.
546260	549260	We need to really go through the interior of this island
549260	550260	to find out what's living where.
550260	551260	We could come across lights,
551260	554260	you drive in the country and you see all of a sudden
554260	557260	a field full of rabbits because they love a certain area.
557260	558260	Yeah.
558260	560260	It might be exactly the same with your goaties,
560260	561260	exactly the same with the lizards.
561260	563260	I think it's a really, really good shot, Vic.
573260	574260	Come on, boys.
574260	578260	5am the following morning, the hunt for food begins.
578260	579260	No heroes today.
579260	581260	We don't want anyone to lose their leg or arm.
581260	583260	You've got your stick there, haven't you, fella?
583260	584260	I've got a stick.
584260	586260	I'll grab a stick if you need one.
589260	592260	Are we going to dance first? A hunt dance?
598260	600260	We have an alpha male in our family.
600260	602260	Obviously, in my house, I'm it.
602260	603260	The dogs know I'm in charge.
603260	605260	My wife lets me think I'm in charge.
605260	607260	My kids look up to me as if I'm in charge.
607260	609260	Alpha male, you know what I mean?
609260	610260	I'm Johnny Wise Muller.
610260	611260	I'm the alpha male.
611260	612260	I'm Tarzan.
612260	613260	I'm all them things.
613260	615260	I'm looking forward to being able to know that I can,
615260	619260	come the zombie apocalypse or whatever world issue will befall us,
619260	623260	that if push comes to shove, I could still provide for my family.
623260	625260	My dream is for them guys to go,
625260	628260	''That's my dad, that. That's fantastic. My dad did that.''
630260	632260	Iguanas live up trees, is that right?
632260	635260	Yeah, keep your eyes absolutely peeled.
635260	637260	Shit, I wish I had my glasses.
637260	640260	To ensure that these guys have a fighting chance of surviving,
640260	643260	I've made sure there's enough water, indigenous animals,
643260	646260	and vegetation on this island to keep them alive.
646260	649260	But they've got to have the ingenuity and the skills
649260	652260	to find it, hunt it, and kill it.
652260	654260	Whoa, whoa, whoa, look, look, look, look, look.
654260	656260	Rays, fuck, they're shallow, aren't they?
656260	657260	We need a weapon.
657260	658260	We need a spear.
658260	660260	Okay, try that, try that.
660260	662260	Come on, boys, let's get one of these.
666260	668260	They're going deeper.
668260	671260	Something weighs one, survivors nail.
676260	679260	Anything that's heart is beating in its chest, I will eat it.
679260	680260	Yeah.
680260	683260	My biggest observation about living in a jungle
683260	685260	is how quickly you lose your sentimentality.
685260	687260	When I look at something, I'm not thinking,
687260	689260	''That's beautiful,'' or, ''Look at the little creature.''
689260	691260	I'm thinking, ''Can I eat that?''
691260	693260	Hurry up, there's an iguana.
693260	695260	Just straight through.
695260	697260	There's an iguana.
697260	698260	Just straight through.
698260	700260	Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
700260	702260	And you keep at him.
702260	705260	And you go out and round, push him back to you.
705260	706260	What's that?
706260	708260	Stamp on him, he flip-flops.
708260	710260	It's there, I could see it.
710260	711260	There's some stingrays, guys.
711260	713260	Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
713260	715260	Okay, he's in. Go, go, go, go, go, go!
715260	717260	Get him! Oh, and you get him.
718260	720260	Oh! Get him behind it.
720260	722260	Oh!
722260	724260	Cut him off.
724260	725260	Get him, get him.
725260	726260	Get him, get him.
727260	729260	Get him, get him, get him.
734260	736260	There he is, there he is.
736260	738260	That's dinner.
738260	740260	Son of a bitch!
740260	742260	He's gone.
743260	745260	A death man could hear us coming.
746260	748260	We are top predator.
748260	750260	We've got to stay that way.
750260	752260	If we're going to survive, if not,
752260	754260	we'll all be going home shortly.
754260	758260	The men's first day's hunting has produced nothing.
758260	760260	We are winging it.
760260	762260	And if it weren't for being such a stubborn person
762260	763260	and so positive,
763260	765260	I think I'd have been on my way a long time ago.
765260	769260	Starving and dehydrating slowly is not a nice way to go.
769260	771260	The monsoon is coming.
771260	772260	Here it comes.
772260	773260	Here it comes.
773260	775260	Land on the hatches.
775260	776260	In the middle of the night,
776260	779260	the men are woken by the most vicious tropical storm yet.
779260	781260	Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
781260	783260	Whee!
783260	785260	I'm fucking pissing, Darren.
785260	786260	It's amazing.
786260	788260	From nowhere, you get that really big wind.
788260	789260	Yeah.
789260	791260	Whoa!
791260	794260	Where's the pan to protect the fire?
794260	795260	Fuck!
795260	797260	Fucking hell.
797260	798260	Shit.
799260	800260	Wow, it's coming in.
800260	804260	After yesterday's exhausting and fruitless search for food,
804260	807260	the men must now spend precious energy saving their fire.
807260	809260	This is where we dig deep, boys.
809260	811260	This is where we dig deep.
811260	812260	But for some,
812260	813260	it's becoming hard.
813260	814260	It's becoming too much.
814260	816260	I'm just really, really tired.
816260	818260	Like, unbelievably tired.
818260	819260	I've got a lack of dry wood.
819260	821260	That's just the problem, really.
821260	824260	Lack of dry wood.
824260	827260	So tonight's going to be a bit difficult now.
827260	830260	Barney, these things are eating testers, my man.
830260	831260	I know.
831260	834260	It's what we do in adversity what makes us men.
836260	837260	Oh, ho, ho!
837260	838260	See that?
838260	839260	Wow!
839260	841260	Come on, mother nature, do your worst!
843260	846260	We're almost there!
859260	861260	About 8 o'clock in the morning.
861260	865260	Hammer it down, which it has been since about 4 o'clock this morning.
865260	867260	And when I say hammer it down, I mean hammer it down.
867260	868260	It's relentless.
869260	872260	But anyway, my body's starting to take its own name.
872260	876260	I've got blisters all over my feet.
876260	878260	I'm shivering and shaking all the time.
878260	880260	It's just bloody horrible.
880260	883260	It's whooped my arse big time.
883260	886260	In fair play to these other guys.
886260	888260	I mean, they're like gladiators.
888260	890260	Unbelievable.
890260	893260	And in comparison, I'm a pussy.
893260	895260	He's an older guy,
895260	898260	and he's starting to come up with the part at the seams.
898260	900260	No food, no sleep.
900260	902260	Wet, cold, beaten up.
902260	904260	It takes its toll.
909260	911260	How's the wood looking down? Terrible.
911260	914260	Everything's just absolutely soaking wet.
914260	919260	After a night-long struggle, the men manage to save their fire.
919260	921260	But now they're exhausted.
921260	923260	It's a perpetuating cycle, isn't it?
923260	926260	The more you lack in energy, the less you can do.
926260	929260	Having barely eaten in the last week...
929260	930260	Barely.
930260	931260	Barely's rambling.
931260	934260	..their situation is getting desperate.
934260	939260	We need to find a solid source of protein and carbohydrate
939260	941260	or we are going to seriously struggle.
941260	942260	It's getting to the point now,
942260	944260	if we don't eat properly in the next few days,
944260	946260	I can see other people leaving this island.
946260	950260	We're hunting, we will go. We're hunting, we will go.
950260	953260	Come on, let's rock and roll.
953260	957260	The men head out once again on the search for food.
957260	959260	But today, 51-year-old builder Andy
959260	962260	is too tired to join them.
962260	964260	You all right, mate?
964260	965260	You OK?
965260	967260	Not really, no.
967260	968260	You look exhausted.
968260	970260	I'm not sleeping at all.
970260	972260	Maybe 20 minutes.
972260	974260	And even when I am lying there,
974260	977260	my brain's still whizzing away, you know?
977260	980260	It's starting to drive me fucking nuts.
980260	982260	And I just hope for you all.
985260	987260	Oh, mate, what?
989260	992260	I'm worried about Andy.
992260	994260	Yet again, he woke up this morning
994260	996260	to say that he's not a decent, nice kid.
996260	998260	What can you do, you know?
998260	1001260	Come on, fella. It's all right.
1001260	1003260	How about this?
1003260	1005260	It's me and you. Build a bed.
1005260	1008260	Get some comfy bedding and a roof.
1008260	1010260	Let's make that.
1010260	1012260	And you've got a decent bed.
1012260	1014260	Right, come on, me and you. Let's go.
1019260	1021260	Come on.
1024260	1026260	These are alligators on this island.
1026260	1028260	Son of a bitch.
1029260	1032260	Led by cleaning facilities manager Vic,
1032260	1036260	the hunting party are pushed deep into the island's interior.
1036260	1038260	What have you seen, Vic?
1038260	1040260	Alas, nothing.
1040260	1043260	But finding food in the jungle is no easy task.
1046260	1047260	Wow.
1047260	1048260	It's just full of...
1049260	1051260	..ants and eggs.
1051260	1052260	Snake!
1052260	1054260	Where?
1054260	1057260	And danger lurks around every corner.
1057260	1060260	Somewhere here is a brown snake.
1060260	1062260	Been like shit off a stick.
1062260	1064260	This is good bait.
1064260	1066260	Shit.
1066260	1068260	There's a scorpion here.
1068260	1069260	Whoa.
1069260	1071260	I do not want to get stung.
1071260	1072260	Yeah, he's gone.
1072260	1073260	OK.
1073260	1075260	Bastard. I can taste him from here.
1075260	1078260	There's a lot of things that can kill you on this island.
1078260	1081260	Snakes, spiders, crocodiles.
1081260	1084260	The longer I'm here without a proper meal,
1084260	1086260	the more I realise that if something's going to fuck us up,
1086260	1089260	it's probably going to be a lapse in concentration.
1092260	1093260	Ooh, you fucker!
1093260	1095260	There's bats everywhere.
1095260	1097260	Straight out of that tree there.
1097260	1099260	That's where the bats live.
1099260	1101260	Ooh!
1101260	1102260	Can we eat bats?
1102260	1103260	I don't know.
1103260	1105260	Is that what gives you HIV and Ebola and all sorts of...
1105260	1107260	Yeah, don't they carry your aids?
1107260	1109260	Forget it. We're not eating bats.
1109260	1111260	This island looks very peaceful.
1111260	1113260	You could even say heavenly.
1113260	1116260	But if you look just at a little bit more depth,
1116260	1119260	this place is an accident waiting to happen.
1120260	1122260	So why are you doing this then, fella?
1122260	1125260	I think because my life has been like one adventure, you know?
1125260	1129260	Moving from Tenerife, Lanzarote, America, all that kind of stuff.
1129260	1133260	But then the last 17 years, I've been stagnant, doing nothing.
1133260	1135260	So I think this was a way of sort of saying,
1135260	1136260	right, off we go again.
1136260	1138260	And that it is, my friend.
1138260	1140260	Yeah, it certainly is. Jesus.
1140260	1142260	If only I'd have known.
1142260	1144260	Are you regretting it?
1144260	1147260	I am at this moment, mate, if I'm totally honest, yep.
1147260	1151260	And my biggest regret, if I do go, would be letting you lot down.
1154260	1157260	I'm trying. I'm really trying.
1157260	1159260	It seems like Andy's already given up.
1159260	1162260	I'm desperate not to lose another person, you know?
1162260	1164260	I can't go from 14 down to 11.
1166260	1170260	I'm dropping like flies. We've not even started yet.
1174260	1176260	Is that not a caiman track?
1176260	1178260	Er, he might be a white one.
1178260	1180260	After a fruitless morning in the jungle,
1180260	1184260	some of the men have set their sights on a far more ambitious prize.
1185260	1187260	We're off caiman hunting.
1187260	1188260	It's this way down here.
1188260	1190260	See those trees?
1190260	1192260	That's where it comes out. Yeah.
1192260	1195260	28-year-old website consultant Kyle
1195260	1198260	has spotted a crocodile at the end of the beach.
1198260	1201260	Five of us are going that side, five of you this side.
1201260	1203260	Keep your eyes behind you.
1203260	1205260	Which the men are hoping to ambush.
1205260	1207260	He's going to see you when he comes out.
1211260	1214260	Along the coast, 29-year-old paramedic Barney
1214260	1217260	and cameraman Ross are off to try their luck
1217260	1219260	with improvised fishing rods.
1219260	1221260	I'm going to be incredibly positive.
1221260	1224260	We're going to get at least a couple of fish. Yeah.
1224260	1227260	At least a minimum of a couple of fish. Yes.
1229260	1230260	I've delivered three babies
1230260	1233260	in the course of my seven years in the ambulance service,
1233260	1235260	and that's a pretty special feeling.
1236260	1239260	But it's not as glamorous as everyone makes out.
1239260	1243260	You soon realise it's largely dealing with drunk people in gutters,
1243260	1246260	vomit-ridden kind of students.
1247260	1250260	I love the famous five, Swallows and Amazons.
1250260	1252260	It's something about probably going on your own adventure.
1252260	1254260	It takes you back to your childhood, doesn't it?
1254260	1256260	Building trees, building dens.
1256260	1258260	It would be nice to think I've come off the island
1258260	1260260	feeling a little bit more macho,
1260260	1262260	a little bit more popular with the ladies.
1265260	1267260	There's a lot of fish down there.
1267260	1269260	Come on, positive thoughts are going through the rod.
1271260	1273260	Oh, I've got a big one!
1273260	1275260	Whoo!
1275260	1277260	Fuck!
1282260	1283260	Pull me down.
1283260	1286260	The men have been attempting to stake out a caiman
1286260	1288260	for almost two hours,
1288260	1291260	but so far they haven't seen a thing.
1291260	1292260	What do you think?
1292260	1295260	I think some of our hunting team is always ready in action,
1295260	1296260	ready to go.
1296260	1298260	I like your coil of spring.
1299260	1300260	It would be fantastic if we could get a caiman,
1300260	1303260	but you also need to get water, fire and food.
1303260	1304260	I am starving.
1304260	1305260	Come on, then, mate.
1305260	1309260	Plus, everyone's just getting eaten to shit by these sand flies.
1309260	1312260	Well, let's return to camp.
1313260	1315260	Start to finish, absolute joke.
1315260	1317260	Everybody just went up there, asked about it.
1317260	1320260	We had no plan when we got there, no nothing.
1320260	1321260	We were like Keystone Cops.
1324260	1326260	So that's going to be great.
1326260	1327260	Right, I'm going to gamble this.
1329260	1330260	Oh!
1331260	1332260	Eh?
1332260	1333260	There you go.
1333260	1334260	I've been bouncing it.
1334260	1335260	Yeah.
1335260	1336260	Mate, didn't get any fucking better.
1336260	1337260	Yeah.
1337260	1339260	Ain't got to worry about creepy crawlies.
1339260	1340260	OK, how about this?
1340260	1342260	If you have a decent night's sleep,
1342260	1344260	give a decent night's kit tonight and stay.
1344260	1345260	I will do that.
1345260	1346260	I promise.
1346260	1347260	OK.
1347260	1348260	Are we happy?
1348260	1349260	I'm happy, mate.
1349260	1350260	You're a wonderful man.
1351260	1352260	Top man.
1352260	1353260	I'm going to hold you to it, you know?
1353260	1354260	I know you will.
1356260	1357260	Hey, come on.
1357260	1358260	Bring in the love.
1368260	1370260	Sadly, all the cupboards are bare.
1370260	1375260	After an exhausting day, the hunting party have nothing to show for their efforts.
1375260	1378260	They didn't look healthy, some of these boys.
1378260	1381260	Some of them look like maybe gone on hunger strike.
1381260	1383260	Well, I'm absolutely burnt out.
1383260	1388260	Today's a day where I definitely feel like I am starving.
1388260	1392260	So the average British man needs about 2,500 calories a day.
1392260	1398260	But the reality of a survival situation here, you're working hard, you're hunting and building shelters, chopping wood.
1398260	1399260	You can easily burn.
1399260	1402260	You can easily burn in excess of 4,000 calories.
1402260	1404260	The mass of that is simple.
1404260	1407260	If you're burning more than you're taking in, you're going to starve.
1408260	1410260	Can you just let the lads know that we've gone fishing?
1410260	1411260	All right.
1411260	1413260	I've got some energy still left in me.
1413260	1418260	With nightfall approaching, the men are desperate to salvage something from the day.
1421260	1423260	What the fuck was that?
1423260	1425260	Something just fucking...
1426260	1427260	Something stung you?
1427260	1428260	Yeah.
1430260	1432260	Fuck me, do I know about it?
1432260	1433260	You can't see what it was?
1433260	1434260	No.
1436260	1438260	Definitely wasn't a scorpion, was it?
1438260	1439260	I have no idea.
1439260	1441260	Mic to India, mic to India.
1441260	1446260	Cameraman Sam uses the emergency sat phone to call the offshore medical response team.
1446260	1451260	Charlie has been stung on the toe from something in a wood pile.
1451260	1452260	Fuck me.
1452260	1454260	Oh, shit, it's a scorpion, yeah.
1454260	1455260	It's a scorpion, guys.
1455260	1456260	Where is it? Let me feel it.
1456260	1457260	Here.
1457260	1458260	Scorpion.
1458260	1460260	Confirmation, it is a scorpion, over.
1461260	1463260	It's a general rule of thumb.
1463260	1468260	The bigger the pincer, the smaller the stinger, the less deadly the scorpion.
1468260	1472260	Bark scorpion, enough venom in that stinger to kill a man.
1473260	1474260	Not good, man.
1474260	1475260	Not good.
1475260	1478260	I don't know much about scorpions, but I think there is a kind that's very, very poisonous.
1478260	1480260	We were told before we got here that that could kill you.
1480260	1481260	Fuck.
1481260	1482260	Fuck, man.
1482260	1483260	That's not what we need.
1483260	1487260	The medics have asked Sam to urgently identify the type of scorpion that stung Charlie.
1487260	1488260	That stung Charlie.
1488260	1489260	Ah, dude.
1489260	1490260	Is it painful?
1490260	1491260	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1491260	1495260	Okay, so that length, that is what, two inches long?
1495260	1498260	So he's got big claws, which is a good thing.
1498260	1500260	The bigger the pincers, the less the venom, apparently.
1500260	1501260	So fingers crossed.
1501260	1504260	He doesn't look like a bark scorpion, does he?
1504260	1510260	To treat it symptomatically in peace, the response can't be updated on the condition of the patient, over.
1510260	1512260	Copy that, will do.
1512260	1515260	Fucking, this mate is so sensitive.
1515260	1516260	So?
1516260	1522260	So, good news, from the description of this little bad boy here, from that pincer, that
1522260	1524260	probably means he's not super toxic.
1524260	1527260	We're going to keep an eye on you, make sure that that doesn't swell massively and you
1527260	1529260	don't get any other allergic reactions.
1529260	1534260	It's like someone's driving roasting hot needles in and out.
1534260	1535260	Yeah.
1535260	1536260	I think you're milking a bit now, mate.
1536260	1537260	Oh, no, I need to suck it up, don't I?
1537260	1539260	Oh, come on, you're supposed to be English.
1541260	1545260	Thankfully, it wasn't particularly poisonous, but it must have hurt.
1545260	1546260	Like, nobody's business.
1546260	1547260	Poor guy.
1547260	1548260	Charlie, Charlie.
1548260	1549260	I do not need dipping over.
1549260	1550260	Thank you.
1550260	1551260	Charlie, seriously, keep your weight off it.
1551260	1552260	Oh, actually, maybe.
1552260	1553260	Keep your weight off it.
1553260	1554260	Easy.
1554260	1555260	Don't cry.
1555260	1558260	It's not nice to see anyone like that, really.
1558260	1562260	The boy is what I would like to call OTG.
1562260	1564260	He is out the game.
1564260	1570260	The medics have advised Charlie to stay off his feet for the rest of the day.
1570260	1574260	Let's go and be the saviours of today.
1574260	1577260	Go on, then.
1577260	1578260	OK.
1578260	1579260	Rods.
1579260	1584260	With now only an hour to sunset, paramedic Barney and cameraman Ross set out to make a
1584260	1587260	last-ditch attempt to catch dinner for the group.
1590260	1592260	Yeah, let's go.
1592260	1596260	But to get back to the headland where they've seen most fish, they face a treacherous scramble
1596260	1598260	across the rocks.
1598260	1601260	It's quite hot, isn't it?
1601260	1603260	And the tide's coming in fast.
1604260	1608260	So I feel there is a bit of a risk, actually.
1608260	1611260	I don't like to take risks.
1611260	1614260	We're not going to gain anything by walking back now, are we?
1614260	1615260	No.
1615260	1616260	Let's do it.
1616260	1617260	Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
1617260	1618260	Sorry.
1618260	1619260	Hang on.
1619260	1623260	I have to wait for the tide to go out, and then we're making that gap there.
1623260	1626260	So the Pacific really is just a vast ocean.
1626260	1630260	It's actually the largest in the world, covering over 60 million square miles.
1630260	1632260	You've got these fierce ocean currents.
1632260	1634260	They swirl around these little islands.
1634260	1639260	And if you get swept out into them, you really genuinely don't stand a chance.
1639260	1642260	The next stop that way is the Galapagos Islands,
1642260	1644260	but the sharks don't get you first.
1647260	1648260	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1652260	1654260	Oh, I don't know if this is a good idea to make or not.
1654260	1655260	Whoa!
1655260	1666260	Taking quite a risk just to get a fish.
1666260	1668260	It's been a while since I've been hungry.
1668260	1670260	And you've got to take risks, haven't you, really?
1670260	1671260	What do you think?
1671260	1672260	Is this a bit dodgy, or?
1672260	1674260	Good.
1674260	1681260	As long as we're on the same wavelength, the sea's a lot rougher, though.
1681260	1684260	If we get swept off it, we're mincemeat.
1684260	1690260	Just one of those gates here.
1699260	1701260	You OK, Ross?
1701260	1704260	Barney and Ross finally reach the point where they want to fish,
1704260	1706260	but it's now going dark.
1708260	1710260	Do you ever think you could do that, Barney?
1710260	1712260	God, no.
1712260	1713260	Not in a million years, do you?
1713260	1714260	No, wasn't it?
1714260	1716260	Ah, it's so exciting.
1716260	1719260	It's that proper survival, isn't it?
1719260	1721260	It's not armchair survival.
1724260	1726260	Oh, mine's a tough one.
1726260	1728260	Ah!
1728260	1730260	Ah, shit!
1730260	1731260	Ross?
1731260	1733260	Quick, mate, quick as you like.
1734260	1736260	Fucking lost the camera.
1736260	1737260	Are you OK?
1737260	1739260	Just get up out of here, mate.
1739260	1741260	Fuck!
1743260	1744260	Oh!
1744260	1746260	God, no!
1746260	1748260	Just watch out.
1759260	1760260	What am I touched on?
1760260	1762260	The camera's every time.
1762260	1764260	Eh?
1764260	1765260	The camera's ever fucking smashed into Ross.
1765260	1768260	I think it's fair to say we nearly got killed, actually.
1768260	1770620	We walked up there to do some fishing.
1770700	1772740	We put the phone down.
1772820	1775500	He was behind me. I turned round to see a huge wave,
1775580	1778220	probably about ten feet, engulf Ross,
1778300	1780180	and then Ross was gone, like that.
1782100	1784900	And then I ran down and managed to grab him.
1784980	1786180	I pulled him out.
1787940	1789820	I've never been so terrified in my life.
1790860	1792220	You've got to be serious, mate.
1794820	1796460	Afternoon, guys. Where you been?
1796540	1797540	Hello, boys.
1797540	1799700	I'm shaken, to say the least.
1799780	1801780	Do you want to take more of us, I think?
1801860	1802980	Make some room for the guys.
1803060	1804860	There's a massive wave right over me,
1804940	1806260	swept me straight out on the rocks.
1806340	1808580	While we were fishing, straight out, like that?
1808660	1810060	Grabbed the rocks back up,
1810140	1811820	and then another massive one took us both down.
1811900	1814860	Can we please say no more fishing at night, then, please?
1814940	1815860	Yes.
1815940	1818220	You are a true team man, aren't you?
1818300	1822300	It's really made me realise just how careful we need to be
1822380	1826300	and how careful I need to be and about how vulnerable I am.
1826380	1827500	Despite feeling as though
1827580	1830900	as a young guy that actually you are invincible,
1830980	1834500	out here, it's just not the case at all.
1834580	1835620	You all right?
1835700	1836700	You look fresh, near a death experience.
1836780	1837620	Yeah.
1837700	1838820	Mark, you look shaken, man.
1838900	1839860	I am shaken.
1839940	1841060	Have a drink.
1841140	1842580	We did get some fish, though, right?
1842660	1844060	Seriously?
1844140	1845900	That's what you take from that?
1847340	1849260	Tell you what, this is one hell of an adventure, isn't it?
1849340	1852580	It's turned out to be a real men and mice game, this.
1855620	1857420	Good night, everybody. I'm sorry I'm not being rude.
1857620	1859580	Get some rest, mate.
1859660	1863500	51-year-old Andy hasn't slept well since arriving on the island.
1863580	1865820	I'm absolutely exhausted.
1865900	1868980	Concerned he'll leave if he doesn't get some quality rest,
1869060	1872020	the group are hoping his new bed is the answer.
1872100	1876580	Andy's got the skill set that we absolutely desperately need on the island.
1876660	1881020	He's a builder by trade, so he could shortcut so many of our processes.
1881100	1883500	So, you know, I want him to stay.
1883580	1887340	He didn't... I'm sure he didn't come on the island to fail.
1887540	1891700	So, if you have a decent night's kip, then you're not going to leave us?
1891780	1892860	That was the deal, wasn't it?
1892940	1895220	If I have a decent night's kip.
1895300	1896300	All right, then.
1902980	1906220	5am. All of the men are sound asleep.
1907660	1908780	Except for one.
1911140	1912740	I'm feeling dreadful.
1912820	1915740	I've got an ear infection. I'm shaking.
1915820	1917420	I know I'm shut down. You know what I mean?
1917540	1920300	So, I'm not happy.
1920380	1922580	I'm not happy about it, right?
1925140	1927300	Andy woke up this morning, first thing he said to me, he said,
1927380	1929100	''Oh, I'm off.''
1929180	1931060	He's crying out loud.
1931140	1932620	Paul and Joe have just gone.
1932700	1935940	That Paul's just gone because of you, Andy.
1936020	1938140	If you thought you were going to go, why didn't you...?
1939820	1943300	I just found out that we're losing Andy and our final builder.
1943380	1945820	It's almost panic stations.
1945900	1947460	Are you suggesting we're not leaving?
1947580	1948860	Are you fucking bollocks?
1948940	1949940	Right, I'm walking away.
1950020	1952580	I'll hug you to a tree before you fucking go.
1952660	1954940	Andy's threatening to leave us all very well,
1955020	1957420	but I'll be patient.
1957500	1960420	Part of me just wishes, if he's going to go, he should just fuck off, really.
1967180	1970980	I'd like to say I want the boat here now, over and out. Bye.
1972060	1974780	Just a day after deciding he would stay,
1974860	1977300	Andy uses the emergency satellite phone
1977300	1979020	to request an evacuation.
1980460	1983900	Andy Pandy is leaving today.
1983980	1986700	Something that I kind of predicted, really.
1988340	1991060	I think Paul was just an excuse.
1991140	1993940	So, really, it was a shame that Paul had to go
1994020	1996620	because Andy was always going to go in the end.
1996700	1997940	Take care.
1998020	2000420	I can't give myself or you guys any more. I'm sorry.
2001980	2003180	What can you do, you know?
2003260	2005940	We're down to 11 people after not even a week.
2007300	2009260	It's just embarrassing.
2013820	2015780	When people leave a survival group,
2015860	2019860	the remaining members can often feel this sense of desertion,
2019940	2023180	betrayal, maybe even a little bit of jealousy.
2023260	2025980	I mean, who wouldn't want to leave what, for many of them,
2026060	2028140	really is a living hell?
2028220	2030740	But ultimately, losing a negative influence
2030820	2032980	will be a good thing for the long term of the group.
2037300	2038980	I've been pretty tired today.
2040100	2041860	Really could do with some food.
2042820	2045460	Eight days in, with barely a thing to eat,
2045540	2047980	and delayed by Andy's departure...
2048060	2050060	Fucking little fish.
2050140	2052500	..the men resume their daily search for food.
2053660	2056540	I don't know why people choose to do this in their free time.
2056620	2057700	Fish? Yeah.
2057780	2058780	I don't do a lot of it.
2058860	2061340	Father-in-law lives it, absolutely fucking lives it.
2061420	2062340	He's a dick.
2064820	2066900	Every day is a white day...
2068300	2070060	..while the others hunt.
2070140	2073340	29-year-old Barney has volunteered for fire duty.
2073420	2077020	I'm happy, actually, because I'll do it back at base.
2078700	2081820	The grouper, worried that his near-death experience yesterday
2081900	2083820	has knocked his confidence.
2083900	2086140	He literally got swept off the rocks.
2086220	2087780	He's got bumps and scrapes,
2087860	2091780	and if it wasn't for Barney saving Ross's life,
2091860	2093540	things would have been really serious.
2093620	2097060	I think it's just a reminder of what this place is like.
2097060	2102180	It just feels like everything around us is genuinely trying to kill us.
2102260	2105300	He's such a nice guy, so easy to relate to,
2105380	2107020	but I just felt a little bit sorry for him today,
2107100	2108620	so I'm going to keep my eye on Barney.
2115420	2118100	I think he was crying now, just before you got the camera.
2118180	2119580	He is finding it really tough.
2122140	2125980	He is seriously lethargic, looks seriously homesick,
2126060	2126940	and he's a grouch.
2126940	2128620	He needs to get himself back on his feet.
2128700	2130620	Having already lost three men,
2130700	2134940	cameraman Ross is worried the group could soon be in danger of losing another
2135020	2137620	and persuades Barney to join him on a fishing trip
2137700	2139620	in an attempt to lift his spirits.
2141100	2144900	I thought you looked really low and that you weren't enjoying yourself
2144980	2147020	and just looked like you wanted to get out of here.
2147100	2148380	I was a bit worried that you might go,
2148460	2150380	fuck it, and leave, you know?
2150460	2152500	I think everyone's having their low days too, right?
2154500	2156940	After any sort of frightening near-death experience,
2157020	2161780	it's very normal to become withdrawn and a little bit introverted,
2161860	2164780	and people tend to then do everything they can
2164860	2167660	to avoid having to face that same fear.
2167740	2171500	But trying to survive on a desert island, the men don't have that luxury.
2171580	2174500	They need to conquer their fear, otherwise it will conquer them.
2176700	2179500	I'm finding it difficult now, actually.
2179580	2182180	I feel like I've had enough of being here.
2183420	2186060	And every time I think about my family, I find it more difficult.
2187020	2192820	And I realise that this week is the week that I'm meant to be at Centre Parcs.
2202220	2204220	But I just wanted to kind of apologise.
2211620	2213420	There's a little blue fish down here.
2213500	2214700	So have you got a spear?
2214780	2215780	Yeah.
2215860	2216900	That makes a fish.
2217020	2219140	He's a fucking good fish, I know that.
2219220	2221220	Bastard.
2221300	2225180	In their first week on the island, the men have barely eaten.
2225260	2227260	That spear's not worth donkey poo.
2227340	2228340	Fucking rubbish.
2229540	2233820	All of their attempts to find a decent meal have ended in failure.
2233900	2236900	No luck today, but that's why it's called fishing and not catching.
2238100	2243260	Today's lunch for 11 famished men is slim pickings from the jungle floor.
2243340	2246180	Guys, this is exciting.
2246260	2247260	Scorby?
2247340	2249020	It's got a few ants on it at the moment,
2249100	2250700	because we killed it about half an hour ago.
2252860	2254660	But who's up for a leet?
2254740	2256060	Yes, please.
2256140	2257140	Fuck it, I'll eat it.
2257220	2258380	Heaven in your mouth.
2258460	2259460	Burn the ants off.
2260780	2263220	Da-da-da!
2263300	2264300	Where's the game?
2264380	2265980	Why haven't you given it to him, then?
2266060	2267100	Why can't I have any?
2267180	2269260	Oh, because you're too northern.
2269340	2270860	I'm too northern?
2270940	2273500	I'm feeling victimised because I'm the northern one.
2273580	2275300	That's it, you can all kiss my arse.
2276180	2278940	You're a brave man, Dan.
2279020	2280140	What's it like?
2280220	2281220	It's pretty gross.
2281300	2282300	Is it?
2282380	2283380	It's like eating crispy poo.
2283460	2284460	Is it?
2284540	2285540	Yeah.
2285620	2287060	I'm glad it was you, then.
2287140	2290940	In a survival situation, every mouthful counts.
2291020	2292500	Tell you what, it's better than limp it.
2292580	2293980	Is it?
2294060	2296540	But one scorpion between 11 grown men
2296620	2299340	is nowhere near enough to save them from starvation.
2301180	2302860	It's hard to concentrate.
2302940	2305300	I'm noticing that energy is so low.
2305380	2306140	I'm so bloody hungry.
2306180	2307140	I'm going to burn out.
2308580	2310220	Man, this place wears you down.
2312340	2313340	It really does.
2314540	2316660	I just tried standing up,
2316740	2320740	and then started sort of got the standard head brushes,
2320820	2324220	and then really just, I was just sort of rocking backwards and forwards.
2324300	2328180	I don't know, only for a few seconds, but enough to put me on my arse.
2328260	2331700	It's getting to the point now, if we don't eat properly in the next few days,
2331780	2334060	we're going to drop like flies.
2334140	2336140	Despite their rapid physical decline,
2336220	2339220	their men have no choice but to keep on hunting.
2339300	2341860	It's quite a daunting thing, really, isn't it?
2341940	2344380	The idea that we might come across Heyman today.
2344460	2347980	37-year-old Sam has persuaded Barney to join him
2348060	2351260	in a bid to keep him busy after his accident.
2351340	2354740	I can't convey how tough this whole thing has been, actually.
2354820	2356660	Far, far tougher than I thought.
2356740	2358940	I'm really, really struggling to...
2361020	2365540	..to stay focused and to keep up with the rest of the team.
2365620	2367940	There's a berry on this tree. Here, look.
2368020	2370180	Doesn't look edible, does it?
2370260	2373300	Shit the dog! Shit the dog!
2373380	2375900	Look at that. A big, big lizard under here.
2377580	2379500	It's an iguana. I can see it's a big one.
2383140	2384140	Yes, keep going.
2385540	2387500	Yes, there you go. Good.
2387580	2390820	OK, you see him there? I'm going to flick him out.
2390900	2393460	OK, here he comes. Here he comes. Here he comes.
2393540	2395420	Here he comes. Here he comes. OK, watch that tail.
2395540	2397940	OK, you've got him. You've got him. You've got his tail.
2398020	2400460	Pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him, pull him.
2400540	2402140	Pull him, pull him, pull him.
2402220	2404220	You absolute... Stop!
2404300	2405620	Stop!
2405700	2407740	Oh, my gosh. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
2407820	2409620	Let's talk about this, because, actually,
2409700	2411940	we could use our meat alive, could we not?
2412020	2415500	Oh, my gosh. Well done, mate. Well done.
2415580	2417180	Oh-hoo-hoo!
2417260	2418500	Oi!
2418580	2420500	Whoo!
2420580	2422500	Get in!
2422580	2423700	Yeah!
2423780	2424660	Yeah!
2425540	2426780	Hooray!
2426860	2427860	Whoo-ya!
2427940	2429340	Hooray-ho-ho-ho!
2429420	2430740	It's an iguana!
2430820	2431820	Oh!
2431900	2432900	Get in, Barney.
2434300	2435300	Get in.
2435380	2437140	Look at the size of that one.
2437220	2438660	Wow, Barney, that's half a leg.
2438740	2440140	Now he's a cock-a-banny, lad.
2440220	2441420	That's dinner and supper.
2441500	2442660	Well done, fella.
2442740	2444580	Nice little Barney.
2444660	2447740	He's a beautiful creature, actually, absolutely beautiful.
2447820	2449340	Look, he's like a little dinosaur.
2449420	2451460	Guys, this is my little contribution to today.
2451540	2452460	Wow.
2452540	2453780	It's an amazing feeling.
2453860	2455500	You really feel you've done your bit
2455580	2456580	for the team.
2456660	2459700	It's like when you give a really good Christmas present,
2459780	2461340	you just really want to give it.
2464060	2466300	I was thinking, guys, about killing that iguana.
2466380	2467380	Yeah.
2467460	2469540	I think that's probably a bit of a personal thing I need to get over.
2469620	2471380	I'm not killing something. Hang on a minute.
2471460	2473900	Why is that such a bad thing, that you do want to kill something?
2473980	2477180	Because the reality of it is that we all eat meat that's killed at some point,
2477260	2480460	and we're so far detached, aren't we, as we all know,
2480540	2483660	from the slaughtering process, that actually, for me,
2483740	2484940	maybe that's a challenge that I need to face.
2484980	2489940	If you kill it, will you have repercussions, sleepless nights,
2490020	2491020	in everyone?
2491100	2492220	Nobody!
2492300	2493900	I don't give a...
2493980	2495660	Blood, gush, stinking.
2495740	2497180	Let's put this in perspective. That bothers you?
2497260	2500620	I've been a paramedic for four years and seen some fantastic things, but...
2500700	2502460	I think I'd like to test myself.
2502540	2504460	Do it. Do it if you want to do it.
2504540	2506580	Don't do an Ozzy Osbourne and bite its head off, though.
2512980	2514060	Barney, how are you feeling?
2514940	2517900	It suddenly feels much more real
2517980	2521060	when you're having to sit here like the executioner, you know?
2525860	2527900	I condemn you and Juana to death.
2527980	2529500	It goes right over, doesn't it?
2529580	2530580	Like this.
2535220	2536460	Let's do it. I'll go and get him.
2537460	2538620	Bring him down here, yeah?
2540420	2541420	Woof.
2541500	2542860	All right, you got him. You got him.
2542940	2544060	Got him, got him, got him.
2544140	2544780	Yeah.
2544940	2546420	All right, Barney.
2546500	2549020	Yeah, so if you're able to hold his head down, actually...
2553140	2554060	Spot on.
2554140	2555660	...the food you're about to provide.
2561340	2562260	Great effort, Barney.
2562340	2563340	Well done, Barney.
2565020	2565820	You all right, mate?
2565900	2566900	Yeah.
2566980	2568460	Fucking hell.
2568540	2571140	A couple of my really close friends have got iguanas,
2571220	2573380	and I really don't know how they'll view this.
2573460	2574260	I don't think you...
2574940	2577180	I understand that this is completely a survival situation,
2577260	2578220	and I have...
2578300	2580140	Their pets are not in danger.
2580220	2583140	They can leave me in the lounge without them.
2585700	2586940	It's a very mix of emotions,
2587020	2588140	because you really have provided,
2588220	2591020	and everyone's got some food tonight, including myself.
2591100	2592500	Hopefully, it gives you a more...
2592580	2593980	a greater respect for the animal
2594060	2596220	than if I would just sit round tonight
2596300	2598220	having somebody else killed it.
2598300	2600340	I'm going to enjoy that meal more than anyone tonight.
2602580	2604740	I've seen it myself so often, you know,
2604740	2606860	it's a very quiet, humble individual
2606940	2609460	who the group maybe initially discount,
2609540	2611940	but suddenly they can become the man of the hour,
2612020	2613980	just in one heroic moment.
2614060	2617740	And these brave people earn respect through their deeds.
2617820	2620220	They don't earn it through, you know, bluster.
2620300	2622860	And really, that's what British courage is.
2629740	2631340	After a week on the island,
2631420	2634100	the men can finally sit down to a decent meal.
2634740	2636220	It's like proper food.
2636300	2638260	Isn't that just an incredible sight?
2638340	2640420	Yeah, anything caramelised on the outside would be beautiful.
2640500	2641900	This is going to be like...
2643100	2645140	Is he eating his own neck?
2645220	2646140	Yeah.
2646220	2648460	That's just sick, Barney.
2648540	2651020	They do say that Mother Nature watches what you do,
2651100	2653260	and if you work hard enough, she rewards you.
2653340	2654580	Today, she did.
2654660	2655620	Good job, Barney.
2655700	2659220	Here you go, guys. Well done, and congratulations.
2659300	2661580	Well done, teams. Off to the Leavenses.
2661660	2662940	To the Leavenses.
2663020	2664020	Yes.
2664740	2666540	Let's have a little taste, pass them on.
2666620	2667620	Oh, it's delicious.
2667700	2668700	It's really lovely.
2668780	2669780	So good.
2669860	2671260	The first time I've eaten something
2671340	2674460	which is ridiculously, amazingly brilliant.
2674540	2675940	Oh, that looks like a good piece, Barney.
2676020	2677020	Yes, it is, mate.
2677100	2679060	Oh, yeah, Barney.
2679140	2680780	There's more meat on this than I thought.
2680860	2682140	Toilets, toilets.
2682220	2683220	Oh, yeah.
2683300	2685020	The Leavenses sitting around that cave, man,
2685100	2688060	just gnawing and slurping and chewing
2688140	2690540	and staring into the flames.
2690620	2691860	Great.
2691940	2692700	Grr.
2692780	2694540	He's now literally cut his face in two.
2694740	2695980	There you go.
2696060	2697060	Yes.
2697140	2699860	Feeling increasingly manly as the day goes on.
2699940	2701740	See what it brings the group.
2701820	2703420	It all feels worthwhile.
2703500	2704940	No complaints with this at all.
2705020	2706020	Yeah, great.
2706100	2707820	I think the head might be my favourite bit.
2710020	2711740	With food in their stomachs,
2711820	2714820	the men's thoughts turn to Andy's unoccupied bed,
2714900	2716740	which is now up for grabs.
2716820	2718540	No wanking the individual bed, please.
2718620	2720940	OK, I've completely misunderstood what it's for.
2721020	2722900	LAUGHTER
2722980	2723900	We'll put it...
2723900	2725980	Has anyone knocked one out yet?
2726060	2727500	Dude, after the third night...
2727580	2728740	You're doing away?
2728820	2729820	Every morning.
2729900	2731740	I woke up prouder than a honeymooner, though.
2731820	2733820	Seriously, you could want, like, a single-man A-frame.
2733900	2735020	Come see me in the morning.
2735100	2737580	LAUGHTER
2737660	2740100	Buzzing tonight. Buzzing.
2740180	2744820	It felt like a bunch of 11 mates sat around a campfire,
2744900	2747380	on a wee holiday, eating great food.
2747460	2750180	Fantastic 14 is now the excellent 11.
2750260	2751980	LAUGHTER
2752060	2753020	I'm under no illusions.
2753020	2754580	Things will come.
2754660	2757460	But if it means something, I remember it's a good,
2757540	2758900	and they're good.
2758980	2759980	It's right now.
2760060	2761140	Buzzing
2761220	2762940	Help! Back in!
2763020	2764580	Next time on the Women's Island...
2764660	2766620	I'm coming!
2766700	2769900	Radio in now. Medic now.
2769980	2771260	Oh, my God.
2771340	2772420	What's just happened?
2772500	2773500	Just collapsed.
2773580	2774900	Oh, don't you see that?
2774980	2775980	LAUGHTER
2776060	2778500	The group are still separated.
2778580	2781900	Everyone needs off here. It's not a programme. It's ridiculous.
2781980	2782860	Oh, my God!
2783020	2784180	67.
2784260	2785580	I can't navigate!
2785660	2788980	I can't walk and I'm just fucked, I'm an old fox.
2789060	2790660	Buzzing.
2790740	2792700	Buzzing.
2792780	2795340	Buzzing.
2795420	2797420	Buzzing.
2797500	2800440	Buzzing.
2801860	2803780	Buzzing.
2803860	2805220	Buzzing.
2805300	2807140	Buzzing.
2807220	2809660	Buzzing.
2809740	2810780	Buzzing.
2810860	2812780	Buzzing.
2812780	2814840	you
