00:00.000 --> 00:14.700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.700 --> 00:24.180
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women when pushed to the limits of

00:24.180 --> 00:32.520
human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the winds a day who will have what it

00:32.520 --> 00:45.600
takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men Britain today we've never been further from a

00:45.600 --> 00:53.820
hunter-gatherer origins but I want to know when stripped of everything

00:54.180 --> 00:57.360
has modern man still got that instinct to survive

00:59.760 --> 01:06.600
to find out a marooning 14 ordinary men on a desert island this is crazy this is absolutely

01:06.600 --> 01:12.060
crazy this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever

01:15.360 --> 01:20.400
they'll have to endure six weeks in the height of the harsh tropical storm season

01:20.400 --> 01:23.640
this is the worst you can do

01:24.180 --> 01:30.540
they'll be utterly alone filming everything themselves we have two choices one we go down

01:30.540 --> 01:39.600
the 40-foot Ravine holy well we keep going through this of a jungle they'll have to find their own

01:39.600 --> 01:49.260
water and hunt for their own food we've just got a prehistoric animal you lazy bunch of bone idle

01:49.260 --> 01:53.820
bastards have these modern day men got what it takes to survive

01:54.180 --> 02:03.540
that's the hardest thing I've done

02:17.520 --> 02:24.120
I personally don't think men are as strong now as they were I wouldn't even say 50 years ago even

02:24.180 --> 02:30.300
five years ago because we have it too easy the interesting question to ask actually is if we

02:30.300 --> 02:35.880
lost everything what would happen to us it'd be nice to think I've come off the island feeling

02:35.880 --> 02:41.880
a little bit more macho a little bit more alpha male a little bit more popular with the ladies

02:43.560 --> 02:48.960
I'm about to abandon these men on a remote Pacific island to see if they can survive

02:50.340 --> 02:53.820
they will be utterly alone my oldest was 19.

02:54.180 --> 02:57.900
he only needs me for money in a lift and the youngest one's too cool to hang around with

02:57.900 --> 03:03.060
dad my dream is for them guys to go that's my dad that that's fantastic my dad did that

03:04.860 --> 03:09.360
I don't think I've done anything that's put myself at risk really but I'm scared he's

03:09.360 --> 03:12.840
taking a graphic designer on an island with no other skills whatsoever anything could happen

03:13.860 --> 03:19.680
these 14 ordinary men do not know each other and they have no experience in living in the wild

03:20.760 --> 03:23.640
at the moment I don't enjoy day-to-day life

03:24.180 --> 03:28.560
I've got a stressful job I've got a newborn baby at home I want to go on the island to

03:28.560 --> 03:34.260
get away from the day-to-day I think everyone in life does take certain things for

03:34.260 --> 03:38.460
granted electricity when you turn on the light having a warm shower having breakfast when it's

03:38.460 --> 03:43.140
not there and you wake up in the morning and go where's the next meal coming from it's a man test

03:43.140 --> 03:51.660
isn't it okay guys we're getting closer you are very remote here the next stop that way is New Zealand

03:54.180 --> 04:00.900
out is has all of this cushioning that civilization has experienced over the last 50 years made us

04:00.900 --> 04:07.740
totally lose touch with that survival instinct that I believe is deep within us all okay guys

04:07.740 --> 04:14.040
I need you to be my eyes for any rocks and loads of rocks it takes an extreme situation to find out

04:14.040 --> 04:22.560
what people are really made of what you're about to embark on it will be the toughest thing you will

04:24.180 --> 04:32.640
do this all right you can do it the men's home for the next six weeks is an uninhabited island

04:32.640 --> 04:39.900
in a remote Pacific archipelago the 11 kilometers of coastline is dominated by treacherous cliffs and

04:39.900 --> 04:48.700
rocky headlands vicious swells and powerful ocean currents means there's no easy way onto

04:48.700 --> 04:53.580
the island I'm gonna try and get you guys as close as I can all right

04:54.180 --> 05:01.680
but you will end up swimming any of you guys are weak swimmers it is a good time to say I've never

05:01.680 --> 05:06.480
swam this distance before not even a swimming pool but I will get there I will get there age won't

05:06.480 --> 05:13.320
stop me doing this not often in one's life someone actually challenges your morals challenges you

05:13.320 --> 05:18.900
physically and this does that's why I want to do it who can't swim confidently confident with

05:18.900 --> 05:20.520
unconfident yeah let's go

05:24.180 --> 05:28.680
the men must make the 75 meter swim to the island fully closed

05:29.640 --> 05:34.080
help each other help those who are weaker let's go let's go

05:35.880 --> 05:42.480
strong undercurrents mean the men need to get to shore as quickly as possible

05:48.840 --> 05:51.060
go get out of the water go go go

05:54.180 --> 06:00.400
out of the water go see if they can

06:05.520 --> 06:10.020
wow that was the damnedest thing I ever did

06:16.740 --> 06:19.680
I couldn't have gone much further but that's only a taste of what we've got to come then bring it children yeah well the advice is

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
take your own piss which is a bit unnerving with only two days survival training initiative will be key

06:21.680 --> 06:23.980
essentially it's water isn't it is that your favorite��요

06:24.180 --> 06:26.180
You've got to save your piss, mate. You've got to save your piss.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.180
Yeah, yeah. Save your piss.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.180
Drink your own piss!

06:30.180 --> 06:32.180
I hope not.

06:32.180 --> 06:35.180
So, they look a bit like a party of drowned rats at the moment.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.180
Kind of let the chaos begin.

06:37.180 --> 06:41.180
But what I do know is, when I return in six weeks' time,

06:41.180 --> 06:44.180
the 14 men, if there are still 14 men there,

06:44.180 --> 06:47.180
which, to be honest, I doubt,

06:47.180 --> 06:49.180
the men that do remain...

06:49.180 --> 06:51.180
..will be changed.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.180
It's time for me and the crew to leave.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.180
We won't be back until the end of the experiment.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.180
For the next six weeks,

07:01.180 --> 07:04.180
the men will have to live entirely on their own wits.

07:05.180 --> 07:09.180
To make sure these men at least have a fighting chance at survival,

07:09.180 --> 07:11.180
I've ensured the island's got enough water,

07:11.180 --> 07:15.180
indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.180
It's teeming with wildlife.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.180
But what they've got to have is the ingenuity

07:20.180 --> 07:21.180
to find it,

07:21.180 --> 07:22.180
catch it and kill it.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.180
What's your name, mate?

07:24.180 --> 07:25.180
Paul.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.180
I'm Ross.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.180
Hello, Ross.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.180
From here on in,

07:28.180 --> 07:31.180
everything you see will be filmed by the men themselves.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.180
Why don't we get everybody together

07:34.180 --> 07:38.180
and then we'll work out something that we're going to do

07:38.180 --> 07:40.180
and then we're all going to be heading that way,

07:40.180 --> 07:41.180
I'm assuming, anyway,

07:41.180 --> 07:43.180
because it looks a little bit safer than this,

07:43.180 --> 07:45.180
cos it'll be dark soon.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.180
Come on, lads, let's make use of some of this energy while we've got it.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.180
All of the men will film,

07:50.180 --> 07:54.180
but four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.180
I'm Ross.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.180
Sam.

07:56.180 --> 07:57.180
How you doing, mate?

07:57.180 --> 08:01.180
Who'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.180
Oh, I'm like a fucking mule arse, aren't I?

08:04.180 --> 08:06.180
The brains of a donkey!

08:06.180 --> 08:10.180
Obviously, because we are having to film everything ourselves,

08:10.180 --> 08:14.180
we've got to cart all of the camera gear, batteries and everything with us.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.180
Let's do it.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.180
Let's get on with it.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.180
For fuck's sake, this is survival, not Good Morning Britain.

08:20.180 --> 08:23.180
As well as the camera equipment, they'll have a medical kit,

08:23.180 --> 08:26.180
two jerry cans containing a day's supply of water,

08:26.180 --> 08:30.180
basic fishing equipment and a handful of tools.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.180
Guys, how many knives do we have? Let's count them in.

08:32.180 --> 08:34.180
Three knives, three machetes.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.180
Three knives, that's easy.

08:35.180 --> 08:37.180
So, I'll gather round in one group, guys.

08:37.180 --> 08:40.180
I'm Barney and I'm a paramedic from Leicester.

08:42.180 --> 08:44.180
I'm Andy Bennett, builder for Milton Keynes.

08:44.180 --> 08:46.180
We've got a fucking builder, everybody!

08:47.180 --> 08:49.180
Let's hope he's not a cowboy.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.180
My name's Piers, I am a doctor.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.180
I'm Kyle and I'm a website consultant.

09:01.180 --> 09:04.180
My name's Paul, I invented the dice.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.180
I'm a construction contract manager.

09:11.180 --> 09:15.180
It's 4pm. With only two hours of daylight remaining,

09:15.180 --> 09:19.180
the men's priority has to be finding a safe place to shelter for the night.

09:21.180 --> 09:25.180
If they can't, they'll have to sleep rough on the jungle floor,

09:25.180 --> 09:29.180
alongside potentially deadly scorpions, snakes and caiman crocodiles.

09:31.180 --> 09:34.180
We're assuming that the north side of the island

09:34.180 --> 09:37.180
would be nice beachy, sandy, flat seas.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.180
Paul thinks the group's best option is a beach.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.180
Let's go.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.180
And he's convinced they have time to cross the island

09:44.180 --> 09:46.180
to find one before dark.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.180
Who else was imagining sunny beaches

09:49.180 --> 09:51.180
when they thought about coming out here?

09:51.180 --> 09:53.180
These trees here are very sharp.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.180
There you go.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.180
I believe it will now be referred to as the porcupine tree.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.180
Vicious.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.180
The interior of the island is three square kilometres

10:05.180 --> 10:08.180
of mangrove swamp and unbroken jungle.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.180
And I know from experience

10:10.180 --> 10:12.180
that moving through dense island undergrowth

10:12.180 --> 10:14.180
is a slow, exhausting work.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.180
It will do all you can to stop you in your tracks.

10:17.180 --> 10:21.180
And often, the harder you push, the harder it pushes back.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.180
Whoa! Stop!

10:25.180 --> 10:27.180
There's a snake down here.

10:27.180 --> 10:28.180
It's a boa, isn't it?

10:28.180 --> 10:30.180
Take its head off if it's a decent size, mate.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.180
Get stuck in.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.180
Is anyone going to help me?

10:32.180 --> 10:35.180
I'm trying to carry a bag and a machete and kill a snake.

10:35.180 --> 10:38.180
He's looking pretty aggressive. He's coiling, isn't he?

10:38.180 --> 10:41.180
I need a long stick just to put on its head.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.180
Mind you, no snake.

10:43.180 --> 10:44.180
Mind you...

10:44.180 --> 10:47.180
No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that, for fuck's sake.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.180
Listen, should we just throw this case on it?

10:49.180 --> 10:50.180
No.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.180
Part of me thinks, should we just leave it?

10:52.180 --> 10:54.180
Didn't even flinch, did it?

10:55.180 --> 10:57.180
Yeah, yeah, let's keep going.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.180
If we don't get out of this shrub,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.180
we're going to be sleeping here tonight.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.180
It ain't safe and it's not cool.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.180
With just an hour to go until nightfall,

11:08.180 --> 11:11.180
the men have covered barely 400 metres.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.180
Paul!

11:12.180 --> 11:13.180
Yes?

11:13.180 --> 11:15.180
You going to come and get a drink?

11:15.180 --> 11:16.180
The darker it's getting,

11:16.180 --> 11:18.180
the more it's getting a little bit worrying.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.180
Tap on it when you're done.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.180
Somehow I've fallen into chief navigator mode,

11:22.180 --> 11:23.180
but I'm on it.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.180
My days are very stressful.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.180
It really doesn't fucking matter.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.180
I don't give a fuck.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.180
A lot of the time I think that most people are fucking idiots.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.180
Just get that load out, get that load out.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.180
You can't build the internal walls anyway.

11:37.180 --> 11:41.180
Being called a bastard is just a friendly greeting

11:41.180 --> 11:43.180
in the building industry.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.180
Get in there and get it done.

11:45.180 --> 11:48.180
This experience might change me.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.180
Hopefully for the better.

11:50.180 --> 11:53.180
It might make me be a little bit more tolerant of other people.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.180
Come on, fuckers.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.180
This is going to take us fucking hours.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.180
Yeah, it's about to get darker and darker as well.

11:59.180 --> 12:02.180
Yeah, I know, so that's why we've just got to get through it.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.180
We need to start to think,

12:03.180 --> 12:05.180
do we want to be hacking through this stuff

12:05.180 --> 12:06.180
when it's pitch black,

12:06.180 --> 12:08.180
or the next time we see a clearing,

12:08.180 --> 12:10.180
are we going to think about settling down for the night?

12:10.180 --> 12:13.180
Mate, I personally want to just plough on and make it.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.180
I mean, it's going to get darker in here

12:15.180 --> 12:17.180
quicker than it is on the beach.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.180
I say we plough on.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.180
This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.180
I don't know what to say right now.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.180
I never had the money to go travelling.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.180
I've never done anything that's been a bit sort of edgy,

12:33.180 --> 12:35.180
that's been a bit...

12:36.180 --> 12:38.180
..dangerous, I guess.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.180
I don't think I'm as confident as I was

12:40.180 --> 12:41.180
as I say I am,

12:41.180 --> 12:44.180
and I think a lot of what I do can be a front.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.180
The sort of persona of alpha male to me

12:47.180 --> 12:49.180
is everything my stepdad was.

12:49.180 --> 12:52.180
I saw enough of him growing up to realise who not to be.

12:52.180 --> 12:55.180
I guess it's time to find out who I really am.

12:55.180 --> 12:58.180
Keep coming! We're only 100 metres away!

12:59.180 --> 13:02.180
It keeps saying it's like the beach is 100 metres away.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.180
It's all getting a little bit pissed off

13:04.180 --> 13:06.180
because we've been walking for about fucking miles

13:06.180 --> 13:07.180
and it's not here.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.180
The temperatures are freeing.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.180
It's like 51-year-old builder Andy is struggling to keep up.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.180
At the moment, it's like every man for himself.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.180
For fuck's sake.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.180
First.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.180
Cut.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.180
We've not even made any ground

13:29.180 --> 13:32.180
and we are all...fucked.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.180
Joe, pop Randy and help you.

13:36.180 --> 13:39.180
He's got a really awkward box on his arm.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.180
I know it's a ball-legged kid,

13:40.180 --> 13:42.180
but you're carrying one of the fucking easiest things in the world.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.180
I'm a fuck.

13:43.180 --> 13:44.180
I know it's heavy.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.180
I'm a fuck, pal. No, I'm not.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.180
But it's easy.

13:46.180 --> 13:47.180
You want to carry this bag?

13:47.180 --> 13:48.180
It's fucked.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.180
I'll swap you now, mate, if you want.

13:53.180 --> 13:58.180
At the front, Paul pushes on, despite the group's growing descent.

13:59.180 --> 14:01.180
Have we got lights in those cameras, Sam?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.180
Bit of infrared.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.180
How you doing, mate?

14:04.180 --> 14:05.180
Some people ain't playing ball.

14:05.180 --> 14:07.180
In what way? What do you mean?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.180
Oh.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.180
Cracking on with fuck all, you know?

14:11.180 --> 14:13.180
We could all do that, like a hero with a machete.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.180
Come on.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.180
For fuck's sake.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.180
I know we all want to get on, but...

14:18.180 --> 14:20.180
you've got to think of everybody else now. We're a team.

14:20.180 --> 14:22.180
You can't just be selfish, you know?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.180
Oh, there's a bit of light, look.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.180
This is amazing.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.180
I've found the sea.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.180
Ah.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.180
Ah.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.180
Oh.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.180
Yeah, it's a good beach.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.180
Come on.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.180
Hooray, boys.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.180
Come on.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.180
Booyah.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.180
Beach.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.180
Ha, ha.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.180
Pina coladas.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.180
It's the hardest thing I've ever done.

15:08.180 --> 15:10.180
Come on.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.180
Come on.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.180
Fuck.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.180
I never thought I'd be so happy to see the beach in my entire life.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.180
Well done, mate. Well done.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.180
Fuck.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.180
Nice one, mate.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.180
Oh.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.180
I never doubted myself.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.180
Never underestimate your own abilities.

15:44.180 --> 15:47.180
The sun's just beginning to set, so we're just in time.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.180
And everyone is on such a high right now.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.180
That's a whale.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.180
It's a whale.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.180
Wow.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.180
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

15:56.180 --> 16:00.180
We're still there watching the sunset, and there's whales swimming past us.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.180
Pretty cool.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.180
You don't get that often, do you?

16:08.180 --> 16:10.180
You're right.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.180
About two minutes sleep, I think.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.180
One time, huh?

16:13.180 --> 16:19.180
16 hours ago, I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote desert island.

16:19.180 --> 16:22.180
I haven't slept for a minute.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.180
Not a minute.

16:24.180 --> 16:29.180
They have spent their first night on the beach with no shelter.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.180
Is that really shit?

16:31.180 --> 16:33.180
Oh, what have we done?

16:33.180 --> 16:36.180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.180
You never get that realization.

16:38.180 --> 16:41.180
You've done something you didn't quite think all the way through.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.180
At one point, I was shitting if we were going to get washed away.

16:43.180 --> 16:45.180
I was like, did it get that close?

16:45.180 --> 16:47.180
I mean, you can see the line, mate.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.180
You can see the line.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.180
The line's, what, three foot away from where we were?

16:53.180 --> 16:57.180
Look at the amount of rubbish on this beach.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.180
Has anyone found a left shoe?

16:59.180 --> 17:02.180
Yeah, but these, I'm not too sure if I'm going to go for these.

17:02.180 --> 17:04.180
What are you?

17:04.180 --> 17:05.180
A bit last season.

17:05.180 --> 17:06.180
Hey, lads.

17:06.180 --> 17:07.180
Look.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.180
Found a pink pair.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.180
These are bloody comfortable.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.180
Look at these bad boys.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.180
This is the male version.

17:20.180 --> 17:25.180
The men came onto the island with just a day's supply of drinking water.

17:25.180 --> 17:26.180
Mouthfuls.

17:26.180 --> 17:32.180
But after yesterday's arduous trek in 34-degree heat, it's all but gone.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.180
Tropical storm season.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.180
Really, there shouldn't be any shortage of water.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.180
And obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.

17:38.180 --> 17:41.180
But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.180
All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.

17:43.180 --> 17:49.180
From experience, I can tell you, animals aren't fussy about where they crap.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.180
Oh, my God.

17:51.180 --> 17:53.180
Look at all the crap that's in there.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.180
That's fucking horrible.

17:55.180 --> 18:03.180
Without boiling, this rancid water would almost certainly give the men stomach cramps and diarrhoea.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.180
It's not salty, but...

18:05.180 --> 18:06.180
I'll tell you what.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.180
I've had hangover shits that smell better than that.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.180
Guys, can we...

18:09.180 --> 18:14.180
Why don't we all kind of gather in and have some sort of conflab about what we're going to do today?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.180
Yeah, I think that might be a very good idea, please.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.180
Go on, guys.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.180
Gather round.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.180
You want a plan of action, lads?

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
Yeah.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.180
We 100% need to try and make a fire now.

18:23.180 --> 18:30.180
If we don't make a fire and something to boil new water, we are going to be in bad shape by tomorrow morning.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.180
Food is becoming a priority very quickly.

18:32.180 --> 18:37.180
For a lot of people, we're going to have to get something substantial to eat fairly soon.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.180
Right.

18:38.180 --> 18:40.180
Meet and adjourn.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.180
Shall we dance, sir?

18:42.180 --> 18:43.180
Is that ready?

18:43.180 --> 18:44.180
Let's go.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.180
The men decide to split up.

18:46.180 --> 18:52.180
Having eaten nothing since they arrived, the majority of the group head off to look for food,

18:52.180 --> 18:56.180
while engineer Dan and builder Andy take on the fire lighting.

18:56.180 --> 18:59.180
It's quite a lot of pressure to get this fire going.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.180
You're down?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.180
I'm up.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.180
Yeah.

19:02.180 --> 19:03.180
To me?

19:03.180 --> 19:04.180
To me.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.180
Awesome.

19:05.180 --> 19:07.180
That is not an ideal start, is it?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.180
That did one stroke.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.180
Oh, lads.

19:10.180 --> 19:13.180
I shot my load.

19:13.180 --> 19:18.180
Round about here, there's about six, maybe ten snails and shit, yeah?

19:18.180 --> 19:25.180
Along the coast, 47-year-old Vic has decided to put Joe, the group's youngest member, to work.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.180
We should definitely have put some fucking shoes on.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.180
That might have been a wise idea, fella.

19:29.180 --> 19:30.180
Oh!

19:30.180 --> 19:31.180
Just anything.

19:31.180 --> 19:33.180
Limpets, crabs, give them a crack.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.180
Snails.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.180
You spot them, fella, and I'll club them.

19:36.180 --> 19:38.180
Do these snails bite?

19:38.180 --> 19:41.180
I feel as though something with legs is going to come out of there, innit?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.180
A nippy.

19:42.180 --> 19:46.180
Don't put your finger where you won't put your dick, because it might get bit.

19:46.180 --> 19:51.180
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the nearest we get to Michelin star.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.180
Will we put it on a bed of anything?

19:53.180 --> 20:01.180
One.

20:01.180 --> 20:06.180
A morning's hard graft provides nothing more than a handful of limpets.

20:16.180 --> 20:17.180
Give it a good old cheer.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.180
Fucking hell.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.180
Yeah.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.180
Yeah, it's tough.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.180
Limpets.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.180
Limpets are horrendous.

20:24.180 --> 20:26.180
You don't buy them in supermarkets, do you?

20:26.180 --> 20:28.180
So they're not known for being very nice.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.180
I don't think they're very nice at all.

20:32.180 --> 20:35.180
For now, the men will have to go hungry.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.180
Stop.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.180
Who said there's no smoke without fire?

20:41.180 --> 20:43.180
Lying bastards.

20:43.180 --> 20:45.180
The fire's pissed me off a little bit.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.180
I just don't know what we're doing wrong.

20:49.180 --> 20:52.180
Lighting a fire has become an urgent priority.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.180
It's 34 degrees in the shade,

20:55.180 --> 20:59.180
and the men have had little to drink in the past 12 hours.

20:59.180 --> 21:01.180
We've literally, we've got no water.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.180
None at all?

21:02.180 --> 21:03.180
None.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.180
I had a piss 20 minutes ago,

21:05.180 --> 21:07.180
and it was like pissing lion's golden syrup.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.180
I had to push it out.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.180
That is not viscous and clear.

21:15.180 --> 21:16.180
No, it's definitely not.

21:16.180 --> 21:21.180
The men are starting to show the telltale signs of serious dehydration.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.180
Thirsty, really bloody thirsty.

21:31.180 --> 21:32.180
Gone out of me.

21:32.180 --> 21:33.180
I said, fuck off.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.180
The vultures are circling already.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.180
Look at the size of that.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.180
Jesus.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.180
That's prehistoric.

21:42.180 --> 21:43.180
How about your glasses?

21:43.180 --> 21:44.180
Do you reckon we can...

21:44.180 --> 21:45.180
Can I try your glasses?

21:45.180 --> 21:46.180
Try it, mate.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.180
Yeah.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.180
With their need for fire now critical,

21:49.180 --> 21:50.180
web consultant Kyle,

21:50.180 --> 21:52.180
has an idea he wants to try.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.180
We've got Andy's glasses.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.180
Just basically using the sun to focus at one point

21:58.180 --> 22:00.180
is giving us quite a lot of heat.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.180
Come on.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.180
Come on.

22:04.180 --> 22:07.180
Hoping that's going to work, the old glasses.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.180
Let go, let go.

22:14.180 --> 22:16.180
Oh, go on, Andy lad.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.180
Sticks.

22:17.180 --> 22:18.180
Get the little sticks.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.180
Preparation.

22:19.180 --> 22:20.180
Where's the next last stick?

22:20.180 --> 22:21.180
Where's the rest of the shit?

22:21.180 --> 22:22.180
Where's the rest of the stuff?

22:22.180 --> 22:23.180
Sticks.

22:23.180 --> 22:24.180
Fucking sticks.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.180
Get up there.

22:25.180 --> 22:26.180
Get up there.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.180
Swipe right side.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.180
Swipe right side.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.180
All right.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.180
Put it off.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.180
Put it off.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.180
Real tight.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.180
Breathe it.

22:33.180 --> 22:34.180
Go on, Andy.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.180
Go on, son.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.180
Go on, son.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.180
Go on.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.180
Slow.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.180
Slow hard.

22:39.180 --> 22:40.180
Slow hard.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.180
He'll go.

22:41.180 --> 22:42.180
Come on.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.180
That's it.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.180
Come on.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.180
It's nigger there.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.180
Keep going.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
Keep going.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.180
Keep going.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.180
Keep going.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.180
Sticks.

22:50.180 --> 22:51.180
Twigs.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.180
You got it.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.180
The little twigs.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.180
Yeah.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.180
Twigs.

22:55.180 --> 22:56.180
Yeah, twigs.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.180
Found you.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.180
Twigs.

22:58.180 --> 22:59.180
Slowly, slowly.

22:59.180 --> 23:00.180
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.180
Yeah.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.180
There we go.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.180
Bingo.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.180
Well done, you two.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.180
It was Kyle that started it.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.180
Good.

23:06.180 --> 23:07.180
Of course it was.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.180
He showed me the way and I followed through.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.180
I see.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.180
We've done well.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.180
We got there.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.180
Absolutely brilliant.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.180
Well done.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.180
What a dark horse.

23:14.180 --> 23:15.180
Excuse the pun.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.180
We all take it back about the IT guy.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.180
Fucking yes.

23:18.180 --> 23:19.180
Well done, Kyle.

23:19.180 --> 23:28.180
After eight hours of trying, the men finally have a fire on which to boil the stagnant water.

23:28.180 --> 23:32.180
I'm going to drink and drink and drink until my piss falls clear.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.180
And your verdict is?

23:33.180 --> 23:35.180
I mean, it's almost like normal water.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.180
There's a bit of sort of pond in there.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.180
That is top notch.

23:39.180 --> 23:43.180
It doesn't taste like piss, does it?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.180
It tastes like metal weight tea.

23:45.180 --> 23:48.180
As long as the fire stays lit, the men will have a source of safety.

23:48.180 --> 23:50.180
They have a source of safe drinking water.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.180
A little bit of that.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.180
A little bit of that.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.180
One achievement there.

23:53.180 --> 24:02.180
But keeping it alight during tropical storm season will be a huge challenge.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.180
Shit.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.180
Look at that rain.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.180
So look like right there, tropical paradise.

24:06.180 --> 24:07.180
And then there.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.180
Shit hole.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.180
Shit hole.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.180
It's like Waitrose and Aldi all in one picture.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.180
What I'm worried about is that this hot shoe is still wet.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.180
Oh shit.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.180
Right here?

24:13.180 --> 24:14.180
It's not wet.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.180
It's just cold.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.180
But it's not like the weather.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
The temperature is protect us from cold.

24:17.180 --> 24:20.420
What I'm worried about is everyone's off doing other things,

24:20.460 --> 24:23.180
and in a minute, it's going to be pissing down with rain.

24:23.220 --> 24:27.660
I actually think it'd be quite important to build a shelter for the fire.

24:27.700 --> 24:31.340
I've not got the energy to build a shelter or anything at the moment.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.140
If I could, I would, I promise you.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.940
A little bit worried about Andy.

24:36.980 --> 24:41.100
He seems to have separated himself from the group a little bit.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.940
When everybody's together, he walks off.

24:42.980 --> 24:46.740
He's now making a bed over there, which just seems a bit childish.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.580
Feels like he doesn't want to be part of the group.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.100
Hey, hey, I've got a bed.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.100
All I want to do at the moment is get some sleep.

24:54.140 --> 24:55.740
Just some, you know?

24:59.460 --> 25:01.300
I think middle age has made me boring.

25:01.340 --> 25:04.700
I've got a beautiful wife, lovely house, nice job, etc.

25:04.740 --> 25:07.580
All the stuff that most people strive to get.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.940
And yet I'm still searching for something.

25:09.980 --> 25:12.180
Perhaps all men get like that, I don't know.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.020
Perhaps I make a mid-life crisis.

25:14.060 --> 25:16.700
I don't like myself as much as I used to, put it that way.

25:16.780 --> 25:20.900
I think I need a new adventure, to put that right.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.140
Do you want to help us get a sink, just to cover this up?

25:37.180 --> 25:39.140
Cos it's going out already.

25:39.180 --> 25:41.020
An hour before sunset...

25:41.060 --> 25:43.260
The heavens have opened, as expected.

25:44.580 --> 25:45.620
We've got a fire going.

25:45.660 --> 25:46.540
Yeah, but we've got to put...

25:46.540 --> 25:47.380
This is brilliant.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.820
However, it is now pissing down with rain.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.460
We've got no cover over it whatsoever.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.340
We've got nowhere to sleep whatsoever.

25:55.380 --> 25:59.820
So I would say our priority is shelter.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.780
Honestly, in the politest way possible,

26:01.820 --> 26:05.300
we need to cover up this fucking fire cos it's going to go out.

26:05.340 --> 26:09.980
Without the fire, the men will have no means of purifying water to drink.

26:10.020 --> 26:13.300
Who is doing the leaves? Is anybody getting the leaves to cover this?

26:13.340 --> 26:15.420
That is going out in about half an hour.

26:15.420 --> 26:21.140
Yeah, clusterfuck. Or foovar. I don't know what the correct military term is.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.140
So now we've got a million people trying to do a million things.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.100
Hopefully we'll have a million answers.

26:26.140 --> 26:27.580
George is fucking mad.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.940
This rain is absolutely unbelievable.

26:37.980 --> 26:40.700
You don't ever see rain like this in the UK.

26:40.740 --> 26:43.300
Absolutely, completely...

26:43.340 --> 26:44.300
Stoking.

26:44.340 --> 26:45.260
8pm.

26:45.260 --> 26:48.580
The men are still desperately trying to make a watertight shelter

26:48.620 --> 26:50.380
to save their fire.

26:50.420 --> 26:52.380
Over and under. That's it.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.820
See if we can bend it, Bart.

26:54.860 --> 26:59.100
In this part of the Pacific, storms can last for days

26:59.140 --> 27:02.540
and dump inches of rain in an hour.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.580
It's a great night.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.980
Obviously, we're staying dry under the shelter that we've made.

27:07.020 --> 27:11.340
It's a good job we made it, otherwise we'd be absolutely saturated right now.

27:11.380 --> 27:15.060
The roof might need possibly a tweak or two.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.780
There is a minor bit of snagging before practical completion.

27:19.820 --> 27:24.220
It's just something simple like perhaps taking the whole fucking thing down and redoing it.

27:28.820 --> 27:31.380
Has anyone checked on Andy?

27:31.420 --> 27:32.660
Fuck, we've got one.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.100
Andy!

27:34.140 --> 27:35.820
Andy!

27:35.860 --> 27:38.020
Andy!

27:38.060 --> 27:39.700
We've got a headlight, guys.

27:39.740 --> 27:45.100
Andy chose to not help the group in any way, shape or form.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.620
And went off on his own.

27:46.660 --> 27:47.780
Andy's here.

27:47.820 --> 27:49.300
Vicky and Andy's here under the tree.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.860
I think Andy needs to get a little bit more involved with this all, to be honest.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.260
It absolutely pissed down last night.

28:01.300 --> 28:06.500
Everyone was awake and everyone was just so wet through.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.860
I was sat there and I was just thinking, what am I doing here?

28:09.900 --> 28:11.740
I feel kind of pissed.

28:11.780 --> 28:13.820
Yeah. It's weird.

28:13.860 --> 28:13.980
Yeah.

28:14.020 --> 28:14.940
I feel like...

28:14.940 --> 28:16.620
I've had a couple of pints.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.180
I can't move my legs.

28:18.220 --> 28:20.060
I've sat up, I just can't move.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.060
Has the bed paralysed you?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.140
Yeah. That's great.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.460
Completely numb from cocked down.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.260
6am.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.780
Last night, a violent tropical storm battered the island.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.580
After a desperate struggle, the group managed to save their fire

28:37.620 --> 28:40.060
with a small temporary shelter.

28:40.100 --> 28:43.420
But the men themselves had no protection from the elements.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.660
Video diary.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.140
I don't know what day it is.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.060
I don't know if it's day two, day three.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.100
Still no sleep after getting on the island.

28:53.140 --> 28:57.340
I think I've had about, honestly, swear to God, an hour's sleep.

28:57.380 --> 28:58.580
I can't do it.

28:58.620 --> 29:02.900
I've got to think about myself now, you know?

29:02.940 --> 29:04.620
Yeah. I've been up all fucking night.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.180
I'm a mess because of it.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.780
Sleep really is critical to survival

29:08.820 --> 29:11.460
because it affects our physical and our mental health.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.500
When you get enough of it, it helps your body to recover,

29:14.500 --> 29:17.620
to heal, you process thoughts, process memories,

29:17.660 --> 29:20.940
but when you don't get enough of it, that's when you become careless,

29:20.980 --> 29:23.140
it affects your decision-making abilities

29:23.180 --> 29:25.180
and it can even lead to depression.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.420
How you doing, fella?

29:29.460 --> 29:30.660
Ooh. What's up?

29:32.300 --> 29:34.420
I'm struggling a bit, I think.

29:36.060 --> 29:37.780
At the moment. With?

29:37.820 --> 29:39.700
The mentality of it all.

29:39.740 --> 29:42.580
You know what I mean? You've got to get yourself in, like...

29:44.500 --> 29:49.020
..in the zone, as it were, and I'm struggling to find the zone, at the moment.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.660
I'm really worried about Joe.

29:52.700 --> 29:57.700
He's just kind of wandering around, sitting down, head in his hands.

29:57.740 --> 30:00.500
I kind of think he's feeling sorry for himself, really,

30:00.540 --> 30:02.380
and he's obviously missing home.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.100
What's her name? Charlotte.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.980
SHE SIGHS

30:06.020 --> 30:08.140
Maximum three. You miss her, mate, don't you?

30:08.180 --> 30:09.620
So, he made it in two.

30:09.660 --> 30:11.860
SHE SIGHS

30:11.900 --> 30:13.660
Yeah.

30:13.700 --> 30:14.340
Yeah.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.100
Best thing that happened to me, though.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.060
How long have you been together? Five years.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.940
For the first time ever, since I met her,

30:19.980 --> 30:22.820
that I've gone 24 hours without speaking to her, so...

30:22.860 --> 30:24.980
In fact, you might...

30:25.020 --> 30:26.580
Come on, dude, hug it out!

30:28.740 --> 30:30.820
You'll be fine, mate, you'll be absolutely fine, honestly.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.380
You'll be fine, honestly.

30:32.420 --> 30:34.140
HE SIGHS

30:38.740 --> 30:41.060
If I don't have a good night's sleep fairly soon,

30:41.100 --> 30:43.300
I'm going to end up throttling someone inadvertently.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.260
I'm not joking.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.580
I'll lose my rag.

30:45.620 --> 30:46.900
I don't want a bed to sleep in.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.220
I'm not going to get soaking wet.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.340
SHE SIGHS

30:51.460 --> 30:54.580
The group are relying on their two builders, Andy and Paul,

30:54.620 --> 30:57.940
to construct a new watertight shelter.

30:57.980 --> 31:02.060
But both have a very different idea about where to put it.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.420
We need to pick a location to build this shelter on.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.460
Correct.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.460
We have two potential locations.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.260
Andy, is your place on the beach?

31:09.300 --> 31:10.260
Yeah.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.780
SHE SIGHS

31:11.820 --> 31:14.060
I can put any of these little bits of thicket and brush

31:14.060 --> 31:15.300
into it easily.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.660
Look, we've got a pit there for a fire pit.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.020
This is an absolutely perfect camp.

31:20.060 --> 31:21.700
Job's good.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.500
This is not Andy's, is it?

31:25.340 --> 31:28.140
You're more exposed to the tides, you're more exposed to the weather,

31:28.180 --> 31:31.100
and we're going to get bitten to smotherings by sandflies.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.060
It's not an option. No way.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.460
Andy's camp, it looks like it'll flood at the tidal surge,

31:36.500 --> 31:39.860
there's plastic bottles everywhere, I think we'll get bitten to shit.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.460
Pointless. Give me my opinion, mate.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.820
Fucking nobody listened to fucking me.

31:46.860 --> 31:50.020
I would love to have come down here for Andy's sake and gone,

31:50.060 --> 31:51.740
this is fucking brilliant, mate.

31:51.780 --> 31:54.460
But the trouble is, we walked in here and I kept my mouth shut,

31:54.500 --> 31:57.660
but within 30 seconds, everyone went, are you fucking joking?

31:57.700 --> 32:00.260
I'm a builder. People get me in to fix anything.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.460
Customers phone me up to put their IKEA bedroom stuff together.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.460
It's like, well, fuck you then.

32:05.500 --> 32:10.300
With Andy's site rejected, Paul shows the men his preferred location.

32:10.340 --> 32:13.260
Because it's elevated, this is not really going to be good.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.020
It's not really going to get that wet.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.900
It's got a fairly good canopy. We can all sleep here on the dry.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.420
Correct. You've got a nice little breeze coming through as well.

32:21.460 --> 32:22.420
Yeah, I like this place.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.380
Now, what do you want me to do, Paul?

32:25.420 --> 32:28.380
Well, what we need now are the cross members.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.900
I've bitched about Paul being a volcanic rhinoceros,

32:32.940 --> 32:35.420
but you know what, he's single-minded,

32:35.460 --> 32:38.420
but he makes clear decisions and sticks by them,

32:38.460 --> 32:41.900
and he's been right more than he's been wrong so far.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.940
Ah!

32:43.260 --> 32:47.300
We're fucking saved. We'll be all right now.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.300
We knew there was power on the island.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.580
How are you finding it?

32:54.620 --> 32:56.940
A bit shocked at how... Difficult.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.260
..how difficult it's been.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.860
We're all here doing the same shit.

32:59.900 --> 33:03.100
We're all not sure whether we should see it or not.

33:03.140 --> 33:07.100
Determined to boost Joe's morale and keep his mind off home,

33:07.140 --> 33:11.700
father of three, Vic, has asked him to join in with the shelter build.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.060
It's a challenge.

33:13.060 --> 33:16.020
We'll adapt to all this, quicker than any of us will.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.060
Far quicker.

33:18.260 --> 33:21.540
It's a case of making sure everybody guides everybody else

33:21.580 --> 33:23.020
in the right direction.

33:23.060 --> 33:26.980
I do firmly believe we will become an excellent team,

33:27.020 --> 33:31.180
er, to the point of becoming almost like a tribe.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.740
Can we just say, building camp at the top of a steep hill

33:39.780 --> 33:42.860
in the middle of rainy season is the stupidest idea

33:42.860 --> 33:43.860
we've ever had?

33:43.900 --> 33:44.940
Yeah.

33:44.980 --> 33:45.980
Ever had.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.820
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.420
And I'm obviously the weakest link.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.660
Joe, you're not the weakest link, you're just missing home.

33:52.700 --> 33:53.860
It's a natural thing to feel.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.980
I think some people do think I'm the weakest link, mate.

33:56.020 --> 33:56.980
Do you think that?

33:57.020 --> 33:57.980
I don't think so.

33:58.020 --> 33:58.980
No, but I think you do.

33:59.020 --> 33:59.980
Do you think so? Yeah.

34:00.020 --> 34:01.380
Crikey, what's made you think that?

34:01.420 --> 34:04.260
Day one when I met you, you've been shouting orders at me from day dot.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.260
Have I? No.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.900
We're carrying stuff in and out of a jungle

34:06.940 --> 34:08.740
and I've got a really heavy rucksack on my back

34:08.780 --> 34:10.940
and you're saying, Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do this.

34:10.980 --> 34:11.940
Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do that.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.180
I don't know if it happens to anyone else,

34:13.220 --> 34:14.420
but I think you feel that I'm the youngest,

34:14.460 --> 34:17.340
therefore, naturally, you've got some authority over me.

34:17.380 --> 34:20.140
And that's been grinding on me a little bit.

34:20.180 --> 34:25.180
Joe intimated that I'd been giving him a hard time,

34:25.220 --> 34:28.820
which I truly have only tried to be positive with everybody.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.180
I was devastated.

34:30.220 --> 34:31.500
You're being aggressive. I'm telling you what.

34:31.540 --> 34:34.260
You're being passive aggressive and that's not fair.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.420
All right?

34:35.460 --> 34:36.860
He just told me I'm being passive aggressive

34:36.900 --> 34:38.020
while we're having a laugh.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.620
I'm being passive aggressive.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.460
I'm being passive aggressive.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.900
I'm being passive aggressive, you know.

34:48.940 --> 34:53.860
However bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.660
Survival is about dogged determination,

34:56.700 --> 35:00.300
learning from your failures and never giving up.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.180
Churchill once said a great quote.

35:02.220 --> 35:05.580
He said, if you're going through hell, keep going.

35:07.300 --> 35:10.460
My balls are doing the backstroke in a bucket of sand.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.820
I'm hungry. I'm tired.

35:11.940 --> 35:15.940
All that's going through my head is, I don't self-arm at home,

35:15.940 --> 35:17.940
so why the hell am I self-arming out here?

35:19.940 --> 35:21.940
6am.

35:21.940 --> 35:26.940
I've never been in an environment where last night you hear a thunderstorm

35:26.940 --> 35:30.940
and it's now daylight and it's still thundering and it's still raining.

35:31.940 --> 35:35.940
Overnight, torrential rain has once again battered the island.

35:35.940 --> 35:40.940
The men have managed to protect the fire, but their spirits are low.

35:41.940 --> 35:45.940
It is a bit mind-boggling that you can have this much rain in so long.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.940
It just keeps coming.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.940
Yesterday, the men started work on a new shelter.

35:51.940 --> 35:55.940
But only half built, it was no match for the elements.

35:58.940 --> 36:01.940
I'm massively underestimated at this place. Massively.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.940
I'm so scared of hiking for as long as I can remember.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.940
Last night, when I got my first Hunger Rumble,

36:08.940 --> 36:10.940
it was playing on my mind a lot more.

36:11.940 --> 36:12.940
It's hard.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.940
This is apocalyptic weather.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.940
It's going to threaten to wash us out of this camp.

36:23.940 --> 36:27.940
For the third night in a row, the men have barely slept.

36:28.940 --> 36:30.940
The positive? It's daytime.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.940
I can see how crap it is.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.940
Here in the tropics, when it rains...

36:37.940 --> 36:40.940
It's not just nice British drizzle, it's torrential.

36:40.940 --> 36:42.940
We can hardly hold a conversation.

36:42.940 --> 36:46.940
You've got to spend so much time and energy trying to keep your fire alight

36:46.940 --> 36:49.940
when you could be out there fishing or hunting or making shelters.

36:49.940 --> 36:54.940
However strong and determined, after a while, it saps you.

36:54.940 --> 36:58.940
It saps your spirit in the same way it saps a life out of a fire.

37:00.940 --> 37:03.940
I cannot face another day on here. Honestly, I can't.

37:04.940 --> 37:08.940
I'm at the stage of almost a breakdown, to be totally honest.

37:08.940 --> 37:09.940
You just can't imagine.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.940
I can't imagine how tough it is.

37:12.940 --> 37:13.940
Unbelievable.

37:16.940 --> 37:19.940
The island's youngest member, Joe, says he's had enough.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.940
Four weeks, I think, would be a push for me.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.940
Six weeks, anything I'd ever make.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.940
The pain that I'm going to go through here,

37:28.940 --> 37:31.940
leaving the loved ones at home, Charlotte, all the rest of it...

37:31.940 --> 37:33.940
Then why did you sign up?

37:33.940 --> 37:34.940
I don't know.

37:39.940 --> 37:42.940
10am. The storm finally passes.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.940
Determined to leave as soon as possible,

37:47.940 --> 37:51.940
graphic designer Joe uses the emergency satellite radio

37:51.940 --> 37:53.940
to request an evacuation boat.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.940
I just really strongly believe that as a person,

37:58.940 --> 38:01.940
physically, mentally and all the rest of it,

38:01.940 --> 38:04.940
I'm not going to make the rest of the time on the island.

38:04.940 --> 38:07.940
And I've not made any rash decisions, cos I'm aware that you can make decisions

38:07.940 --> 38:08.940
in the heat of a moment.

38:08.940 --> 38:09.940
And I haven't.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.940
I just really fancy a margarita pizza.

38:13.940 --> 38:14.940
Joe wants to go home.

38:16.940 --> 38:17.940
I can't believe it.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.940
He's not been here four days.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.940
He's not even started and he wants to go home.

38:22.940 --> 38:25.940
Joe has agreed to stay on the island for another 24 hours

38:25.940 --> 38:29.940
before making a final decision about whether he wants to leave.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.940
You hold it up there, mark it and then we'll cut it.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.940
Is it long enough?

38:35.940 --> 38:36.940
No.

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
You can go halfway there.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.940
You can go halfway there.

38:39.940 --> 38:42.940
In the jungle, work continues on the shelter.

38:42.940 --> 38:45.940
Can you get that any higher?

38:45.940 --> 38:47.940
The group have persuaded Andy to help out,

38:47.940 --> 38:51.940
hoping the prospect of a dry night will encourage him to stay.

38:51.940 --> 38:52.940
One there.

38:52.940 --> 38:53.940
Yeah.

38:53.940 --> 38:54.940
And then one down here.

38:54.940 --> 38:55.940
Right, so not there then?

38:55.940 --> 38:56.940
Eh?

38:56.940 --> 38:57.940
So not there then?

38:57.940 --> 38:58.940
I didn't say to put it there.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.940
The whole reason I said I don't want to tie a sled knot in this piece

39:01.940 --> 39:04.940
is because we need to get the piece of wood in there first.

39:04.940 --> 39:09.940
Paul is a project manager in a construction company

39:09.940 --> 39:12.940
and Andy is a builder.

39:12.940 --> 39:14.940
Them two personalities just clash

39:14.940 --> 39:17.940
because one wants to tell the other one what to do

39:17.940 --> 39:20.940
and then this one wants to tell this one what to do.

39:20.940 --> 39:22.940
All we need to do is tie this on here, please.

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
That's all we need to do.

39:23.940 --> 39:24.940
Where's the bit of wood?

39:24.940 --> 39:27.940
Because I'm not tying a fucking knot if there ain't a bit of wood in it.

39:27.940 --> 39:28.940
Look, that ain't going nowhere.

39:28.940 --> 39:29.940
That's the shape I want.

39:29.940 --> 39:34.940
Andy really has a massive problem with me.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.940
Everybody's been tip-toeing around me for the past four days.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.940
It's just been a fucking prick.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.940
But what can you do?

39:43.940 --> 39:46.940
Something's just going to explode at some point.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.940
Since yesterday, Andy has been hinting

39:49.940 --> 39:53.940
that he too might request evacuation from the island.

39:53.940 --> 39:55.940
Why are you threatening to go home, Andy?

39:55.940 --> 39:57.940
All sorts of reasons, mate.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
Come on, spit us out.

39:58.940 --> 39:59.940
No, I don't need to.

39:59.940 --> 40:00.940
Why are you so aggressive?

40:00.940 --> 40:02.940
I'm asking you a simple question.

40:02.940 --> 40:03.940
Yeah, you've asked me it three times.

40:03.940 --> 40:04.940
The first time should have been enough.

40:04.940 --> 40:05.940
Then the second time.

40:05.940 --> 40:06.940
Now you're asking a fourth time.

40:06.940 --> 40:07.940
No, they were different questions.

40:07.940 --> 40:08.940
And then you're calling me aggressive

40:08.940 --> 40:11.940
because I don't want to answer a question that you've asked four times.

40:11.940 --> 40:12.940
I haven't asked it four times.

40:12.940 --> 40:13.940
You have.

40:13.940 --> 40:14.940
I said, why do you want to go home?

40:14.940 --> 40:15.940
You went, because I do.

40:15.940 --> 40:16.940
I went, well, give us a reason.

40:16.940 --> 40:17.940
You went, I'm not going to give you a reason.

40:17.940 --> 40:18.940
Exactly.

40:18.940 --> 40:19.940
So then you asked again.

40:19.940 --> 40:20.940
There must be a reason.

40:20.940 --> 40:21.940
And then you asked again.

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
I didn't ask again, Andy.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
You did.

40:23.940 --> 40:24.940
What is the fucking matter with you?

40:24.940 --> 40:26.940
Nothing the matter with me, son.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.940
At all.

40:29.940 --> 40:31.940
Do we wedge that there and then prop it up?

40:31.940 --> 40:33.940
Whatever Andy wants to do.

40:33.940 --> 40:34.940
I've had enough.

40:34.940 --> 40:35.940
Hang on.

40:35.940 --> 40:40.940
We need your expertise.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.940
I said, stop asking me.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.940
And he carried on asking me.

40:45.940 --> 40:50.940
Fucking unbelievable.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.940
With the camp's two builders walking off the job,

40:53.940 --> 40:56.940
construction of the shelter grinds to a halt.

40:56.940 --> 41:02.940
There's no doubt there's a lot of strong, pretty macho personalities on the men's island.

41:02.940 --> 41:05.940
And yeah, they're all trying to find their place in that pecking order.

41:05.940 --> 41:10.940
But the danger when you get these high pressure situations like this is that the alpha males

41:10.940 --> 41:13.940
start to compete instead of cooperate.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.940
And then the danger is it blows a whole group apart.

41:16.940 --> 41:17.940
I'm used to being in control.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.940
I'm used to being organized, everything running efficiently.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.940
It's what I do.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.940
That ignorant twat wants to do it his way.

41:25.940 --> 41:26.940
Yeah.

41:26.940 --> 41:27.940
I have no fucking clue.

41:27.940 --> 41:28.940
It makes your head.

41:28.940 --> 41:30.940
It's like it wants to implode.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.940
Seriously, my world is a punch to the throat.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.940
He's down.

41:33.940 --> 41:34.940
Gone.

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
Finished.

41:35.940 --> 41:36.940
It's over with.

41:36.940 --> 41:37.940
I walk away.

41:37.940 --> 41:38.940
Happy days.

41:38.940 --> 41:39.940
I can't do that here.

41:39.940 --> 41:40.940
Bang.

41:40.940 --> 41:41.940
Done.

41:41.940 --> 41:42.940
Fat cunt.

41:42.940 --> 41:43.940
You know what I mean?

41:43.940 --> 41:50.940
There's a lot of bad blood in camp at the minute, largely between Paul and Andy.

41:50.940 --> 41:55.940
We've got enough on our plate in this island without alpha male dick swinging.

41:55.940 --> 41:59.940
I think everyone just needs to man the fuck up, really.

41:59.940 --> 42:06.940
I just feel like everything I do, mate, he's just there, ready to fucking knock it down,

42:06.940 --> 42:07.940
you know, or criticize.

42:07.940 --> 42:09.940
It's like, fuck off, you know?

42:09.940 --> 42:11.940
If he goes, I'll stay.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.940
People might make problems.

42:13.940 --> 42:23.940
So I overheard a conversation with Andy.

42:23.940 --> 42:24.940
His exact words were,

42:24.940 --> 42:28.940
if Paul leaves, that would be good because then I will stay.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.940
I'm not dealing with that sort of immaturity.

42:30.940 --> 42:32.940
He's supposed to be a grown man.

42:32.940 --> 42:33.940
I'm not being blackmailed.

42:33.940 --> 42:36.940
I don't need to be surrounded by this immaturity.

42:36.940 --> 42:38.940
I might just have to go.

42:38.940 --> 42:40.940
Are you thinking about fucking off?

42:40.940 --> 42:42.940
Can't be fucking bothered.

42:42.940 --> 42:43.940
Mate, you can't go, mate.

42:43.940 --> 42:44.940
You literally can't go.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.940
Do you think that you would regret it later on?

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
You will regret it.

42:48.940 --> 42:49.940
I think I won't.

42:49.940 --> 42:50.940
Just suck it up, mate.

42:50.940 --> 42:51.940
Lift up your skirt.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.940
Wash the sand out of your vagina, mate.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.940
In a disastrous turn of events,

42:57.940 --> 43:00.940
three men, including the island's two builders,

43:00.940 --> 43:02.940
are now threatening to walk.

43:03.940 --> 43:09.940
Andy, Paul and Joe all want to leave this island.

43:09.940 --> 43:12.940
I'm amazed that they've come this far

43:12.940 --> 43:14.940
and want to give up so early.

43:21.940 --> 43:23.940
As yet another storm hits the island,

43:23.940 --> 43:25.940
the men call a crisis meeting.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.940
I know it sounds cutthroat,

43:28.940 --> 43:31.940
but we need to keep as many of those guys here as we can.

43:31.940 --> 43:33.940
But for any of them to change their mind is a win.

43:35.940 --> 43:38.940
There's been so much discussion about people leaving.

43:38.940 --> 43:42.940
My personal opinion is that we are stronger together

43:42.940 --> 43:43.940
than we are apart.

43:43.940 --> 43:44.940
Agreed.

43:44.940 --> 43:46.940
Joe, my hope is that you might have thought differently...

43:46.940 --> 43:47.940
We've already done this.

43:47.940 --> 43:48.940
I've already had the chat with everyone.

43:48.940 --> 43:49.940
People have already said their thoughts.

43:49.940 --> 43:51.940
I've already said my thoughts, but...

43:51.940 --> 43:52.940
On that note,

43:52.940 --> 43:53.940
I will be saying no more.

43:53.940 --> 43:56.940
I'll just be waiting for the boat to arrive and to leave, OK?

43:58.940 --> 44:00.940
Paul, would you just let us know

44:00.940 --> 44:02.940
how you're feeling at the moment?

44:02.940 --> 44:04.940
I came to this island as a bit of a release,

44:04.940 --> 44:07.940
you know, to get away from my everyday life.

44:08.940 --> 44:10.940
I'm not really confrontational.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.940
I don't like having arguments with people.

44:12.940 --> 44:15.940
I'd rather just step away from the situation.

44:15.940 --> 44:18.940
The final nail in the coffin was to hear somebody say

44:18.940 --> 44:21.940
that it was good that I was going,

44:21.940 --> 44:23.940
which I thought was a bit of a shame,

44:23.940 --> 44:27.940
but in another way, it confirmed my decision.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.940
And in that case, that's why I decided to go.

44:30.940 --> 44:32.940
If one goes, there's no point in the other going.

44:32.940 --> 44:33.940
Right, here we go.

44:33.940 --> 44:34.940
How we make that decision...

44:34.940 --> 44:35.940
Here we go.

44:35.940 --> 44:37.940
This is now we're getting to the country.

44:37.940 --> 44:40.940
He's segregated himself from the group from day one.

44:40.940 --> 44:42.940
We're having a discussion, he doesn't want to know.

44:42.940 --> 44:44.940
We haven't got any beds, he makes himself a bed.

44:44.940 --> 44:46.940
He goes off in socks.

44:46.940 --> 44:47.940
Somehow, that's my fault.

44:47.940 --> 44:49.940
I've had no sleep the whole day.

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
Neither has anybody.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.940
You've been sleeping.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.940
Sorry, mate, you've been sleeping.

44:54.940 --> 44:56.940
Andy, nobody's had any sleep.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.940
As a group, no-one here has had enough sleep

44:58.940 --> 45:01.940
to give them the energy to do what they're about to do the next day.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.940
So you pointing a finger at me and saying,

45:03.940 --> 45:06.940
well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.

45:06.940 --> 45:08.940
I've been having a laugh up until I heard

45:08.940 --> 45:11.940
one of my team-mates say they wanted me to go.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.940
I was having a right crack.

45:13.940 --> 45:14.940
Now I'm not.

45:14.940 --> 45:17.940
In a community, not everyone gets on,

45:17.940 --> 45:19.940
and that is a fact of life.

45:19.940 --> 45:21.940
We can't change that.

45:21.940 --> 45:23.940
So let's build our community.

45:23.940 --> 45:26.940
You and you, just keep your distance.

45:26.940 --> 45:27.940
At least we're together.

45:27.940 --> 45:29.940
We're two men up.

45:29.940 --> 45:30.940
We can build a shelter in a day

45:30.940 --> 45:32.940
rather than taking two days with two men down.

45:32.940 --> 45:34.940
The big strong man and the builder.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.940
If you two fuck off, then we're fucked, aren't we?

45:37.940 --> 45:39.940
See, I don't want to lose two builders,

45:39.940 --> 45:41.940
regardless of your characters.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.940
We need you to stay.

45:43.940 --> 45:46.940
I'm going to walk away, and then that would hopefully...

45:46.940 --> 45:47.940
No, listen.

45:47.940 --> 45:49.940
So Andy can engage.

45:49.940 --> 45:52.940
Enjoy his experience, and hopefully five.

45:52.940 --> 45:54.940
Then you're not losing two people, are you?

45:54.940 --> 45:55.940
You're losing one.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.940
I'm leaving the island.

45:57.940 --> 45:58.940
Whether Paul leaves or not.

45:58.940 --> 45:59.940
Whether Paul leaves or not.

45:59.940 --> 46:02.940
I would rather Paul stay.

46:02.940 --> 46:04.940
He's a stronger man than me.

46:04.940 --> 46:06.940
He'll be more benefit to you.

46:06.940 --> 46:09.940
But either way, I'm sorry, I'm going.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.940
For him to fucking say, I'm glad he's going, good,

46:12.940 --> 46:14.940
then I'll stay, then all of a sudden

46:14.940 --> 46:16.940
he hasn't got his own way again,

46:16.940 --> 46:18.940
and it's, oh, I'm going, there's other reasons.

46:18.940 --> 46:20.940
It's fucking immaturity.

46:20.940 --> 46:22.940
It's sulking, and it's attention-seeking.

46:22.940 --> 46:24.940
And you don't want to be scapegoated, I realise this.

46:24.940 --> 46:26.940
Pollocks, absolute pollocks. I'm not having it.

46:26.940 --> 46:28.940
I am going off this island,

46:28.940 --> 46:31.940
because I'm not being held responsible for that.

46:31.940 --> 46:32.940
End of story.

46:35.940 --> 46:37.940
Next time on The Women's Island...

46:37.940 --> 46:39.940
Oh, my God!

46:39.940 --> 46:41.940
A huge fucking snake came towards me!

46:41.940 --> 46:44.940
Fucking hell!

46:44.940 --> 46:46.940
At the minute, we are barely coping

46:46.940 --> 46:48.940
with the situation in which we find ourselves.

46:48.940 --> 46:50.940
Oh, shit, no, wait, sit forward.

46:50.940 --> 46:52.940
We have nothing to drink.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.940
We don't know where we are.

46:54.940 --> 46:56.940
Hello!

47:18.940 --> 47:21.940
