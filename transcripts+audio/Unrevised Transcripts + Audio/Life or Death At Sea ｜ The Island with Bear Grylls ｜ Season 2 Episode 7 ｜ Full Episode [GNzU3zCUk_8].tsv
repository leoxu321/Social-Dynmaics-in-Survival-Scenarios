104900	114620	three weeks ago fourteen British men
114620	114640	three weeks ago fourteen British men
114640	116920	three weeks ago fourteen British men were cast away on this remote Pacific
116920	116940	were cast away on this remote Pacific
116940	119840	were cast away on this remote Pacific Island
119840	119900	Pacific Island
120000	122000	Living on the edge of existence...
122000	125000	OK, Vic, go now, go now. Right, that's it.
125000	127000	..until 47-year-old Vic...
127000	130000	Here we go, puppy dogs!
130000	132000	..led them to capture and kill...
132000	133000	Bullshit!
133000	135000	..the island's number-one predator.
135000	138000	We've just caught a prehistoric animal!
139000	141000	But despite their best efforts,
141000	144000	they've not been able to repeat the success.
144000	146000	Truck empty.
146000	149000	The onset of starvation looks upon us.
149000	152000	And feast has turned to famine.
152000	155000	Hey, look, you can see Piers's heart beating through his chest.
155000	157000	Boys, there's no meat on you.
157000	159000	I think we're going to run into some really hard times
159000	161000	in the next couple of weeks, and we'll see.
161000	164000	It'll test everybody's mettle, mine as much as anybody else.
169000	171000	Guys, there's a snake here.
171000	173000	Keep track of it, we're coming.
174000	176000	OK, Bonnie.
176000	178000	Knock it off.
179000	183000	Oh, my gosh.
183000	185000	Bonnie, you've become a killer.
185000	189000	It's food, but I take no pleasure from doing that whatsoever.
189000	193000	It's the second bloody animal I've ever headed since being here.
193000	195000	Killer.
195000	198000	In the four days since the men caught and ate the crocodile,
198000	201000	they've had to survive on slim pickings.
202000	204000	Oh, hello.
204000	206000	It's eaten... It's a little bird or something.
206000	207000	..a baby bird!
207000	208000	Look at that.
208000	210000	Oh!
210000	211000	A bird and a snake.
211000	212000	Get him on the fire too.
212000	213000	Yeah, man.
213000	214000	He's been there.
214000	216000	It's like snake crisps.
217000	219000	It's very, like, pork-scratching.
224000	225000	Oh, man, guilt.
225000	228000	Apart from the odd, opportunistic kill,
228000	231000	the only man who's been able to provide anything
231000	235000	like a regular supply of food for the group is 47-year-old Vic.
235000	236000	Woo!
236000	237000	Hoo!
238000	240000	Look at the size of that bitch!
240000	241000	Woo!
242000	245000	If I didn't have another mouse to feed, I would live like a king.
245000	247000	There's no two ways about that.
247000	249000	It's a shame nobody else is raking food in,
249000	250000	cos that would be helpful.
252000	254000	If he wants to go out and catch amazing fish
254000	256000	and keeps me fed every night, I'm not going to stop the guy.
259000	261000	But even with Vic's contributions,
261000	264000	the men are burning far more calories than they're consuming.
264000	266000	I'm slowly evaporating.
268000	270000	Soon to disappear down the plughole.
272000	274000	What happens in these periods of starvation
274000	277000	is that the body starts to eat into its own fat reserves
277000	279000	and key muscle groups, like your legs,
279000	282000	that you desperately need in a survival situation.
282000	286000	And then, over time, as the brain also gets starved of nutrients,
286000	289000	that decline becomes mental as well as physical,
289000	292000	and that then affects your ability to make smart,
292000	294000	rational decisions.
298000	300000	Yeah, that's new, that's fresh.
300000	302000	This is dry as a bone, this stuff.
302000	304000	We got it? Got it.
304000	305000	Got it.
305000	309000	Every day, the men face a round of essential back-breaking chores.
310000	311000	I feel pretty tired.
311000	314000	Which leave them little time or energy for hunting.
315000	317000	With no food to sustain them,
317000	319000	the group's cook, Sam Brown,
319000	321000	is doing his best to feed the fish.
322000	325000	He's doing his best to rustle up an edible lunch
325000	329000	from leftover fish bits, crocodile bones and limpets.
329000	331000	Put the stew on, we're boiling the bones down,
331000	334000	we're going to save the big bones so we can make a stock.
334000	337000	I'm trying to feed 11 people in the next hour or two hours.
339000	341000	A lot of the cooking has fallen on my shoulders.
341000	343000	I'd rather do it and do it well
343000	345000	than watch someone else it up and go hungry
345000	348000	or I have to pick fish scales out of my food.
349000	351000	Oh, for f***'s sake, guys.
353000	354000	What?
354000	356000	F***ing filled with limpet guts.
358000	362000	We've got 11 bowls, three of which have been used as spittoons.
362000	365000	That's overnight rotting limpet guts.
368000	370000	That's disgusting and that's going to give us diarrhea,
370000	373000	vomiting, that's going to get you off the island really fast.
373000	375000	Somebody needs to be on washing up detail.
375000	377000	We'll wash all them? Yeah.
377000	379000	They don't wash themselves, boys.
381000	383000	I think what you just said, they're a little bit unfair there, Sam.
383000	385000	I'll talk to them when we get back. No, no, why didn't you do it?
385000	387000	Do what? Why didn't you take them down and wash them?
387000	389000	Cos I'm washing the fire and I'm cooking the soup.
391000	393000	That's not a massive, hard task, though, is it?
393000	395000	Well, if that soup pot falls over... We're all staffed.
395000	397000	We're all f***ed. It's not a physically hard task, though, is it?
397000	399000	That's all I'm going at. It's not a physically hard task.
399000	401000	Some of us are really working really hard.
401000	403000	We're all sweating our balls off.
403000	406000	We are. OK, mate, cook a pot of soup and we'll talk.
406000	408000	That's all I'm saying.
409000	412000	There are one or two people that are fantastic at
412000	414000	avoiding what they're meant to do
414000	416000	and looking busy doing very little.
416000	419000	I kind of think, like, if a tree falls in the forest
419000	421000	and Vic's not there to hear it, it doesn't count.
421000	423000	Like, only work that he does
423000	426000	or work that people do right next to him counts.
426000	428000	F*** that shit.
428000	431000	The men on the island, they're spending every waking hour
431000	433000	in each other's company,
433000	436000	and they get no respite from the intensity of that soup.
436000	439000	And in many ways, it's little surprise
439000	442000	that they're starting to turn on each other.
444000	446000	OK.
446000	448000	This should be good.
448000	450000	After a morning of hard labour,
450000	453000	the hungry men sit down, hoping to enjoy Sam's soup.
455000	457000	God, it smells funky, doesn't it?
457000	458000	Smells like crap.
458000	460000	There is some distinct smell of poo about this.
460000	462000	Smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it? Yeah.
464000	465000	I just couldn't swallow it.
465000	466000	I literally couldn't swallow it.
466000	468000	It almost made me puke.
476000	478000	After a barely edible lunch,
478000	481000	Vic is determined to have a decent dinner.
481000	483000	I might fish.
483000	484000	What choice do I have?
484000	487000	I don't want to eat limpets again, they're crap.
487000	489000	I'll eat them, but they're crap.
491000	493000	Flagging after their morning chores,
493000	496000	the rest of the men decide to stay behind and camp.
496000	498000	Everything's an effort.
501000	502000	That's how I feel right now.
502000	504000	Knackered, boys.
504000	506000	Absolutely knackered.
506000	508000	Completely knackered.
512000	514000	Nobody asks me to go fishing,
514000	517000	but they know I'll go fishing to get food.
517000	519000	And I know they're doing the daily chores,
519000	522000	but guys just aren't going that extra yard.
522000	524000	Come on, boys.
524000	527000	Once you've finished your duties or you don't have much of a duty,
527000	529000	that ain't end of the day, is it?
533000	538000	I am prejudiced against everybody that isn't me,
538000	543000	because if you all did it my way, it'd be a much better place.
545000	548000	But I provide for my family.
548000	550000	I'm a good father.
550000	551000	I'm a good husband.
551000	552000	I'm a good husband, I hope.
552000	554000	I hope I'm an excellent lover.
554000	555000	I don't know.
555000	557000	I'm going to cope without speaking to my wife and kids
557000	559000	for that length of time.
559000	560000	I've no idea.
560000	561000	I really don't know.
561000	562000	No idea.
562000	563000	Gives me goosebumps.
563000	564000	Not sure.
566000	569000	Dude, you are an absolute fish-tickling bastard, aren't you?
569000	570000	Late afternoon.
570000	572000	Do you want a hamburger?
572000	574000	After four hours of fishing,
574000	578000	Vic has single-handedly provided dinner for the rest of the men.
578000	580000	That is so hard.
580000	581000	I'm fucked.
581000	583000	Nobody been and got any coconut, no?
583000	584000	No.
590000	591000	It's getting harder and harder every day,
591000	593000	coming back and seeing everybody laid on fucking beach
593000	594000	and I'm catching fish.
594000	595000	No, I'm all right.
595000	596000	I don't need to sit down.
596000	597000	I need coconut.
597000	598000	I need water.
598000	600000	Coconuts we're getting tomorrow.
600000	601000	Fucking hell.
601000	603000	I thought we were going out for coconut or something.
603000	606000	How difficult would it be for two or three lads to go across
606000	608000	and get a bag full of coconuts?
608000	609000	Do you want me to do that as well?
609000	611000	Do you want me to do that as well?
614000	617000	Fed up of the group taking him for granted,
617000	619000	Vic's made a big decision.
620000	621000	Bollocks to it.
621000	622000	I'm not fishing any more.
622000	624000	Somebody else go fishing.
624000	626000	I might have a couple of days off.
626000	628000	See how everybody fares then.
628000	631000	If somebody else has turned to step up to the plate.
631000	633000	Wowzers.
633000	635000	You've done incredibly well, Vic.
635000	636000	Yeah, you really have, mate.
636000	637000	You've done it absolutely brilliantly.
637000	639000	You absolutely nailed it.
639000	640000	Thanks so much.
640000	642000	I have a couple of things to say,
642000	644000	and I'm unsure whether to say them now,
644000	645000	cos I don't want to spoil the atmosphere,
645000	647000	or save them till the end of the night.
647000	648000	So, do I do them now?
648000	649000	Say them now.
649000	650000	Say them now?
650000	651000	Let's have them now.
651000	652000	OK.
652000	654000	Today, I spent fishing all day on my own.
654000	656000	But we're all sat round here,
656000	658000	happy as pigs in shit, eating, though, now,
658000	660000	and I went without a buddy.
660000	662000	Perhaps you shouldn't have gone without a buddy.
662000	664000	But if I hadn't have gone when I went,
664000	666000	we wouldn't all be eating.
667000	669000	I certainly don't want to be busting a gut
669000	672000	and come back to see people kipping, pampering,
672000	674000	tossing it off, doing whatever.
674000	676000	It's not fair. It's not fair.
676000	677000	That's top and bottom of it.
677000	679000	It's not fair.
679000	681000	It's a very good point, Vic.
681000	682000	It is.
682000	683000	And I'm glad you've raised it.
683000	685000	So, I'll put my rods down,
685000	687000	you'll fish for your own snap,
687000	689000	and I'll eat limpets like restiers.
690000	692000	The group's most skilled hunter
692000	694000	has gone on fishing strike.
695000	696000	That's it?
696000	697000	Fish out.
697000	698000	OK?
698000	699000	Yeah, that's fair.
699000	700000	Understood.
700000	702000	The burden of finding food
702000	704000	will now fall on the rest of the men.
706000	708000	We are knackered.
710000	711000	We are screwed.
711000	714000	We have relied solely on fish,
714000	715000	rod catching,
715000	717000	most of them from Vic.
717000	719000	But tomorrow, I'm a bit worried,
719000	721000	cos I'm not sure the guys are going to cope.
723000	724000	It scares me.
727000	734000	I think everyone's feeling a little bit sluggish today,
734000	735000	aren't they?
735000	737000	Yeah, I know what you mean.
737000	738000	7am.
738000	742000	Dan and Sam Brown are on the early morning water run.
743000	746000	How are you feeling after your little debate yesterday?
746000	747000	Oh, with Vic?
747000	748000	Yeah.
748000	749000	Pretty good?
751000	753000	I think Vic was just maybe
753000	755000	trying to pick a bit of a fight yesterday.
755000	756000	Yeah.
756000	757000	He likes to push buttons.
758000	759000	I think he likes to niggle.
759000	760000	He likes a little...
760000	761000	Yeah.
761000	762000	You know, he sort of...
762000	763000	He has this sort of, like,
763000	765000	oh, I'm nice as pie, da-da-da.
765000	766000	Fuck off, he is.
767000	768000	Where's my hat?
769000	771000	Last night, 47-year-old Vic,
771000	773000	the group's most successful hunter,
773000	776000	announced that he was going on fishing strike.
777000	778000	I'm absolutely knackered.
778000	779000	Are you?
779000	780000	Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.
780000	782000	Just trudging out, catching fish and trudging back
782000	784000	day after day after day after day after day.
784000	785000	It's not fair.
785000	788000	How many fishing lines have you hooked up before, Phil?
788000	789000	None.
790000	792000	The burden of finding a fish supper
792000	794000	now lies with the other men.
794000	796000	There is absolutely no food in this camp.
796000	797000	There is no reserve.
797000	799000	There's no larder that we have here at the moment.
799000	802000	So if we don't catch anything today, we don't eat.
802000	805000	Right, so where are the points to go fishing?
805000	807000	Although refusing to fish himself,
807000	809000	Vic doesn't want to go hungry,
809000	811000	so he offers the men some advice.
811000	812000	Get your fish.
812000	815000	So he offers the men some advice.
815000	818000	Get your hook and push it through the limb pit at the top.
818000	819000	OK.
819000	823000	Then turn the limb pit and come back through the soft gel.
823000	824000	Feel, feel, feel.
824000	825000	Boom.
825000	828000	But if hidden on it, I would say just hidden
828000	829000	and right on the edge.
829000	830000	Yeah.
830000	831000	Cos they nibble on the edge
831000	833000	and they want them to just nibble it and get caught.
833000	835000	You undermine me every time when I start telling about stuff
835000	836000	and it's rude.
836000	837000	Please don't do it.
837000	838000	Sorry, Vic.
838000	839000	OK?
839000	840000	I thought I was adding to you.
840000	841000	No.
841000	843000	So if you put two limb pits on...
843000	845000	He was very quick to swipe at me
845000	848000	and I think maybe Vic has lost perspective a little bit.
848000	852000	He thinks that he's the kingpin
852000	855000	and that he is providing more than anyone else
855000	857000	and doing more than everyone else.
857000	859000	I don't know if he feels he needs to contribute,
859000	861000	so if we all think he's contributed or...
861000	863000	I don't know, but it's rude.
863000	864000	He shouldn't do it.
871000	879000	I'm thinking three, maybe four bottles around each pole
879000	881000	and then just like that all the way along.
881000	883000	We are going to adapt and overcome.
885000	888000	36-year-old Will has come up with an ambitious plan
888000	891000	to fish the deeper waters surrounding the island.
893000	895000	We've got to make a raft
895000	897000	so we can get in the middle of the channel,
897000	899000	massive hook, big fish bait.
899000	900000	I would love to have a tuna.
900000	902000	That would be the best day ever.
902000	904000	Imagine that.
904000	905000	Sashimi.
908000	911000	We don't have any oil drums or anything.
911000	913000	What we've got on this island
913000	917000	is shedloads of empty plastic bottles.
919000	921000	Fingers crossed she'll float.
921000	922000	Right.
922000	924000	Let's get cracking.
925000	928000	While he waits for the men to find him food,
928000	929000	Vic takes the opportunity
929000	932000	to make a bed for himself.
932000	933000	So unlike the others,
933000	936000	he'll be protected from critters on the jungle floor.
936000	938000	Look at that natural twine.
939000	941000	What an absolute biscuit.
943000	945000	Yeah, I'm happy with this so far.
945000	947000	I don't have a double bed, I'm afraid,
947000	950000	so I can't interest my wife in sleeping with me this evening.
951000	953000	So I'm just going to single it up.
953000	956000	Having isolated himself from the other men,
956000	958000	Vic's thoughts are increasingly turning to family.
960000	963000	I had a very unnerving dream last night about home,
963000	965000	which was very horrible.
965000	968000	It woke me up in not such a pleasant mood.
968000	970000	I'm missing home desperately.
970000	973000	I keep thinking more and more about my wife and kids every day.
975000	978000	I could do with a kiss and a cuddle off my missus,
978000	980000	squeeze the life out of a blesser.
989000	992000	It's time to get to work.
992000	994480	I'm
994480	995480	ready to go.
1005000	1009000	Will's raft is ready to set sail.
1009000	1011000	I came up with the idea,
1011000	1013000	I shall name this raft
1013000	1016000	after my two gorgeous daughters, Freya and Pippa.
1016000	1017000	Shall we call it Fripster?
1017000	1018000	Nice, mate.
1019000	1021000	I'll get it, guys.
1021040	1024480	It looks like a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks,
1024520	1027680	because it is a bunch of bottles attached to some flanks.
1027720	1032920	But our livelihood and our dependency on food relies on it.
1032960	1034720	So go on, Fripster.
1034760	1036840	Fingers crossed we're in orbit launch.
1036880	1038760	Get some fish.
1038800	1042440	I name this boat Fripster the First.
1042480	1045800	Long may she catch us fish from the deep.
1045840	1048680	Right, on we get.
1048680	1050240	Are you ready?
1050280	1053720	You're sailing the Fripster Road.
1053760	1055800	Come on, lads.
1055840	1057680	See you in two weeks.
1057720	1060040	Bye.
1060080	1062200	She floats!
1062240	1064000	She floats!
1064040	1068120	I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivor's arsenal
1068160	1071840	is resourcefulness, being able to look at an everyday object
1071880	1076760	and think of clever, ingenious ways of using it to help you.
1076800	1077920	The risks are big,
1077920	1081600	but the spoils could be even bigger if that raft succeeds.
1081640	1083040	Bigger strokes, mate.
1083080	1084280	Reach.
1084320	1086920	After a huge joint effort from all the men,
1086960	1090200	apart from Vic, the raft appears to be a success.
1095040	1099280	Most of the group are now out trying to catch supper.
1099320	1103800	I've not got the patience for fishing, I tell you that for nothing.
1103840	1107840	Leaving the gruelling job of firewood to Vic, an IT consultant,
1107840	1109280	Kyle.
1109320	1113120	Kyle, why do we need a shitload more kindling today than we have done?
1113160	1114440	It's not heavy stuff, is it?
1114480	1116440	Yeah.
1116480	1119240	Kyle's still quite gifted at doing very little.
1119280	1120800	But that's the problem with intelligent people,
1120840	1123520	because they think they're cleverer than the people
1123560	1125160	that they're out doing the job for.
1125200	1127080	They think they can out-think them.
1127120	1129280	When it comes to manual labour, Jesus Christ, lads,
1129320	1130360	stop getting all crazy.
1130400	1132760	It's manual labour, which is every job we've got.
1135600	1137640	I think on this island there will be people that come off,
1137640	1141800	physically bollocks, regardless of diet, whether we eat or we don't eat,
1141840	1144240	and there'll be guys come off who aren't.
1144280	1147240	And if we're not all hanging out of our arse at the end of this,
1147280	1149240	somebody hasn't been working hard enough, have they?
1149280	1150640	Would you agree with that?
1150680	1152680	No, it could happen where we're not all spent.
1152720	1155160	We work hard as a team, we achieve a lot,
1155200	1158440	and at the end, we're not all sort of hanging out of our arses.
1158480	1160640	That could happen. What the fuck are you talking about?
1160680	1162640	I'm talking English. I'm just talking English.
1162680	1164640	I'm uneducated, you have to lower it down to my level.
1164680	1167120	What, didn't you understand? The term we use in Yorkshire,
1167120	1169760	layman's terms, every job is a manual job.
1169800	1172200	Do we agree? Yeah. Yeah.
1172240	1175320	So, if we all plough into that 100% manually,
1175360	1177480	we will all be bollocksed at the end of this journey.
1177520	1179720	I've already said I don't think at the end of this...
1179760	1181360	Right, then, let me just say it again, then.
1181400	1183720	All it goes on about is this is a physical place,
1183760	1185640	every task in here is physical.
1185680	1188120	Whoop-de-doo. You know, that's brilliant,
1188160	1191680	but we're not all just grunts that have been sent out here
1191720	1193120	to bash on bits of wood.
1193160	1194960	You can talk your way around whatever you want,
1195000	1196880	top and bottom of it is, it's a physical island,
1196880	1200200	every job is physical, we should all be bollocksed.
1200240	1202320	If not, somebody's carrying somebody else.
1205880	1207280	That's the top and bottom of it.
1222400	1224760	Mid-afternoon.
1224800	1226760	Still reeling from yesterday's argument
1226760	1230240	with Vic, Sam Brown is trying to catch some dinner.
1232280	1237200	Vic keeps making little remarks to me that just make me seethe.
1237240	1239000	So, what was getting his goat this morning?
1239040	1240880	Oh, mate, a whole load of things.
1240920	1242000	If we can catch some fish...
1242040	1244000	Hopefully, Vic will be in a slightly better mood.
1245680	1247640	After three hours on the water,
1247680	1250280	Barney and Sam haven't had a single bite.
1252400	1254600	So, what are you thinking with this rod?
1254640	1255920	I'm thinking, I don't know,
1255960	1256640	maybe they always...
1256640	1258960	They always say, patience is a virtue, don't they?
1259000	1263080	And I'm quite impatient.
1265120	1266520	Is that line tight?
1266560	1267920	No.
1267960	1269040	No, no bite.
1270760	1272760	Oh, fuck it, let's go in.
1278400	1281960	With nightfall approaching, the other men also return to camp.
1283520	1286200	Vic is waiting to see how many fish they have caught
1286200	1287200	in his absence.
1288960	1290880	No joy, fella?
1290920	1294600	No, I had a nice day fishing, as you'd say, Vic.
1294640	1295960	Not catching.
1296000	1298240	Old dogs should learn new tricks.
1298280	1300360	Listen when I tell him.
1300400	1301080	Did you not listen?
1301120	1302120	No.
1304920	1308600	Four hours fishing and one poxy trigger.
1308640	1311880	I fucking hate fishing.
1311920	1316080	It's exhausting just standing there in the sun
1316080	1319040	for X amount of hours.
1323640	1325520	Charlie caught a fish.
1325560	1327320	Well, that ain't feeding nobody, is it?
1327360	1329120	That ain't feeding Jack shit.
1330840	1332280	It's just limpets again.
1333760	1336880	The men's attempts to provide dinner without Vic's help
1336920	1338520	have been a miserable failure.
1341040	1342720	Desperation corner over here.
1342760	1343840	Mm-hm.
1343880	1345880	The pressure is on me to feed everybody.
1345880	1349040	It's almost as though I am expected to grab a rod
1349080	1352200	and go out and catch fish so everybody else can eat.
1352240	1354720	And that ain't good. I don't like that.
1354760	1357040	See you in the morning, ladies.
1357080	1361480	With no food in camp, Vic opts for an early night in his new bed.
1361520	1363760	You on the beach, sir?
1363800	1364800	Oh, dear.
1369840	1371520	Oh, yeah.
1371560	1373400	Let me get myself ready for bed.
1373440	1374480	Oh, dear.
1374520	1375400	Oh, dear.
1375400	1377320	Oh, dear, God, yeah, that's lovely.
1377360	1378360	That is...
1378400	1380160	He has to remember that we are a team here
1380200	1383360	and with certain things, he is quite selfish.
1383400	1386120	Does not get any better, does it?
1386160	1389600	For a family man, I might have expected him to be
1389640	1391680	more considerate of others.
1391720	1392840	Oh!
1394720	1397320	Oh, boys, you don't know what you're missing!

1406880	1408160	MUSIC FADES
1408200	1412880	While on fishing strike, 47-year-old Vic has built himself a raised bed.
1412920	1414640	MUSIC FADES
1414680	1416360	Mm, yeah, that was a good night's sleep.
1416400	1418680	I had some lovely dreams.
1418720	1421800	For some reason, one of us knew Jonathan Ross
1421840	1424160	and we ended up in his house,
1424200	1427320	trying to catch his fish out of his fish tank.
1427360	1428360	Can't think why.
1430480	1432440	Oh!
1432480	1434000	Oh, I love my bed.
1434920	1436960	Protected from the jungle critters,
1437000	1439040	Vic has had his best sleep yet.
1439080	1440280	WHISTLE BLOWS
1445040	1447440	While the others have had their worst.
1449080	1452880	Oh, my legs are a bit into shit, my arms are a bit into shit.
1454120	1456120	Sleeping rough on the jungle floor,
1456160	1459960	the men have been attacked overnight by a swarm of sandflies.
1460000	1461640	They're everywhere, covered in them.
1461680	1464680	They must have, you know, 500 bites or so.
1464920	1467040	I'm just not having a good reaction to them.
1467080	1469040	And they're starting to swell up.
1469080	1471080	You may think on a desert island,
1471120	1474680	your real enemies are the crocs, the scorpions, the snakes,
1474720	1478080	but actually it's often the little things you can't see.
1478120	1480120	And worse of these are sandflies.
1480160	1483120	They're super itchy, ten times worse than a mosquito.
1483160	1485760	You scratch away, it's hot, it's humid,
1485800	1488400	and that's when the bites can become infected.
1492480	1494760	They have had a monster.
1494920	1496920	It's a massive gore.
1496960	1497960	Oh!
1499920	1500920	Oh!
1502120	1506600	This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in
1506640	1508080	or eat you alive.
1515480	1517880	Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.
1520600	1523000	Reeling from last night's infestation,
1523040	1524880	the men call an emergency meeting.
1524960	1527960	I've got to put my hands up and say my insulated bones are so bad,
1528000	1528960	I can barely walk.
1529000	1531960	I can't even walk, I can't even go in the sun.
1532000	1533960	So I'm happy to chop wood and stuff in here,
1534000	1535960	but if I go in the sun, my legs just flare up
1536000	1536960	and I can't even move them.
1537000	1540960	Tomorrow I might be down, but today is absolutely excruciating.
1541000	1544960	It's like someone's puffing fire into my calves when I move them.
1545000	1546960	My worry with these bites,
1547000	1549960	cos they just seem to be, like, escalating a notch,
1550000	1550960	like, that's...
1551000	1552960	I worry that, what with all the rain,
1553000	1554760	some other kind of bug might come up,
1554760	1558000	a bug might have hatched and might be starting to feast on us.
1558040	1559800	Today, priorities.
1559840	1562240	I think we just concentrate on just trying to get
1562280	1564080	as many of these beds up as possible.
1565920	1570760	Raised beds are the group's best protection against further attacks.
1570800	1572800	Right, are you ready? Cos this one might jump.
1575640	1577720	Having built his own yesterday,
1577760	1582320	Vic temporarily ends his work to rule to lend a helping hand.
1582360	1584640	I think all of us, there's a full team of 11,
1584640	1587600	get stuck into beds, everybody's bed.
1587640	1588600	Come on, give it some.
1588640	1590600	Come on, it ticked!
1590640	1593600	I might be quite pushy with it, so we really get stuck into it.
1593640	1595600	Scamp on it, fella.
1595640	1597600	All 11 stone here.
1597640	1599600	Bingo!
1599640	1602600	Whoo! That's what a bit of graft does for you, boys!
1602640	1603600	Whoo!
1603640	1606600	Right, my furor, what do you think?
1606640	1607600	Perfect.
1612640	1614520	With all available hands,
1614520	1617480	with hands on beds and nobody hunting or fishing,
1617520	1620480	cameraman Sam Brown has once again spent the morning
1620520	1623480	trying to conjure up something for lunch.
1623520	1626480	I feel a little bit like this child catcher this morning.
1626520	1630480	We're going to boil them all to death and then eat them with soup.
1630520	1634480	Shush, my pretties, it's nearly over.
1634520	1638480	I think the only job I haven't done so far on this tour
1638520	1641480	is the difficult task of cooking.
1641520	1643480	Mmm, cooking.
1643480	1646440	Right, Sam, there's guys up there busting their knackers.
1646480	1648440	I don't know how many blisters.
1648480	1650440	I'm going to help the lads with wood, that's all.
1650480	1652440	I've just been up to help the lads with wood
1652480	1654440	and there's no more for me to carry down.
1654480	1656440	Let's chop some down, then.
1658480	1662440	If he keeps going like that, you know, I'll react.
1662480	1664440	You know, I know I will.
1664480	1666440	It's good for us to vent. Fucking hell.
1666480	1668440	Shit!
1668480	1671440	It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.
1671440	1675400	You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!
1675440	1678400	Makes us all feel much better.
1678440	1680400	They're chopping wood, they're not busting your guts.
1680440	1683400	I can't help them chop more because I don't have a fucking machete.
1683440	1685400	He's only got three and a half.
1685440	1687400	A leaderless group fighting to stay alive
1687440	1689400	is always going to face conflict.
1689440	1692400	And what happens is individuals tend to push their own agendas
1692440	1696400	and that, in turn, takes away valuable time and valuable energy
1696440	1698400	for the things that really matter.
1701440	1703400	How's the soup looking, Sam?
1703440	1706400	Really good, mate. Really, really good.
1706440	1710400	Your three-and-a-half-hour making soup could be done in 25 minutes.
1710440	1712400	You want to...? Really?
1712440	1714400	How difficult can stirring soup be?
1714440	1717400	To some, it would look like you didn't want to go do the harder job.
1717440	1718400	Excuse me?
1718440	1720400	Some would say it's because you didn't want to go bust a gut.
1720440	1722400	I would say, fuck you to that person. That's what I'd say.
1722440	1724400	Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
1724440	1726400	Shall we just calm it down a bit?
1726440	1728400	We're here for another, what, three or four weeks?
1728440	1730400	Just let's fucking calm down, eh?
1730400	1732360	There's no need to be like this.
1733400	1736360	So you're saying I'm avoiding graft, Vic? Is that what you're saying?
1736400	1737360	Are you?
1737400	1740360	That sounded very much like you were just a second ago.
1740400	1742360	You're answering the question with the question, are you?
1742400	1743360	What? Are you?
1743400	1745360	What? Am I avoiding graft? Yeah.
1745400	1747360	I fucking don't think so, man.
1747400	1749360	Then why are you biting, then? What?
1749400	1752360	Cos you've been niggling for weeks.
1752400	1753360	Have I?
1753400	1755360	This is what it boils down to for me, Vic.
1755400	1758360	You act like certain jobs are like macho jobs,
1758400	1760360	fishing, chopping wood, everything else,
1760360	1761320	women's work.
1761360	1763320	That's the feeling I get, right?
1763360	1765320	And if that's cooking, that's fucking carrying water,
1765360	1767320	whatever it is, in your head, it's like,
1767360	1770320	this is graft, this is good, everything else, not difficult.
1770360	1774320	I think feeding everybody is one of the most important jobs on this island.
1774360	1775320	So do I.
1775360	1777320	Every job is a manual job.
1777360	1780320	Some jobs, boom, they're done. 25 minutes, they're done.
1780360	1782320	And every three quarts of an hour, you steer it.
1782360	1783320	Is that right?
1783360	1787320	What I'm trying to do, Vic, is get as many good meals out of this as I can, right?
1787360	1789320	Rather than just use it once and throw it away.
1789320	1790280	You don't need it.
1790320	1791280	Yeah.
1795320	1798280	So maybe just keep your comments to yourself if you don't know about it, huh?
1798320	1800280	I thought we were allowed to hear his comments.
1800320	1802280	Yeah, well, it's great, but if you want to fucking, like,
1802320	1805280	if you want to piss me off, you're going about it the right way.
1809320	1812280	Some jobs are physically easy, some jobs aren't.
1812320	1814280	Is that a better way to put it?
1814320	1817280	You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people is physically easy
1817320	1819280	and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.
1820320	1822320	We have a warning for you, mate.
1822360	1823320	Oh, baby!
1836320	1838280	We look absolutely furious.
1838320	1842280	If a mate said that to me, I'd fucking hit them, you know?
1842320	1846280	If someone at work said that, we'd have trouble, you know?
1846320	1849280	Fucking butt. I'd just... I'd take...
1849280	1851560	There's no good way to take that, right?
1851600	1855920	I take that as, like, a stab at my integrity.
1855960	1857360	Fuck it, man.
1860720	1863880	I look forward to sitting down in some 25-minute soup at some stage.
1874480	1876840	We have built the honeymoon suite.
1876840	1880520	It is strong enough for the rampy-pampy, you'll see, yeah.
1881680	1882960	4pm.
1883000	1886040	After a day of hard graft, the beds are finished.
1887280	1890320	Welcome to the chateau.
1890360	1891760	Let's open the curtain.
1894000	1898320	And that there is the most uncomfortable beds
1898360	1900000	anyone will ever sleep on.
1903680	1905320	Oh!
1905360	1906800	This is where the magic happens.
1906880	1908880	It's not too bad, actually.
1908920	1910920	I will say one thing. What?
1910960	1913760	Right above your head, a lot of daylight.
1913800	1916800	That, Piers, is my skylight.
1919560	1923040	The men will now have better protection from the jungle critters.
1923080	1928240	But the day of hard physical labour has left them hungry and shattered.
1928280	1930360	I am running on empty.
1930400	1933760	I feel like I'm lugging my body about.
1933800	1935640	I can't even stand up straight.
1935680	1936560	I'm starting to sweat.
1936560	1939320	I'm starting to sway, so I can just slurp my words a bit.
1943280	1945600	Since Vic went on fishing strike,
1945640	1950040	the men have survived on Sam's leftover soup and slithers of coconut.
1952440	1954440	And Vic isn't impressed.
1956480	1958560	If I eat any more of this shit, I'm going to puke.
1958600	1959600	It's horrible.
1961560	1962480	Coconut.
1962520	1964200	Yay!
1964240	1966400	That's your shit sort of iron needle.
1966560	1969320	Mother Nature, you can be a cruel, cruel mistress.
1969360	1970480	Do you know that?
1973400	1974600	She's not going to beat me.
1976320	1977720	There's nothing going to beat me.
1985360	1987200	Fucking hellfire.
1987240	1988400	Disgusting.
1991800	1993960	Ah, screw it. That's it. I've had enough.
1996560	1998800	Come on, Victor, let's have some fish.
2000280	2004840	Despite Vic's strike, he's determined to catch a decent fish supper
2004880	2007520	and persuades Kyle to join him on the raft.
2009880	2014080	Instead of catching little fish, I want to be catching some that are bigger.
2014120	2015400	What's getting out of you?
2016560	2022400	With my health and safety hat on, I'd be more worried that we've got a homemade raft
2022440	2026400	in some very strong currents in a very deep piece of water.
2026560	2029560	Vic and Kyle are already 200 yards from shore.
2029600	2032880	Should something happen, they're dangerously out of their depth.
2034080	2035960	Oh, this is something, Vic.
2036000	2037080	Ooh.
2039080	2040560	Has Daddy got a tug?
2041800	2042800	Oh!
2042840	2043840	Do you have a tug?
2043880	2044840	Oh!
2044880	2047160	I think Daddy might have a tug, pal.
2047200	2049120	Get on the end of that, kid.
2049160	2050640	Feel the end of that.
2050680	2052400	I'm not sure what it is.
2052440	2054240	What the fuck is that?
2054280	2055280	I don't know.
2055320	2056240	I don't know.
2056240	2057240	What's that?
2057280	2060320	What the effing hell is that?
2060360	2063080	We've got ourselves a fucking eel, kid!
2063120	2065120	You, sir, are going fucking nowhere.
2065160	2066160	Can you hold that for me?
2066200	2067200	Yeah, of course.
2067240	2068240	Thank you.
2069840	2071200	Right, now I've pinned him.
2071240	2072680	Pinned him down to the side.
2073640	2074640	Good man.
2075880	2079280	I now need to club him with something, and I think that might be this.
2079320	2080760	Have I got plenty of space?
2082880	2084280	Oh, yes.
2084320	2085760	Yeah, I do believe that's him.
2086240	2087840	As we speak now.
2087880	2090440	Right, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
2090480	2092440	Oh, you fucker, yeah.
2092480	2096240	I don't like this fucking fighting bat bollocks at all.
2096280	2098280	I really don't.
2104680	2108080	They're 200, 300, 400 yards out now.
2108120	2109200	And still going.
2110840	2114280	One of the most precious resources that the men actually have
2114320	2115240	is their own energy.
2115280	2116200	Yeah.
2116240	2119920	They're living hand-to-mouth, struggling for every mouthful of food.
2119960	2122920	The temptation is to go to greater and greater lengths
2122960	2125360	to get that precious energy.
2125400	2126400	Right, that's it.
2126440	2128000	I can now tie you up.
2128040	2129440	Safely.
2129480	2130680	But here's the danger.
2130720	2132720	The more malnourished the men get,
2132760	2135440	the more their judgement gets impaired.
2135480	2138960	That's when the small mistakes become full-blown emergencies,
2139000	2140920	and that can happen in the blink of an eye.
2142240	2143920	Two of those, pretty nice bat.
2143960	2145000	Come on.
2145000	2146800	That's one hell of a tide, isn't it?
2146840	2148200	They're getting carried.
2149800	2151720	We are going backwards.
2151760	2154520	Right, go on, paddle, paddle, paddle. Don't stop.
2154560	2158280	Vic and Kyle are attempting to paddle back to the beach.
2158320	2159640	I don't like this, mate.
2159680	2160800	No, neither do I.
2160840	2162480	Start paddling now!
2164640	2167800	But they've been caught by a powerful undercurrent.
2167840	2169360	Paddle.
2169400	2170840	Paddle, guys!
2171760	2173800	Come on!
2173840	2174920	You all right?
2175000	2176600	I think the current's got them.
2176640	2178200	Come on!
2178240	2179400	Come on, let's go.
2179440	2180560	Fucking hell.
2186760	2188600	Come on!
2188640	2191120	Come on, boy!
2191160	2193160	Yeah!
2193200	2194480	We're going to crash, though!
2194520	2195400	Come on!
2195440	2196640	At the mercy of the current,
2196680	2201240	the raft is on a collision course with the island's treacherous rocky coastline,
2201280	2203320	which could tear the men to shreds.
2203360	2204680	Come on, Kyle, dig the fucker in.
2204680	2206680	Paddle, paddle!
2206720	2208080	And turn again, you know.
2208120	2209600	Oh, baby.
2209640	2211840	It'll... Right, paddle, paddle!
2211880	2212880	Paddle!
2212920	2214320	Don't stop, don't stop.
2214360	2215920	No!
2217920	2221000	Everybody safe? Everybody OK? No injuries?
2221040	2223320	Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord for that.
2224840	2227320	After surviving a near-death experience,
2227360	2230320	the men are shaken, but physically unscathed.
2231920	2234400	It all got mangled up and chaffed up.
2234400	2236840	Their raft, though, is destroyed.
2239240	2241240	That must have been fucking scary, man.
2241280	2243240	Yeah, it was.
2243280	2245280	We were getting smashed on the rocks and everything,
2245320	2247440	so I do appreciate that.
2248720	2253880	Sam and Dan's swift actions saved Vic and Kyle from annihilation on the rocks.
2253920	2255960	It was fucking hairy, mate.
2256000	2260840	Like, that was... I think that was the closest I've been to coughing on this trip.
2260880	2262480	Thanks for coming and helping us, guys.
2262520	2264200	Let's get back to camp before dark.
2264200	2265200	Yeah, yeah.
2265240	2268640	First light tomorrow, we'll try and salvage as much of this as we can.
2272240	2276320	With their raft in tatters and Vic's eel lost to the ocean,
2276360	2279240	the men now face a second night with empty stomachs.
2288080	2290920	Where the hell's the rest of the raft?
2290960	2293000	Oh, shit, is that the raft?
2293000	2294560	The tripster is no longer, boys.
2294600	2295600	Yes.
2296960	2298600	Vic's got a brave face, hasn't he?
2298640	2300120	But he's really shook up.
2300160	2302040	He could have just been knocked unconscious,
2302080	2304120	brain splattered out in a rock.
2304160	2305680	He could have died.
2305720	2307200	Like, actually, he could have died.
2308360	2311960	Vic's near-death experience isn't the only thing on his mind.
2313720	2317320	It's been a little bit quite difficult today, truth's known, for me.
2318640	2322000	It's come up to fifth, which is the date of my first date with my missus.
2322000	2324000	And I'm missing her immensely.
2324040	2326840	So, tomorrow, I may spend lots and lots of time
2326880	2330400	contemplating my missus and all that sort of thing.
2344040	2345040	Morning.
2345080	2347240	Oh, that was a good sleep.
2347280	2348680	Oh, morning.
2348720	2350000	I'm so happy.
2350040	2351000	I'm so happy.
2351000	2352120	Good morning.
2353040	2356200	After a savage sandfly attack 24 hours ago,
2356240	2358080	the men have spent their first night
2358120	2361120	raised off the ground in their own beds.
2361160	2362240	Good morning.
2363320	2365960	Oh, last night was wonderful.
2366000	2370040	Last night was the best unbroken sleep I've had by a mile.
2372440	2376240	This time, it's Vic who hasn't slept a wink.
2376280	2379400	Vic looks like he spent the entire night sitting on a fence post.
2379440	2380840	The poor bugger looks absolutely drained.
2380840	2381960	He's got a lot of strain today.
2382000	2382800	He's got a lot of strain today.
2382840	2383840	He's got a lot of strain today.
2383880	2387440	Victor looks a little bit edgy today.
2387480	2391680	I can see him cracking a little bit.
2391720	2394000	Hopefully, he's all right.
2394040	2397560	You know, he's not the kind of guy who would show his emotions.
2397600	2401920	He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.
2401960	2403720	He's definitely that kind of old-school British, macho male.
2403760	2407800	Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.
2407840	2408920	Today is the 20th anniversary of Vic's first date with his wife.
2408960	2409920	Never again.
2409960	2410640	Never again.
2410640	2411840	Never again.
2411880	2413240	Never in this long.
2415360	2417160	The greatest thing that ever happened to me,
2417200	2419560	other than being born, was my wife.
2419600	2421520	I can't wait to get back to Cheryl.
2421560	2423320	Smell her, taste her, touch her, feel her.
2423360	2425520	All them things.
2425560	2426840	I love that woman so much.
2426880	2428200	It's immense.
2428240	2430880	Truly immense.
2430920	2433400	As human beings, when we're stripped of everything,
2433440	2436360	the real essence of who we are is laid bare.
2438520	2439740	Every single one of them
2439740	2441740	It is just a nature of survival.
2441740	2443740	It's a nature of enduring hardship.
2443740	2446740	If you can take a long, hard look at yourself
2446740	2448740	when you're at your lowest ebb,
2448740	2451740	and in that moment you can accept what you see,
2451740	2454740	in my eye, that's what makes you a true survivor.
2457740	2460740	Devastated. Absolutely devastated.
2460740	2463740	This is literally what we were getting smashed against yesterday.
2463740	2465740	It's so dangerous.
2465740	2466740	Yeah.
2466740	2471740	Oh, I feel so dreadful at the moment. It's unbelievable.
2471740	2474740	This beautiful, dangerous paradise can be a killer.
2474740	2478740	You take your eye off the ball and she's going to bite you in the arse.
2478740	2483740	The raft crash will stay with me till the day I die.
2483740	2485740	These guys saved my life.
2489740	2493740	In camp, Vic calls the men together for a chat.
2496740	2499740	I'd just like to say if I ever offended anybody, upset them,
2499740	2502740	unduly, and it weren't deserved, then I apologise.
2502740	2504740	It won't happen again.
2504740	2508740	I worry immensely about providing for me and mine,
2508740	2511740	so perhaps that's why I compensate for working so physically hard,
2511740	2513740	like a fool, like a donkey.
2513740	2515740	I've got a fantastic wife and kids,
2515740	2519740	but I have this overwhelming urge to provide.
2519740	2521740	It drives me more than anything else,
2521740	2524740	and the fear of not being able to do that is terrifying.
2524740	2525740	Terrifying.
2525740	2530740	Vic, the man that said a few weeks ago,
2530740	2535740	erm, he does not see the point in crying...
2537740	2539740	..cried.
2539740	2543740	The way that you describe your wife and your family
2543740	2545740	I find inspirational.
2546740	2551740	I've never known a man to come away with a group of guys
2551740	2554740	and to say, I love my wife to bits.
2554740	2557740	She's the best thing I've ever experienced in my life.
2557740	2559740	I never hear that.
2559740	2561740	And that's one thing I'm going to take away from you.
2561740	2563740	I'm going to take that.
2563740	2566740	Every time you talk about Cheryl, like, I feel like she's in the room.
2566740	2568740	Don't get me wrong, Vic, you've pissed me off
2568740	2570740	more than just about anyone here.
2570740	2573740	But overall, mate, you're worth every ounce of you.
2573740	2576740	You've lifted us up more times than I can say.
2576740	2579740	We'd be seriously worse off if you weren't here.
2582740	2584740	I weren't expecting this. I won't be honest.
2584740	2586740	Not at all.
2586740	2589740	I expected difficulties and hungers and confrontation and conflict,
2589740	2591740	but not to find something out about me.
2591740	2593740	That was the last thing I expected.
2597740	2600740	What a great bunch of blokes these really are.
2600740	2602740	What a great bunch of blokes.
2602740	2605740	I ain't never going to see eye to eye with them all,
2605740	2607740	but on this island, it's a family.
2607740	2609740	It's the island family.
2614740	2616740	It's the island family.
2619740	2622740	Vic calls an end to his fishing strike
2622740	2626740	and heads out on his own to catch dinner for the group.
2626740	2629740	Nice and steady. Nice and fucking steady.
2629740	2631740	Hold your ground.
2631740	2633740	We're good. We're good. We're good.
2636740	2640740	It's been three days since the men had anything substantial to eat
2640740	2643740	and they are obsessing about food.
2643740	2645740	There was this documentary about some women
2645740	2649740	that were still breastfeeding kids at the age of, was it three, four?
2649740	2653740	I always think that the longer you're on the breast, the better.
2653740	2655740	What, eight, nine? Yeah.
2655740	2658740	I think if you're taken off the breast too early...
2658740	2660740	You become short. ..it stunts your growth.
2665740	2667740	Well, hello!
2667740	2669740	Gentlemen. Yes, Vic.
2669740	2672740	How are we all? What did you get, Vic?
2672740	2676740	I wish I had a fish for each of us, but alas, I don't.
2676740	2677740	Oh.
2677740	2679740	What I can say, though, is this.
2679740	2681740	Of the five fish I've caught...
2681740	2683740	Hello! Hello!
2683740	2686740	..two are the biggest I have ever caught in all my life.
2686740	2689740	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2691740	2694740	And one of them is the size of a small dog.
2694740	2696740	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2696740	2698740	Yeah, boy!
2698740	2700740	Daddy brought home the bacon.
2700740	2702740	Yeah! Yeah!
2702740	2704740	They are massive, Vickers!
2704740	2707740	For he's a jolly good fellow!
2707740	2709740	For he's a jolly good fellow!
2709740	2711740	For he's a jolly good fellow!
2711740	2713740	And so say all of us!
2713740	2715740	He's back to normal Vic fellows.
2715740	2716740	Woo!
2716740	2718740	Shouting and whooping and getting fish and stuff like that,
2718740	2719740	everything that he loves.
2719740	2721740	Look at the size of that, bitch.
2721740	2722740	Oh!
2727740	2729740	Fripster will sail again.
2729740	2731740	Fripster 2 will sail again.
2732740	2734740	I can't get the Titanic theme tune in my head.
2734740	2736740	That was like Titanic.
2736740	2738740	See, if I was Kate Winslet, who was Leonardo?
2738740	2740740	LAUGHTER
2740740	2742740	Oh, it's small.
2746740	2749740	Sometimes I like to smash him repeatedly in the face,
2749740	2752740	but I think me and Vic were in danger of becoming quite good friends.
2752740	2754740	Huge respect for the guy.
2754740	2757740	Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick! Vick!
2757740	2759740	Woo!
2759740	2761740	When in doubt, send Vic out!
2761740	2763740	Yeah!
2765740	2767740	Next time on The Women's Island...
2767740	2769740	You are not leaving this island.
2769740	2772740	I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back.
2772740	2775740	The one thing we need for George is food.
2775740	2777740	Get the knife! Get the knife!
2777740	2779740	Come here, come here, come here!
2779740	2782740	I think it's about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal.
2782740	2784740	There, there, there, there, there.
2784740	2785740	Go.
2785740	2786740	HE GRUNTS
