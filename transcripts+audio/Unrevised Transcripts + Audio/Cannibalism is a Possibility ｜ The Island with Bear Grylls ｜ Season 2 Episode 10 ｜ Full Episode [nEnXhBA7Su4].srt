1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,980
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,560
will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,800
and fishing equipment how many fishing lines have you hooked up before film filming everything

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,980
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,200
strength the winds a day who will have what it takes

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,960
to

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,980
to stay alive tonight we follow the men's Island

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,900
every single time it's little old me I don't trust you survival will be harder than ever

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,300
they'll have to endure the height of the harsh tropical storm season

11
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,720
they'll have to find their own water and hunt for their own food you took the hook of the lot

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
and these Monday men oh got what it takes to survive

13
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,680
foreign

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,700
four weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island hello

15
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,360
you can see Pierce's heart beating through his rib despite their best efforts

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,740
so

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
been able to find a sustainable source of food.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
We need some decent food, we need it quick.

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,120
And the men are getting weaker by the day.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Exhausted.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,980
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

22
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,580
The group's become increasingly fractured.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,980
You tell any chef that cooking for 11 people

24
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,340
is physically easy and he'll stab you in the fucking eye.

25
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,900
So far, it's 47-year-old Vic,

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,920
the island's top hunter, who's managed to save the group

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
from starvation.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,260
When in doubt, send Vic out!

29
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,880
If I laid back, a little bit further into the sun,

30
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,940
it would feel like I was on holiday.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,420
Apart from the fact that later on,

32
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,580
I'm gonna have to walk half a mile

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,740
for one night.

34
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,880
Water, fish until we can eat,

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
and chop a load of firewood.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Potentially the shittest holiday anyone will ever go on.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,180
The men have now been living on the island for a month.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Unable to find a reliable source of food,

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,140
they've had to survive on a meagre low-calorie diet

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,540
of limpets, coconut, and the occasional fish.

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,740
We are starting to starve.

42
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,680
We're not eating enough.

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,540
I mean, look, I've never seen my ribcage like that

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,780
since I was bloody 12 or 13.

45
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
I've got a bloody lollipop head.

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,860
It looks wrong size to my body.

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,580
It looks completely out of place.

48
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,680
There's nothing to me.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,700
After four weeks on such an extreme, low-calorie diet,

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
the men are actually in danger of entering what's called,

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,060
autophagy.

52
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,460
And this literally means to self-eat.

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,940
Their bodies start to cannibalize themselves,

54
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,200
and if they don't find a sustainable food source

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
for the long-term, their physical condition

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,460
won't just be in decline, it'll be in free fall.

57
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,500
We'll start with Charlie, what are you doing?

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm building. Phil?

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
I'm doing water and wood,

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
and then chipping in for whatever needs doing.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,240
You're man.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,080
For the exhausted men,

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,460
the morning meeting has become a vital way

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,440
of sharing out their daily chores.

65
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,900
Trapping assistant.

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,740
Good man.

67
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,980
Vic's gonna do water, wood,

68
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,820
and help anybody else doing whatever they need doing.

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,840
Sam?

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
The hunting is the thing

71
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,200
that I'm probably the most excited by.

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
For a personal level,

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,640
I don't think I've quite achieved my personal ambition yet.

74
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,380
My personal ambition would be to catch a vulture

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,220
or something like that.

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,600
It's a lot of effort to do, isn't it?

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Will you be doing wood, then?

78
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,960
Well, when I get back, I can do wood, but...

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,280
You've got a master skill at avoiding that wood job,

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,680
haven't you?

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
If you don't bust a gut getting wood,

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
we're gonna run out, and everybody's gonna know

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,020
you were on wood, you were a lazy bastard.

84
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,920
The group has given Sam his orders for the day,

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,340
but he's not convinced.

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,180
Collecting firewood's important,

87
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,920
and I'll do my bit, definitely,

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
but I'd love to do a bit more hunting.

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,320
And, you know, it's that man against beast thing

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
that I really enjoy.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Yeah, this is not dangerous.

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,360
With around 30 liters of water

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,380
and up to 50 kilos of firewood to collect,

94
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,660
the men have a grueling morning ahead of them.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,260
This wood is ridiculous.

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,100
Go on, man.

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,940
Look at this.

98
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,760
Go on, man.

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
Go on.

100
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,580
Let's roll.

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,420
Yay!

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080
Yeah!

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,900
Yeah!

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,700
Against the express wishes of the group,

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,960
Sam has decided to spend the morning bird trapping

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,280
instead of chopping wood.

107
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,120
It's quite exciting.

108
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,920
So I'm under a little hide.

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Not the best hide in the world, but a hide.

110
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,460
And I've got this little cord here.

111
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,460
And hopefully, the vulture's going to come down,

112
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,420
grab the meat, and I'll pull this rope,

113
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,420
and we'll be in business.

114
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
Let's just wait and see.

115
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,420
I work on foreign news stories.

116
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,420
The problem with news is you always go to

117
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
some of the nastiest places in the world.

118
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,420
I have been shot at.

119
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
I've had a near kidnapping.

120
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,620
But I try to avoid those sort of things as best I can.

121
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,580
I'm aware that I'm incredibly privileged.

122
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,580
You know, I haven't met the queen,

123
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
but I have had an amazing opportunity

124
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
to meet people from every different sphere of life.

125
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,580
I would hope that I'm not prejudiced.

126
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,580
I do have opinions, but I've got a bit of grace to me.

127
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,540
Dad, I'm hiding for a vulture.

128
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,980
And you're slightly spoiling it.

129
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
Where are you?

130
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
I'm hiding here.

131
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
Ready for a vulture.

132
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,700
Oh, for fuck's sake.

133
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,820
The whole point of the morning meeting

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,460
is to get distinct tasks.

135
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,880
If he's got a task,

136
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,860
he needs to complete the task before any passing.

137
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,080
Phe皇 night.

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,580
Now...

139
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,340
or it moves on to something else.

140
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,980
Softly, softly is not working anymore,

141
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,780
so we just need to be a bit more firm with people, I think.

142
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,260
Sam, we need you to stick to our tasks,

143
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,700
otherwise we're not gonna get shit done.

144
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,460
It's like nearly 11 o'clock and you haven't done any.

145
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,300
Good to do.

146
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,140
I'm heading there now,

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,180
and it's raining coconut for the doom trap as well.

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,700
But you're not doing traps, we're doing traps.

149
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,940
You're not doing traps, are you?

150
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,100
You just concentrate on what you're supposed to be doing.

151
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,580
If you've got a task, stick to it, complete it, finish it.

152
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,420
Right.

153
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,260
Good.

154
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,540
I don't know, I don't know.

155
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,060
Bloke Talk's a good, nice, posh game,

156
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,100
but failing to deliver in my book,

157
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,860
and an island where manual graft is king.

158
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,100
We all have to work and sweat.

159
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Oops, now I ain't done jack shit.

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,740
Shall I drop this in then, me old brute?

161
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,340
Sam's reluctance to fall in with the others

162
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,020
is starting to affect his reputation in the group.

163
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,020
Do you know, I've given up trying to second-guess Sam Farmer.

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,340
He's his own man, he sort of exists in another world.

165
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,260
He's an airhead, isn't he, and he's...

166
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,340
Oh, yes, oh, yeah, er...

167
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,180
Vultures.

168
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,780
Exactly, he must get a bird trap.

169
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,140
And I think everyone feels the bird traps are a waste of time.

170
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
There's a bit of selfishness there.

171
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,500
I don't, I think...

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,140
But I don't think it means to be selfish,

173
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,940
I just think that's the way it's been brought on.

174
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,780
For me, and this is my opinion,

175
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,740
if that is something that Sam wants to do,

176
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,500
he'll work fucking hard for it.

177
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
Agreed. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,940
I just think he's had his arse wiped for him for the most of his life.

179
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,300
And as a result, he doesn't realise

180
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,540
when he's possibly not mucking in as much as he could do

181
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,820
with others.

182
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,380
A lot of the guys here are kind of like,

183
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,420
I do hard graft, I come from this place, I don't come from that...

184
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,460
And they're a posh voice,

185
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,740
and the fact that they went to Eton,

186
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,580
I think some guys here...

187
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,300
just don't relate to him very well as the men continue to physically decline

188
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,740
the group is becoming fractured and it's as if they're judging each other not

189
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,940
only on their ability to contribute and find food but also in class prejudices

190
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:52,420
and that's coming to the fore an hour before nightfall a tropical storm hits

191
00:09:52,420 --> 00:10:00,220
the island it's gonna rain it's coming in guys it's gonna rain when it rains it

192
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:09,280
rains faster it's hard the men have just minutes to secure the camp before it's

193
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,780
washed away

194
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,540
how's the fire Sam need some dry kindling

195
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,740
desperately need to protect the firewood

196
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:40,920
it's amazing because it's pouring of rain and under those trees it sort of

197
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,780
feels quite dark inside kind of panic don't stop don't stop and you come out

198
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,300
here onto the beach there's an incredible sunset over there and it's

199
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
just glistening on the water

200
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,920
the sun's just glistening on the water and it just feels really quite peaceful

201
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,060
actually really quite peaceful moment split some bamboo and we can make a

202
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,060
drain pipe to carry it down to the beach heavens absolutely opened enough to

203
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:14,800
wash out the entire camp all hands to the deck there are certain times when

204
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,420
some people need to pull their finger out and start working

205
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Oh

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I have had some monster fucking bogeys off this island bogeys monsters yeah that

207
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,380
must be one of the biggest bogeys I've ever had in my life eat it no calories

208
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,300
you dirty bastard I mean you're quite welcome to it fella if you want it I'm

209
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,180
absolutely fine thanks Vic I'm not that hungry yet mate very tasty after last night's

210
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,420
vicious storm the men's shelter is in urgent need of repair

211
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I feel like a shire horse

212
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
I feel like a shire horse

213
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,800
I see that might work yeah that one never changes peers Dan and Sam Farmer

214
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,860
have been assigned the job of weaving new palms for the roof that's looks

215
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,100
pretty good that's not right it's not you're bending in the wrong way to start

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,260
with but Sam's struggling

217
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm working now yes sir I don't know abandon my duty but I'm I'm actually

218
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,420
really crap at this weaving I don't want to abandon my duty but I'm actually really crap at this weaving

219
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,680
no one's good at it everyone shitters each other I can't actually get to work

220
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,560
though I spent 45 minutes pat it and I'm obviously doing something wrong you need

221
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,760
a lot more determination Sam just crack on with it just stay with it I've got to

222
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,660
pay to my strengths and one of my strengths isn't plastic

223
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,200
better fucking stick with it

224
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,420
we need to sort it out demand the fuck up anyone fishing now it's too rough

225
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Sam Farmer is...

226
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Sam Farmer is...

227
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,320
shirking some of the harder tasks and it's been noticed by a lot of members of

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
the group

229
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,500
I think some people in this group were working harder than others I don't want

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,620
to point any fingers but Sam I do have a bit of an issue with Sam Farmer at the

231
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,340
minute yeah he's getting under my skin just seems to potter about the place as

232
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,280
if he's looking for his butler sensing the group is starting to turn

233
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,560
against him Sam decides to approach one of his critics I hate tension and when

234
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,820
you can feel that someone's not quite at ease with you I think it's worth

235
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,420
nipping things in the bud early

236
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Sam can I have a quick word?

237
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,420
I feel that you're a bit frustrated with me and I don't want to make a big deal out of it

238
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
a little bit man I am

239
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
can we talk about it later? I'm busy

240
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
actually...

241
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,300
Sam let's talk about it later okay? I'm working well there'll be plenty of time okay?

242
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I'd rather talk it out now because it's in the air

243
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
and quite a few people mention it to me

244
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
Sam not now okay?

245
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,420
not now please let me finish this later on when we're having some food

246
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
five minutes?

247
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,420
no let me get this tree down and maybe okay?

248
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
not highly successful

249
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
never mind he's not happy

250
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,420
people are having a bit of a go at Sam Farmer and I'm finding it a bit mean really

251
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Sam works really really hard but he works really hard on his own

252
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,420
and a lot of the things he wants to do he's getting a bit sidetracked in that regard

253
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,420
determined to stop the rift between Sam and the group getting any worse

254
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,420
Will takes him aside for a chat

255
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,420
I definitely think I'm putting my weight

256
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,420
but I think it could be perceived that you're doing the things that you want to do

257
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I honestly don't mind what I do

258
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
and I know that I can see that

259
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,420
but if you're doing it on your own and no one's noticing

260
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,420
it doesn't get any kudos at all

261
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
how bad is the gossip you think?

262
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
quite bad

263
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
if I'm honest everyone's

264
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,420
it's yeah I mean that's why we're having this conversation

265
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
thanks Will thanks very much

266
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
the last few days have been quite frustrating

267
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
quite a bit of gunning down

268
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,420
I gossip you know what's Sam up to or what's he doing

269
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,420
and it's really hard it's really frustrating

270
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,420
because I really believe I genuinely believe that I'm working as hard as anyone else

271
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,420
and I'm giving my all and I'm putting my back into this

272
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,420
wanting to explain himself to the group Sam calls a meeting

273
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
I've actually found the last three weeks quite hard

274
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,420
I found the physical exhaustion that comes with a lack of food

275
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,420
really hard really really really hard

276
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,420
and I wanted to say thank you really first of all

277
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,420
to all you guys for being so amazing

278
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,420
and also for bearing with me

279
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I haven't sort of almost been myself actually as much as I wanted to be myself

280
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,420
back in the big smoke I dare say that bloke's king of the hill

281
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,420
no two ways about it how he talks walks and conducts himself

282
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
a great mind's fantastic but we don't need great minds here

283
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,420
we're cavemen we need to sweat blood and guts

284
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,420
and if you're not then it stands out like a blind cobbler's thumb don't it

285
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
determined to prove his worth to the others

286
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Sam has decided to resurrect the group's old fishing nets

287
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
we have not put one fish in the net yet

288
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,420
if we can get these nets out I feel that the sea is our larder

289
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,420
but having failed with a net several times already

290
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,420
the others aren't convinced by Sam's latest idea

291
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,420
these fucking nets waste more energy than anything else

292
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,420
the amount of calories and energy people have expended with no return

293
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
is unbelievable

294
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I mean it's just nuts

295
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
with heavy weights and floats to get into position

296
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Sam's enlisted the help of Barney to set the nets

297
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Barney I'm smacked here

298
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
fuck

299
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
because there are a lot of rocks around here

300
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,420
dragging heavy fishing nets out to sea fighting the currents

301
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,420
is going to burn through hundreds and hundreds of calories

302
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
with so little energy in their body

303
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,420
for them it's going to probably feel like swimming through treacle

304
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
ok ready

305
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
one two three

306
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,260
go

307
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
gosh that was exhausting

308
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
exhausting

309
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
after treading water for over an hour

310
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Sam and Barney can finally head back to dry land

311
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
how you going lads

312
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
where you got chaps

313
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
absolutely knackered

314
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
it was absolutely just shattering

315
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
we really really need to have

316
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
five minutes or ten minutes of rest

317
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:26,520
lie down do I've got some fish for you there he is the islands top fisherman

318
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,240
Vic is returning to camp after another successful outing with his line and pole

319
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:41,200
oh god damn boys about three in a puffer I have oh my god you hear it born and

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,840
bread kid man's a hero back right here champ is that okay with you sir yeah

321
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,160
lovely it's leaving there cuz the kaboom that's what we're having yeah can I take

322
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,740
these horrible fish off my exceptionally good fishing pole yes to come on that

323
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,980
thank you oh dear me nice feeling I have to know you're gonna actually feel some

324
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,540
food in your belly I was the old Nescau tiger

325
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:19,240
there's not a great deal to go round of the four fish Vic caught one is a

326
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,960
poisonous puffer fish leaving only three to share for lunch between eleven

327
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:37,580
ravenous men it's not gonna feed the 5,000 Sam is convinced his nets are the

328
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,240
group's best chance of breaking the famine

329
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,140
but it's not the end of the world

330
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,180
but it's not the end of the world

331
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,500
he can't man them alone I actually came out here to grab Barney for the net

332
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,740
there's wood to be got and it's not fair to leave two or three lads doing it

333
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,580
but I thought it was a 20-minute job what made you think that have you done a

334
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,960
full day on wood yet no that's why you think it's 20 minute job I know I think

335
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,340
you've done I think you have rolled them nets up out there and just go for a swim

336
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,160
every day listen this is what happened right when we get back we forgot about all these fish

337
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,760
surfs and we forgot about all these fish

338
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,240
institutional charges all this talk about thethey hate us and all this shit

339
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,340
people say to me what do you do and I'll say every day I sweat it as hard as I

340
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,640
could and I was just helpful as I could and they'll say Sam what are you doing

341
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,160
said it was a nightmare I had to swim every day for some fish

342
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,080
that were never thereمن't not clean never there my heart bleeds for you sound

343
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,280

344
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,020
passion the other fur flies Moira ederim Turkey ship South Divide done it goes to estud mosque from I'll inhale air and sold undergraduate beat and you brains down years old!

345
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,060
Down south will work every inch of blood out of us.

346
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,620
I thought you were joking. And you'll smile when you do it.

347
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,260
There you go. Yeah, go for it, Sam.

348
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,100
Finish that baby off. I'll film you, you do it.

349
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
Yeah, I'd love to.

350
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,940
Man's not got a day's graft in him.

351
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,660
Not a fricking day's graft in him.

352
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,820
I shouldn't be hard on the bloke, because if you've never done it,

353
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,620
if you've had your ass wiped all your life, then so be it, you have.

354
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,980
Yeah.

355
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,060
I think Vic has made a judgement about me that, you know,

356
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,540
life's been incredibly easy.

357
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,900
And life has been easy in one sense.

358
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,380
I've had, you know, an incredible upbringing.

359
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,460
I've no embarrassment about the background I've come from

360
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,420
or the family I have or the school I went to

361
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,700
or the places I've been.

362
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,340
They are a huge blessing.

363
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,580
Oh, yeah. That's disgusting.

364
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,980
After just a few mouthfuls of fish for lunch,

365
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,100
tonight's dinner is looking even more bleak.

366
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,820
Limpets.

367
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,140
There is probably 15 each, you'll be pleased to know.

368
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,340
You can all fucking eat your 15 as well.

369
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,380
That's fucking horrible.

370
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,740
We're eating barely enough to survive.

371
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,820
We really need a haul of something,

372
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,580
a big catch to come in or an animal to catch.

373
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
It's so sapping here.

374
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,540
And I'm not quite sure how long we can struggle on for

375
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,860
without a decent feed.

376
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,540
Not too much pressure, but if you don't get any food,

377
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,660
we're fucked, yeah, boys? So, yeah, thanks.

378
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,340
Now released from wood duty, Sam sets off to check his nets.

379
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,180
I'm feeling positive.

380
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,820
Despite the group's hostility, Sam's convinced his nets will work.

381
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,380
I refuse pessimism to seep in.

382
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,460
Absolute refusal.

383
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,380
Optimism it is, then. Optimism it is.

384
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:47,900
Sam knows that a big fish haul can mean not only salvation for the group,

385
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,380
but would also restore his reputation.

386
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,740
It's quite a long way out, isn't it? Yeah, it is.

387
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,620
Argh!

388
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,100
Nothing.

389
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,620
Oh, it's just what I want to hear.

390
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,380
It's just so depressing.

391
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,740
It's done so much work.

392
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,740
Oh...

393
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,100
Very predictable.

394
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,060
It's a waste of energy, time, fuel, everything.

395
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,140
Stop fannying around and start doing something worthwhile.

396
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
Morning!

397
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,660
And what a beautiful marina it is.

398
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,800
After a month on the island, the exhausted men are doing their best to share the most

399
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,700
arduous daily chores between them.

400
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,980
If you keep walking to the kitchen, you're going to find the water, it's almost there.

401
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:03,500
But yesterday, Sam angered the group by prioritising his fishing nets over firewood.

402
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:10,580
Sam checked nets, which brought absolutely diddly squads, I'm afraid to say, a big fat

403
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
nothing.

404
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,860
So there's a bit of tension between the rest of us.

405
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Pretty good.

406
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,260
OK, let's start off the day.

407
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
Who's doing what this war is?

408
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,740
Yeah, I'm doing fishing net.

409
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
I know it's a bit selfish.

410
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,880
No, just get stuck into wood.

411
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Don't make it a token effort.

412
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Get stuck into wood.

413
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,380
We need wood.

414
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Lots of it.

415
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
The nets aren't delivering jack shit.

416
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
We're pissing in the wind with them.

417
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,620
I do feel put upon, actually, a little bit this morning, just by the comments.

418
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,700
It's just maddening.

419
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,180
It's absolutely maddening to be criticised and to be put down.

420
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
It's really, really hard.

421
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
And I had to be biting my tongue.

422
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Let's make a bow, actually.

423
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
Do you want to talk to them?

424
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,880
Yeah, I might have a chat with them.

425
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,880
After days of criticism, Sam is determined to get to the bottom of Vic's hostility.

426
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Vic?

427
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Yeah?

428
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Do you trust me?

429
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
I would never trust a stranger.

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Am I a stranger?

431
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
At first, you were.

432
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
OK.

433
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,880
It's taken me longer to get used to you than it has any of the other guys, because they

434
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
sound a little bit like me.

435
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,880
You're the first person I've ever met that actually speaks like this.

436
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Am I suffering your prejudice because of a bad experience?

437
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
From where I come from?

438
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
From where I come from?

439
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Yeah.

440
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
We vote one, three, four years on a government, yeah?

441
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Yeah.

442
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
And the person we vote for speaks like you.

443
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,880
And we put every last vestige of trust in that person.

444
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,880
And then you dick us every single time.

445
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,880
I have more respect for a man who will break through my front door and steal my telly when

446
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm on holiday than I do that man that tells me on, that does this and don't point because

447
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,880
it's rude and emphasises with his hands, and he's got a great speaking voice and Boris

448
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
and all that sort of shit.

449
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I have no respect whatsoever because they are thieving, lying, clever people with affluence

450
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,880
and money and a good voice and a fantastic education.

451
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Vic, you're basically saying you're all the same.

452
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
That's what you're basically saying.

453
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,880
But yes, which is perhaps lack of education, lack of understanding, lack of experience.

454
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Which is because I'm trapped in a working class life.

455
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
People with power and influence, they just abuse the little man every time.

456
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Do you assume I do have power and influence?

457
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
I mean, it's little old me.

458
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
It's little old me.

459
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,880
But it's difficult to get rid of all them years of listening to people with accent

460
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
and class, tell you one thing and do a totally different thing because then you don't trust

461
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
them at all.

462
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
So unfortunately, I don't trust you.

463
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah.

464
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Interesting.

465
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
It was hard to hear.

466
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I hate conflict.

467
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I have a choice, either just to try and ignore it.

468
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Or I can try and embrace it and show him that actually I'm very different from those

469
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,880
that have put him down in the past.

470
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,880
And my hope is that he will see me by the end of this experiment.

471
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
He will see me as a person who's on his side.

472
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,880
For centuries, you know, the British have been totally class driven, almost class obsessed.

473
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,880
And it's like a pathological disorder where people get fixated on what they're doing.

474
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Where they feel they stand in that pecking order.

475
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Are they lower, middle or upper classes?

476
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
But if the men are going to survive here, they've got to put aside those prejudices

477
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
and work as a team.

478
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Right, people.

479
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
The fishing wheel will go.

480
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm away, boys.

481
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Catch some supper.

482
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Let's have some fish.

483
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
We can all have a decent meal.

484
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
With nothing to eat in camp.

485
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
The starving men have decided to use their last reserves of energy

486
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,880
on one big concerted effort to find food.

487
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Jesus Christ.

488
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Oh, fuck, yes.

489
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Get him.

490
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Get him.

491
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Got him, got him, got him.

492
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Fuck.

493
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
OK.

494
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Oh, his tail snapped off.

495
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Didn't a bloody snake do that?

496
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Despite opposition from the rest of the group,

497
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Sam has decided to persevere with his nets.

498
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
You just have to keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.

499
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Sometimes you fail, and sometimes you're successful.

500
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
We have a first victim down there.

501
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Oh, you say then?

502
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Being the top fish catcher.

503
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Pressure's on.

504
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Yeah, the pressure is on.

505
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,880
But I also think the mark of a man is in rising to pressure.

506
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
We still haven't got anything, anything,

507
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,880
anything, anything.

508
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Desperately, desperately need food.

509
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,880
After five exhausting hours, the men have found nothing for dinner.

510
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Jesus Christ, look at the fucking...

511
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,880
You bastard!

512
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Took the hook and the lot.

513
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
That's bad.

514
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Fuck all.

515
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Even the island's top fisherman, Vic, has had to admit defeat.

516
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Son of a bitch.

517
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'm gutted.

518
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
I really wanted to bring in a nice haul for guys tonight to eat,

519
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
do you know what I mean?

520
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Fuck!

521
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Exhausted, starving hungry and despondent,

522
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
the men gather back in camp.

523
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
So what's the plan, guys?

524
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Try not to slash my wrist.

525
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Without a single scrap of food to show for a day's hunting,

526
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
the group are out of options.

527
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Save one unlikely potential saviour.

528
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
What would you feel about all of us getting the net in today?

529
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Let's say after this meeting, we all troop down there.

530
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I mean, I'm being a bit hopeful.

531
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
How do we empty the nets?

532
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
You've got to bring them in.

533
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Going to have to pull them in.

534
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Ooh, fuck it, I'll fight.

535
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I think it'd be quite good if we could pull together

536
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
and get these things done.

537
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah, fuck it, count me in.

538
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Two crack on?

539
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Fair enough.

540
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Yes, I'll come in the water and pull a net, yeah?

541
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Brilliant. Brilliant.

542
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Sounds good to me.

543
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Yeah. Yeah?

544
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Sounds good.

545
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Ready to go?

546
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Go.

547
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Come on, boys.

548
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Bring home the bacon.

549
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Bring home the fish.

550
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
That's some fishies.

551
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,880
In desperation, the men agree to give Sam's nets a final chance.

552
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
If you don't give up, I'll give him that blessing.

553
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,880
But they are now making a dangerous gamble

554
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
with their last reserves of energy.

555
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Please be fishing this net.

556
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
OK, are you ready?

557
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Ready, ready.

558
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
One, two...

559
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Yes!

560
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Nowhere!

561
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
There's a lot of whooping coming from those nets, people.

562
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Where do you go, lads?

563
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Fuck me.

564
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Hooray!

565
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,680
How many do you think you've got, Sam?

566
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
I don't know.

567
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Jesus Christ.

568
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,680
That's the first one, boys.

569
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh, yeah.

570
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Yeah?

571
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Oh, there's the second one, boys.

572
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,680
And the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.

573
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh, God.

574
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm telling you.

575
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Look at them coming out.

576
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Yeah!

577
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Woo!

578
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Ah!

579
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Look at them!

580
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Come on!

581
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Come on!

582
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Come on!

583
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Woo!

584
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Woo!

585
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Woo!

586
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Yeah!

587
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Yeah!

588
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Come on!

589
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Yeah!

590
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Yeah!

591
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Yeah!

592
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Yeah!

593
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Yeah!

594
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Yeah!

595
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Yeah!

596
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Yeah!

597
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Yeah!

598
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Come on!

599
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Yeah!

600
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Fucking awesome, man.

601
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Well done, man.

602
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Well done.

603
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Well done, fella.

604
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Well done.

605
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Well done, mate.

606
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Fucking excellent.

607
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
I have a new family.

608
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
I respect.

609
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I really do.

610
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
That is brilliant.

611
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
That was the hardest thing I've done in a long time.

612
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Fuck!

613
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
A big fishy hook for the old man and the fish.

614
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Get in there, boys.

615
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Get in there.

616
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Thank you, Vic.

617
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Thank you.

618
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Very kind.

619
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Finally, the net's come good.

620
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
And that's all Sam Farmer's doing.

621
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
He's been working tirelessly to get that.

622
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I think that Sam's going to be kind of accepted as more a part of the team now.

623
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Shit, love.

624
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Shit.

625
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
That looks heavy.

626
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Yeah.

627
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah.

628
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Yeah.

629
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Yeah.

630
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
Yeah.

631
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Yeah.

632
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Yeah.

633
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Yeah.

634
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
Yeah.

635
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Yeah.

636
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Yeah.

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Yeah.

638
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
That looks heavy.

639
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay, guys.

640
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
The first fish.

641
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Yes.

642
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Second.

643
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Hello.

644
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Good size.

645
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Third.

646
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Second.

647
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
All I wanted was just a fish.

648
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
One fish.

649
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
How many fishes have we got?

650
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Twenty-one!

651
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Gentlemen of the net.

652
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Well done, guys.

653
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Twenty-one little fishies.

654
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Oh, yeah.

655
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Oh, yeah.

656
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh, yeah.

657
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Oh, yeah.

658
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Oh, yeah.

659
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Oh, yeah.

660
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Oh, yeah.

661
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Oh, yeah.

662
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Oh, yeah.

663
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Oh, yeah.

664
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh, yeah.

665
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:27,520
remark

666
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,680
Dishes for the dishes.

667
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Dinner is ready, boy.

668
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Nice.

669
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
It just goes to show you, the reality is, in a survival situation, it's the ultimate

670
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
systematic leveler, there's only one class that matters, survival class.

671
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,420
Sam's determination has been amazing with MNets.

672
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,780
I am really happy that you can see that.

673
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,520
Yes, I couldn't.

674
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
I won't deny it.

675
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,540
I couldn't see it at all.

676
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,680
I just thought, well, you're a big city.

677
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,240
But the big city fan, he's done good.

678
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,160
Sam Farmer, my heart comes off to you, sir.

679
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,480
Well done, you, for having the balls and the determination

680
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
to fix them every time,

681
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,480
because that certainly weren't my cup of tea at all.

682
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,160
Well done, him. Thank you.

683
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,960
I'd just like to say a massive thanks

684
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,440
and a raise like any other to Sam Farmer.

685
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,080
Sam Farmer!

686
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,520
Well done, big fella. Founder of the Fishy Feast.

687
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,880
Here we are. Here we are.

688
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,280
Well made at last, fella.

689
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Last night, the men had a hearty 21-fish supper,

690
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
thanks to Sam Farmer's nets.

691
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
But following the feast, 36-year-old Will

692
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,680
is the only member of the group who's out of bed.

693
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,480
It's, uh...

694
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,560
Up past eight, no-one's awake.

695
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,960
They're gonna make a lot of noise.

696
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,280
It's up past eight.

697
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,920
Sun's been up for two and a half hours.

698
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Normally, I'd finish our morning meeting by now.

699
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
So...

700
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,360
Will's worried the men aren't making the most

701
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,640
of the feast.

702
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,680
They're worried about the energy they got from last night's meal.

703
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
I take it we're all going up.

704
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Morning!

705
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,680
I'm glad you woke me up, pal. I'd have slept in.

706
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Morning.

707
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,680
This is a complete one-off, unique opportunity.

708
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,680
I want to wring out every last possible experience out of it.

709
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I think we need a general camp wake-up call.

710
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,680
It was half past eight and most people were still in bed.

711
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
We sat round this campfire every night and said,

712
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
oh, yeah, I want to go romping round the island,

713
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
I want to catch a piggy, I want to get caiman,

714
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
I want to do traps, I want to do this, I want to do that,

715
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,680
doing all these things, but two and a half hours of daylight's gone.

716
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
You know, I think it's just a bit of a shame.

717
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Are you insisting we get up? No, I'm not insisting.

718
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
I know somebody was upset this morning

719
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
because it was a crescendo of boom, boom, boom, for an hour.

720
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,480
You can bang boxes and kick and...

721
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
It's all you want. We're all grown-ups.

722
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Nobody's telling me what time to get up.

723
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
I know, I'm not telling you... I am finished.

724
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Nobody's telling me what time to get up. I'll get up when I'm getting up.

725
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Vic, you're making it sound like I was doing that on purpose

726
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
to try and wake you up. No, not at all. Were you?

727
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
No, of course not. Then why would I think that?

728
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,680
I just laid there laughing, thinking, that's quite funny.

729
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
You be making noises, you be wanting us to wake up,

730
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
me wanting us to wake up at half past eight,

731
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
you were banging boxes and crashing and banging,

732
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
and I was laughing to myself.

733
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm going to stay in bed and prove a point.

734
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
A bit childish.

735
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
How old are you?

736
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
11am.

737
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,680
The men finally crack on with the day's business.

738
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
We've got a fish!

739
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Having been out overnight,

740
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Sam Farmer's nets are continuing to bear fruit.

741
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
There's another fish below you as well.

742
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

743
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I tell you what, we've got enough fish to eat tonight, so that's good.

744
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,680
How was it? Awesome. Absolutely awesome.

745
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
They're both grinning like Cheshire cats.

746
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
It's got to be good news.

747
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
The bag is full.

748
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
A bit of a tiddler, sorry.

749
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah!

750
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
The yellowfiller bag!

751
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I want tuna!

752
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
I love tuna.

753
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,680
That net's working treat for them, isn't it?

754
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Big tuna.

755
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Ooh, another different type of tuna.

756
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
18.

757
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
18.

758
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Right, filleting.

759
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,680
The key is in the care of these tuna is the firmness of the flesh, see?

760
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Yeah.

761
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Yeah, see, that's gone. Sorry, boys.

762
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
That is gone.

763
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,680
The men are paying a heavy price for their late start to the day.

764
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Oh, look at that.

765
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
We have wasted a lot of fish today

766
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
because we have got pulleys in too late.

767
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Yeah, we don't know. A lot of fish.

768
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
And this one as well.

769
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,680
At the moment, I'm having a real problem with fish getting caught in the net

770
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
going rotten.

771
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,680
You put the nets overnight, the fish could have been caught at one in the morning,

772
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
they could have been caught at 11 last night.

773
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
All of a sudden, you get to 10 o'clock this morning,

774
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,680
you've been sat in a net for 12 hours going off.

775
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,680
It's 11 o'clock and we've only just pulled the fish in.

776
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
I think we need to get out of bed.

777
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Faster.

778
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Get out of bed earlier, yeah.

779
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
I think we'll just have a morning call.

780
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Go, right, 7.30, everyone up.

781
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
I don't want to waste any more fish

782
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,680
because we can't be bothered getting out of bed

783
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
and now checking the nets.

784
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Once again,

785
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,680
the group's food situation looks bleak.

786
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
You need to head around this bit.

787
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,680
With no food in camp, fishing with a rod and line

788
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,680
is now the men's best hope of catching something for dinner.

789
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Don't be too long, mate. We've got a long way back, yeah?

790
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Will is an incredible man for his energy

791
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
and his ability to keep not just motivated

792
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,680
but to keep the enthusiasm to follow his ideas through

793
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,680
when he's running on empty just like the rest of us.

794
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
It's really quite impressive.

795
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm going to head around, OK?

796
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
To get to the best fishing spot,

797
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,680
they must navigate the island's treacherous coastline

798
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
at high tide.

799
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,680
I think one of the most critical skills in survival generally

800
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,680
is just awareness, you know, an ability to kind of assess

801
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,680
and just take your time and think through things

802
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
before you actually act.

803
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
But here's the danger.

804
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,680
The more malnourished, the more their judgement gets impaired

805
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
and that's when they can end up taking risks

806
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
that can put their lives in jeopardy.

807
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Your house is looking a bit tasty down there, isn't it?

808
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Stop, mate. Stop.

809
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,680
Have we left it a bit late?

810
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Right, boys, this is where it's going to get naughty.

811
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Whoo! It's like that big diving board in Sheffield Arena.

812
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Too high.

813
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Too high.

814
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
What's happening, mate?

815
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
We've got some big ones coming, so let's wait.

816
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
The idea is to watch them coming in,

817
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
wait for a flat spot and go for it.

818
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Hold!

819
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Hold!

820
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
There he's gone!

821
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Back!

822
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Oh, shit!

823
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
There!

824
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Whoo-hoo!

825
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Right, step, step, hand, yeah?

826
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Well done.

827
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Next!

828
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
One pierce.

829
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Now pierce. Push off.

830
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Push off, push off, push off.

831
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Hand, hand, hand.

832
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
There we go. Bingo, Stella.

833
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Whoo! Big whirl!

834
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Well, if I were you, I'd come a bit further along.

835
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Camera.

836
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
I can go all the way around.

837
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
There's no hole. There's no hole.

838
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
You can't get all the way around.

839
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Wrong incline.

840
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Vic, I'll not be able to make this with the camera.

841
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
That's OK. I'm just ready for you coming along.

842
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Vic, go across, yeah?

843
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Steady away.

844
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
That's fine. Easy to do that.

845
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
You all right?

846
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
Yep.

847
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Fucking Jesus.

848
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Be careful!

849
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Turn around, face the rocks.

850
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Yeah, check for loose rocks.

851
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Right, aim for the hand, aim for the hand.

852
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
Keep hold, keep hold, keep hold.

853
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
There you go, there you go, there you go.

854
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Holy shit!

855
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
You OK? You OK?

856
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
OK.

857
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
OK, just come up.

858
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Get the fucking camera off!

859
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Get the fucking camera off.

861
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I'm sorry.

862
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Stay still. Stay still.

863
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Are you OK?

864
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Give me a, give me a...

865
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Let's get off the danger area and then assess the catch,

866
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
OK?

867
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
OK, that's nasty.

868
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Will is losing blood and is in a state of shock.

869
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,680
Let's move on before we get stuck again, OK?

870
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Yep.

871
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Dr Pearce needs to get him back to camp urgently

872
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
so he can examine the injury properly.

873
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Son of a bitch.

874
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,680
I tell you what, that was a massive fall.

875
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Totally unexpected.

876
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
To see that cut was pretty scary.

877
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
We'll get your blood done.

878
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Yeah.

879
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
OK.

880
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Will.

881
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Will.

882
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Dude.

883
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
It's actually quite serious.

884
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
Nice house.

885
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Oh, shit.

886
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Dr Pearce can finally make a proper assessment.

887
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
What is that you can see underneath it?

888
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Is that muscle or is that bone?

889
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,680
I think he's severed one of his tendons.

890
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
It's bad.

891
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
I mean,

892
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,680
I wouldn't be happy just to patch that up here.

893
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
No, I wouldn't either.

894
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
No.

895
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Oh.

896
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
No.

897
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,640
is to patch that up here.

898
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,880
That needs a surgical exploration in an operating theatre.

899
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,320
If I have to go, I'm really devastated.

900
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,880
And at the end of the day, Will,

901
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,720
remember you're right-handed, it's your livelihood,

902
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,720
and we've got to be sensible and realistic.

903
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,800
Fuck. Not good at all, this.

904
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,880
OK, guys.

905
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,360
Just give me a minute, yeah? Give me a minute, lads.

906
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,960
He's such a valued part of our team.

907
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,240
If he leaves, I would totally feel gutted.

908
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,680
So I'm dead.

909
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,960
I'm really desperate for him to stay with us.

910
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,640
Knowing Will's injury is serious,

911
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,960
Dr Pearce has no option but to call the emergency paramedic team

912
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,320
for a second opinion.

913
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,400
Do you think he's gone off your arms?

914
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,920
I do, yeah.

915
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,800
I want him to go, in fact.

916
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,280
It's something that can't be dealt with on the island, OK?

917
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
You need a surgeon that's trained,

918
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,320
you need a sterile operating theatre.

919
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,600
It's real no-braining.

920
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,360
He's gone quite deep.

921
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,840
Is it Gors there? OK.

922
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,400
Injury is muscular and not just superficial,

923
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,840
so he needs to be evacuated.

924
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,000
OK, hold on.

925
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,400
ASAP, Ella.

926
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,240
Get your stuff together, OK?

927
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,480
All right, fantastic.

928
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,040
Keep those for me, guys.

929
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,840
After five weeks on the island, Will's time is over.

930
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,000
Smallest things, and it's just a simple fall like that,

931
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,200
and it's cut my experience off.

932
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,960
Oh, mate, I'm so fucking sorry.

933
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
You've been a fucking hero, mate, you really have.

934
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360
Guys, we need to go right now.

935
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,920
I don't care what anyone says,

936
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,960
we've effectively had a leader out here,

937
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,480
and it's been Will's best effort.

938
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
He's done it. He's done it.

939
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,760
It's been Will's best effort here, and it's been Will's.

940
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,840
He's led by example, he's led by inspiration.

941
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,800
Thank you, buddy.

942
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,480
When people can't be asked or don't want to do something,

943
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,080
he's done it himself, and he's filmed the whole thing as well.

944
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,960
The man-spinning machine.

945
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
I think we'll regress to kind of ape men.

946
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,320
Will now, he's gone.

947
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,640
See you soon, Will!

948
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,720
Oh, he's got a sub on, hasn't he? Bless him.

949
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah, I think he's upset.

950
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,600
See you soon!

951
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,400
Good luck, Will. Good luck.

952
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,120
All right, fella? Yeah.

953
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,280
Yeah? No, listen, it's how it works.

954
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,080
You did your best, that's how it works.

955
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,680
I never imagined that I'd be so gutted,

956
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,880
so disappointed, so kind of upset with one of us leaving.

957
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
Especially in the last few days, I've gotten with him so well,

958
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
and I've really made a really good friend of him.

959
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,840
Next time, on the final instalment of The Women's Island...

960
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,680
No supper for us tonight.

961
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,920
I'm starved.

962
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,320
You're doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah. What?!

963
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,840
We are completely dysfunctional as a group.

964
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,040
We need leadership.

965
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,800
Well, you're not here for the team any more.

966
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,840
Are you trying to start an argument? I'm asking that for you.

967
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
You are trying to start an argument. Do you know what?

968
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,040
Jamie, you're a fucking fag.

969
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,440
We're going to end up killing each other by the end of this.

970
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,400
It's going to get really bad.

971
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,720
I'm telling you, I can't get over it.

972
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,080
It's about onions, not onions.

973
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,000
I know the onions.

974
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,640
Theyrada was dead, she's dead, but she's alive.

975
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,000
Well, I don't have a lot of diamonds.

976
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,760
Next time on, you know, thoroughly ousted children?

977
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,200
That's right, I'm going to end up with them all.

978
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,640
You don't know what it's gonna be like.

979
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,840
him des bic cam reported he will quietly leave the gym.

980
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,640
He is ollut since the beginning.

981
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,880
That's a shame.

982
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,440
What do you mean?

983
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,640
What?
