00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello!

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Six weeks ago, I set out to discover whether 14 ordinary British men

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
and 14 ordinary British women could do something extraordinary.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Survive on two remote Pacific islands...

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
..filled with dangerous wildlife...

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
That is a big fucker.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
It came right at me!

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
..at the height of the tropical storm season.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
How on earth are we expected to survive in this?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
What I want to find out is, has all of this cushioning

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
that civilisation has experienced over the last 50 years

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
that I believe is deep within us all?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
In this groundbreaking experiment,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
the castaways faced surviving entirely alone for six weeks.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Holy shit!

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Tonight, I discover how both the islands fared.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You're really on more than nature, I say.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll reveal and explain the techniques

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
that men and women use to survive...

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
..find out how island life affected them...

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I am not the same person who went to the island.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It's the best thing I've ever done.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
..and what it was like when they returned to civilisation.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh!

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
What the hell's going on?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Showered and everything!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No way!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It's absolutely brilliant, babe.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
After 41 days, I returned to the islands

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
to find out how the castaways have stayed alive

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
using only their wits

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
and some basic survival skills.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Is it him?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Such a big part of me is so relieved

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
we've reached this point where we're extracting them.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
This is the most in-depth experiment I've ever done.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Six weeks, height of a rainy season.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Brutal.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Welcome!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Wow, look at you guys.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Well done.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Well done, you.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Thank you.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Well.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Done.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
You.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Amazing.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Thank you.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Genuinely.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I think what's interesting about doing two separate islands,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
one for the men, one for the women,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
is seeing how two very different groups of people

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
cope in the same hardships.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Look at you guys.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I thought I smelled bad.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I mean, that is the smell of honest hard work, isn't it?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Success!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
It's the smell of success.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Thanks for coming back.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Let's have a look at the camp.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
We would like to introduce you to the Croc and Trotter,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
which is the name of our camp.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Guys, this looks incredible.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
It's all right, isn't it?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
You know, this is like out of a movie set, Robinson Crusoe.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
So with this sign here,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I think this is like a symbol of how far we've come.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
So it's no longer a camp, but it's now our home.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Sounds a bit like a pub.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yep.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Correct!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That's what we're doing.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I discovered they'd constructed a fire pit and seating area,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
a communal table,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and individual raised beds...

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
..that even built themselves a staircase.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Because of the torrential rain, that hill was treacherous,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
so one of the first things we did is,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
while everyone else basically built the shelter,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I built the steps.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You know, little things like that

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
where you're trying to conserve energy.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
As a team, we definitely thrived, no doubt about it.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I mean, you only have to go and look round the camp

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
to realise that it was a pretty serious set-up.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Respect.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You know, I know what you guys have been through.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Brutal.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Good effort, you know.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
On the women's island, they took a different approach.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Would you like a tour?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I can't wait to see it.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Coconut.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's our passe.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Made by coconuts that we ate.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
You've eaten a lot of coconuts.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Far too much coconuts.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
The women had made a huge effort

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
to make their camp feel homely and cheerful.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Wow, guys, look at this.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
This is cool.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
It's very cool.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And it's so clean.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
You know, it is not easy to get an island like this clean.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
This is amazing.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
This is way better than I expected.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
And I look at how the men did stuff

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and it was functional, technical.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It didn't have this kind of warmth.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Little touches of decoration, you know.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
To me, it has much more of a heart...

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
..to it.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
This is home.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
The first rule of survival

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
is to find a safe place to build shelter.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Just see the rocks in the distance just there?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That's home.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
That's where we're going.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
The men chose an excellent spot.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Booyah!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Beach!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It was close to the sea,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
which is a great source of food,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
but set back enough from the beach

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
to give the natural protection from the elements.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Because it's elevated,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
this is not really going to get that wet.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Right, what do you want me to do, Paul?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
What we need now are cross members.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Having chosen their location,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
the men set about building shelter

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
to protect themselves and their fire

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
from the frequent tropical storms.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It's got a fairly good canopy.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's got four corners that we can notch off,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
put rope into, cover over the top.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
From my experience in the wild,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
constructing a good shelter is crucial.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Not only to get yourself out of that water,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
but also just for morale.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You know, if you're just getting pissed off

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
all day, all night,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
to have somewhere to hide away,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
get out of it, means so much.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
So, um, these are the dormantries.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
The men went on to build individual covered beds

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
that were raised off the floor

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
to protect them from the jungle critters.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
A group of guys decided that they were going to start

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
throwing up a bed for everybody,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and then you would personalise your own bed

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
by putting a roof on your pitch,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
depth of bed, length of bed, that sort of thing.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The beds were built using A-frames

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and lengths of washed-up rope for their mattresses.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
OK, whose is the best, do you reckon?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Mine.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And that's this one.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
A man's bed is his castle.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I got stuck into my bed, making it as comfortable

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
as I possibly could, cos once I'd got in that bed,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I wanted that to be my personal place for me to go,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
close my eyes and be at home.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So I realised, once they decided to make individual beds,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
pick a decent one, make it a palace.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Are you happy for me to have it, guys?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
By all means, sir.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Are you going to be sad to leave this, Vic?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes, I am, yeah, yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That was my one luxury on this island,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
and a good night's sleep every night.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, God, yes.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
If the beddies are rocking, don't come and rock in.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Oh, Jesus.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
It's really dense up here, so we need to get moving.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
On the women's island,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
establishing a base camp took longer.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
This is the direction where we should be heading in.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The group split, and after getting lost in the jungle...

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I think it's that way.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
..it took them nine days to establish a permanent home

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
with a sustainable water source.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
For the women, it wasn't until their final week on the island

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
that they came up with the idea for a communal bed

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
where they could keep each other warm.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
OK, and then just tie that there. Perfect.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
We felt that it was a really important way

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
of utilising our greatest resource, which are plastic bottles.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And you can probably get six or seven of us on it.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
And it's fully lined.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Can I have a go? Please go and lie on it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I mean, it's not quiet... No, it's not quiet.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
..but it's comfy.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I mean, this is...

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
This is 1,000 times comfier than the male one.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Yes! Yes!

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
The only thing is, you get up in the middle of the night, go for a pee,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
everybody knows you're getting up.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
What have you been sleeping on before this?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Beach. The beach.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Which is brutal.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But it's not bad if you're spooning, Bert.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
No. We love a spoon.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
There were several really good reasons for sleeping as a group.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
There was a sense of safety.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
If there were anything nasty was to come into camp,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
the group was there to deal with it.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You've got to choose your spot now, Georgie.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Mmm, decisions, decisions.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I think we were really happy with spooning in a really sad way.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It was quite a big comfort for a lot of us

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and definitely a way to keep warm.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Nice and warm.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You know, maybe this is a difference between men and women.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The men wanted their space.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
They wanted these individual shelters where they can hide away

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and they go, I'm annoyed with him.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I close my curtains and I'm done.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But actually, community is strength.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I very much anticipated that the women would be very much the homemakers.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
It would be right top of their list to build shelter.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I think it was interesting just how long it took.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
They look pretty good.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
They just didn't have the skills.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
They had to learn these skills by getting things wrong

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
and they got there in the end.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
But one thing the women were better at was making fire.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
They did it much quicker than the men.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
So this is Vesta.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
She was absolutely flaming, but she's decided to go a bit down.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Why Vesta?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Because Vesta is the Roman goddess of the hearth.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
For us, she's been the heart of the camp

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
and the main thing that we've kept going.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
The women used a traditional friction-based method,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
spinning a bow drill to create heat by friction...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Bloody good ember.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
..then blowing on the ember to breathe life into the flame.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Here we go! Oh, my God!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Wow!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It's got fire!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's got fire!

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, we tried all sorts, the bow and the shaft thing,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
holding it and rubbing it up and down like fools

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and sweating onto it and spoiling it.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
We got no smoke or anything.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
To me. To me.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Awesome.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
That learning curve just went like a U-bend. Boom.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
It's gone out of need. Fuck all.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Just basically using the sun to focus there in one point

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
has given us quite a lot of heat.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
It was Kyle that sat most of the second day having a go at it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I mean, that man's determination was unbelievable.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Sat for hours holding his glasses.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Come on.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Get the sticks ready, lads.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Get up there, get up there.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
You've got it, you've got it, you've got it!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Go, go, go!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah!

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
He was the unsung hero. He really was.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And, my God, we thanked him for it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Fucking yes!

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You nailed it.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
You're the hero.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
But the fire didn't help them deal with the sandflies,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
which attack at sunrise and sunset

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
and they feed on the protein in human blood.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, it's swollen.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They were unmerciful.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
They really were unmerciful.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Scabbed.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
They got covered head to foot in sandfly bites

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
and that can have a real demoralising effect.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You're scratching, then things get septic,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
you know, you've got salt wounds, a big no-no.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
They bit constantly.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, constantly being bitten.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You can just see them all flying around, it's horrible.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
It makes me itch thinking about the insects.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
They were everywhere, in people's knickers.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
There was no way you could sit down at all unless you're in the water.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Unless you're in the water where some sort of insect

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
or some sort of bug is not going to absolutely tear your skin apart.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I feel like I'm turning into the fucking Elephant Man.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
If anybody films me, I'll kick off.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You fucking bitch!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Good job I'm not going on a date any time soon.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And neither did the men escape unscathed.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, God!

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Sandfly, seriously.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I'll burn or cut this island down

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
if that's what it means to get rid of them.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
But the islanders came up with some ingenious techniques

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
to ward off the island critters.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You seal your hood round and put your boxer shorts

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
that you've been wearing for four weeks over your face.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
You just sleep in that rigid position for, you know, six hours.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Just put that over like that.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
There he is.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Perfect.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever been through in my life.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You mean you don't love the great outdoors, Jill?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Not when I can't see it,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
cos I've got to sleep with a fucking T-shirt over me face.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I may as well be at fucking home with the lights out.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And the women used some extra resources not available to the men.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
The sanitary bag got misused

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
and we found a few stuck sanitary towels all over your face.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
That's not misused.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They kept them away.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
That's exactly the right use.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I cleanse my face with sanitary towels now.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Now I've run out of cotton pads, you can't complain.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
You're like, oh, sanitary towel, that'll work.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
After six weeks utterly alone,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I've returned to see how the men and women adapted

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
to surviving on their islands.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
When it comes to survival, I often talk about the rule of three,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
which means you can survive three minutes without air,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
three days without water,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
three weeks without food.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
During tropical storm season, rainwater is plentiful.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
As it rained, it used to come off the trees,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
so we used to collect it that way.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
It's running like a bloody tap.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
We nicknamed it the Jungle Tap.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
But once it hits the ground, water is contaminated.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
You've got to purify water properly.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
If you don't, you're going to get sick,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
and groundwater can contain

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
a whole host of nasties.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, my God, that is horrible.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
If you think about it, it's where the animals,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
they come to drink, but also it's where they come to crap.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So we'll fill the reservoir to the max

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and we'll let gravity do the rest.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
With each man needing to drink between two and four litres a day,

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
they invented a filtering system to purify the water before boiling.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
It still doesn't look as clear as I was hoping it would.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
No.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We've put it through several bottles with sand,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
with a bit of a ripped-up T-shirt in the bottom

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
to try and filter out all the crap.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It doesn't taste like piss, does it?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It is like... It tastes like middleweight tea.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Have you learned to hate drinking warm water?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
No, I don't mind it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And actually, it's good.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's really good.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
You don't have to kind of just knock it back.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It's decent water.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The water was not an issue.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And actually, dehydration was your own fault

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
rather than lack of water.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
On the women's island,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
their water source was far more polluted than the men's.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
That is fucking disgusting.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
It is. It really is.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Definitely double filtering there.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Fucking hell.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Their system was simple but effective,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
using one jerry can to filter

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
while the other was constantly on the boil.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
I think it was Jamie's sock, a little bit of charcoal, my bra,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
and literally just dripped it through very, very slowly,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
and within a day, you've got 30 litres of the stuff.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't want to drink the water.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It tastes of poo.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
You drink it, then you gulp,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and then you vomit.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
With water sorted, they now needed to feed themselves.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I ensured they had enough indigenous animals,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
vegetation, and water to keep them alive.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
What they had to do was have the ingenuity

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
to find it, catch it, and kill it.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Welcome.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Before entering this extreme environment,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
they were given basic survival training

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
in what they could hunt and trap.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
These were just regular, ordinary, everyday people in regular jobs.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Diverse jobs, but everyday jobs.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
This is a boa constrictor.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
This guy is edible.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
They do get huge.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
They've been known to take small children.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You can't afford to be squeamish.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Killing your food is a survival reality.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
If it's food, it's fuel.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
You're a testament to British engineering, this will be.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
In my experience, one of the most energy-efficient ways of hunting

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
is trapping.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
If it works.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
From the intricate Cayman box trap,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
which, when set off,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
forms an inescapable prison...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Meow!

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
..to the simple spring-loaded trap,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
which uses a trigger system to ensnare the animal.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
It comes down to feed or water.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Pour a little bit of beer down.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Bingo.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I had this TV view of trapping.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
You make one trap, you catch one animal.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
No, no, no, no.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
OK, ready?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You have to put out a lot of traps,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
you have to keep going back,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
you have to keep going back to them,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
and eventually, if you're lucky and you've done it right,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
you'll catch something.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Right, I'll distract him.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Hey, Mr Croc!

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
But once you've trapped an animal, you need to kill it.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
We need to get a loop over that mouth.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Ooh! Look at that beauty!

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
With the crocodile, the men used a noose to control the jaws

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
so it could be manoeuvred into position.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Watch him, watch him! Go now, go now!

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Then they used their body weight to pin it down.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Come on, all right!

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Yes, mate, yes!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
That's it.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And dispatch as quickly and humanely as possible.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The technique that they used to catch that crocodile

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
was actually textbook.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
It was pretty impressive, because there's no doubt,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
you know, you're faced with the number-one predator on the island.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
It's intimidating.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I felt very, very strongly, like, if we're going to kill stuff,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
we should kill it humanely

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
and we should not waste any scrap of it.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Come on, look at that!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Whoa!

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Mate, get in!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Unbelievable!

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Let the feast begin, boys!

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yes!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
These are some of the trophies we kept.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
We absolutely ate everything.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Seven feet of beautiful crocodile.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
That's all that remains, pretty much, apart from the sign.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Thing is, if you hesitate, you lose.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Set your traps, set multiples of them.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
You've got to be opportunistic.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's great, you're right.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Dosh.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
While some men accepted that killing was necessary to eat...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Hi, sage and onion.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Ooh!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
..one of the things I think the women struggled with

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
was putting aside their instinct to nurture

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
and turning it to an instinct to hunt and to kill.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Hunting and killing has been the biggest eye-opener

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
that I've taken from the island.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Taking a life is never easy,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and for the women, it was a real turning point.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
They overcame one of the hardest psychological obstacles,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
showing they had what it takes to be survivors.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
You can spend a week trying to trap an animal,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
and then the actual killing process is pretty gruesome.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It's actually a really emotional thing.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Using a knife, the most humane way to dispatch an animal,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
one way to dispatch a pig,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
is by severing its jugular veins,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
which renders the animal unconscious.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
It was so hard. It was horrible.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
It took them a long time to embrace the hard reality

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
of this isn't going to be pretty.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
But from that point on, the women, just like the men,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
were able to take their rightful place

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
at the top of the island's food chain.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
While there's plenty to eat on land,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
and you can catch it,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
the most reliable source of food for the men and the women

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
wasn't on the island at all.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
All of the seas around here are literally teeming with life.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
There's something like 500 different edible species of fish,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
and it's why, when it comes to desert island survival,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I always say to people, fish first.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Once you figure out how to catch them,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
you've got a well-stocked larder right on your doorstep.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Oh, look, look, look, look!

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Rays. Fuck, they're shallow, aren't they?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Come on, boys, let's get one of these.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
It's easier said than done

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
when you don't have the right tools for the job.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Stingrays won. Survivors now.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
No, she just lost it!

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Get him behind it.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Oh!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Cut him off.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't think any fish you couldn't, couldn't eat around.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It's rubbish.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I loved the fishing.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
I loved doing the fishing, but I was rubbish at it.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Bastard him.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
That spear's not worth donkey poo.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Fucking rubbish.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Then the reality kicks in that you have no idea what you're doing

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
and hopefully that you're going to be able to clutch at things

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
to make them work.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's why it's called fishing and not catching.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It was a big learning curve.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
It really was a big learning curve.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You fucking beauty!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Look at the size of that bitch!

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
As part of their basic survival kit,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I provided both islands with a handful of fishing hooks.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Oh, Barney, you're an inch or two longer.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
It's directly proportional to the size of my penis.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Which meant they could experiment with improvised rods.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
That idea is so romantic, isn't it?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
To be able to carve your own fishing rod,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
sit there with your stick like a gnome and soak up the sun.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh, I got a big one!

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Whoo!

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Fuck!

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But it was far from romantic, really.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It was a really hard graft.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
She's caught a fish!

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
There it is!

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Daddy brought home the bacon!

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah!

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Oh, I saved everybody.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I was almost like Jesus.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
I fed the thousands with nothing more than a homemade fishing rod.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
In a survival situation, the sea can be a lifesaver.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
But if you don't treat it with respect,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
it can just as easily take you out.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
There he's gone!

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Oh, shit!

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Whoo-hoo!

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I've seen it happen.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
A misjudged tide or a freak wave and it's game over.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Rock fishing can prove deadly.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Best fishing was always in the most dangerous spot.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And bad shit happens really quickly.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It takes 12 months for Christmas to come.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Bad stuff happens that quick.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And that's why rock fishing is considered

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
one of the most dangerous sports in the world.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh, my God!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, shit!

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Literally, within half a second, he was gone like that.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And it was genuinely terrifying.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And I just remember screaming at the top of my voice,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Ross!

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
There's nothing like a successful hunt to lift the spirits.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Is this the first time we've actually had breakfast?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah, I think it is.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Amazing.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
But as I know from experience,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
the island diet can have a few unwelcoming effects.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
The island diet can have a few unwelcome repercussions.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, pardon me.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Sorry.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
God, that was horrible.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I'm going to have to go.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Oh, no, you're not going to be sick, are you?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't know. I don't feel very well. Sorry!

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Pardon me.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Why does that always happen when I'm talking about food?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
That's not what's supposed to happen.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Basically, I've been having explosive diarrhea.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
I would get completely naked, do a poo...

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
..and just run straight into the sea

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
and have a shower and bath in the sea.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
With no modern conveniences on the island,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
the call of nature presented something of a dilemma for the women.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
You were doing a poo in the ocean? Yeah.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
What?! Yes.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Are you kidding me? No.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Why are you shitting in the ocean?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Because it's clean.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Going for a poo.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
A lot of people went in there.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
A lot of people went into the jungle and dug holes.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I have to confess,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
I was really worried about something biting my bum,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
so I used to go just on the water's edge,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
which I know upset a lot of people.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
The men weren't so fussy about where they did their business.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Here comes my esteemed colleague.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I think he might have some good news for the camera.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
I've officially dropped anchor in Poo Bay three times.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh, such a relief. I feel like a new man.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Going in the sea, for me,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
it was absolutely perfect.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So I've started shitting in the bath.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Six weeks after abandoning the men and women

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
on two remote tropical islands,

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
I went back to see for myself how they managed to stay alive.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Shit!

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
It's good to get it off your chest now and again, Barney.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Sometimes the hardest thing about surviving on a island

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
is living with your fellow castaways.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It's fucking immaturity.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's sulking and it's attention-seeking.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
They don't know this is not an enjoyable experience for me.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I fucking hate it.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You pointing a finger at me and saying,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Kyle!

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
and it looks like... Yeah, yeah.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Looks like you're doing fuck-all when it comes to wood.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Before I went into the island, I was worried.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It could go one of two ways.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
When women are great, we're fantastic communicators,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
good at multitasking.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I know we're not finished.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So give me a break, please.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
I'm not saying that, I'm just saying you haven't finished, that's all.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Right.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
When a group of women are bad,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
it's bitchy and backstabbing and really nasty.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Well, you're not here for the team any more,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
you're here for yourself.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Are you trying to start an argument?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm asking, that's what you're saying.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
You are trying to start an argument.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I think I've done quite well to hold my tongue,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
because I could have called her a fucking stupid cunt.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Like I wanted to.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Constantly moaning and grumbling and complaining.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I think, oh, God, if you all do my head in.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
If anything's going to make me leave this island,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
it's the people.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It's the lack of team work.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
I think my major achievement was actually not hitting anybody.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I think one of my concerns for you guys right at the beginning

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
is that, you know, you're such diverse people.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
When the gloves are off because you're tired, you're hungry,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
from my experience, I can be quite explosive.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
And that is hard.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I don't know, you liked an argument, didn't you, Vic?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Did I?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't remember any of that.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I was taking the bones out so we can use them for the next meal.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
All that was left to do with that soup was stir it.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
How difficult can stirring soup be?

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Because you are in such an extreme environment,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
tiny, tiny little things are going to get you agitated.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
To some it would look like you didn't want to do the harder job.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
I would say, fuck you to that person, that's what I'd say.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And I was just like, guys, you're arguing about fucking soup.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
You know what I mean?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Just let's fucking calm down, eh?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
There's no need to be like this.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I really do think that this experience

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
is the ultimate pressure cooker environment.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Living in close quarters like this, it's inevitable.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
You're going to get conflict.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
When there's a little bit too much pressure, you need to let it off.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
You need to have a good swear or a shout or fall out with somebody.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Whether you're right or wrong, it's better.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
It's better.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
But listen, Victor, I'm sure it won't be our last little lock on the horns,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
but no hard feelings, mate.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Not much weather, fella, not much weather.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
If left unchecked, tensions among the men could have torn the group apart,

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
but they came up with their own novel way of dealing with conflict.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
We've had our morning meetings and in that we've had a beef section.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
If anyone has a problem, it's aired to the group, in front of the group,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
and talked about like adults.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
As a result, I think we can all say,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
there's been the odd tiff here and there,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
but nothing more than the lover's quarrel.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Anyone got any beef?

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
What's important is that grievances don't fester.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
If you can shine the light on what you're finding difficult,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
it tends to go away.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Good way to start the day.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Do you think we're getting everything off our chest and everything like that?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Do you think it's working?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Don't want any beef stewing.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Is that why you wanted to emcee, just for that jaw?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
That was it?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I've been thinking about this all night.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I thought so.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
The women devised an altogether different approach

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
to healing rifts in the group.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Island therapy.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I'll start.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Bea, I feel like your positivity is something

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
that I've never come across before.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I am so fond of you, Jules, and I think you're hilarious.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It's cringe.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
One of the most important qualities is actually kindness.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
You know, and it's not something you necessarily immediately think

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
is critical to a survivor, but you live with someone for six weeks,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
and those sort of conditions,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
boy, are you grateful for the person who's kind.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Becky, I think you are absolutely wonderful.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Maybe we didn't always perfectly get along.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
There were times where I'd quite like to have gouged their eyes out

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
or stabbed them in the face,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
but I will always have experienced that with them,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
so forever we'll have this amazing bond.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Harvey, all that time we spent in the jungle together,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I couldn't have got through it without you.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You were so positive.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm so sorry.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm not used to it!

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Arriving on the island with little more than the clothes they stood up in,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
the island's beaches were a rich source of materials

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
for the castaways to put to good use.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
What's this? Yes!

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Look at that.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Not the cleanest teacup in the world.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I'm sure we can give it a wash for them.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
That is amazing!

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
A metal can that we can boil stuff in.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Look what I've found.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
An unopened can of ginger ale.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
No!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And it's in date as well.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh, my God.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
One thing that always staggers me with these desert islands,

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
however remote they are,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
is just the amount of trash you often see washed up on the beaches.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Discarded rubbish offered an opportunity

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
to make life on the islands a little more comfortable.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Hey, lads, look.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Found a pink pear.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Look at these bad boys.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
This is the male version.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
LAUGHTER

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
What's this?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Oh, yes.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Lovely toothbrush.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
That is brilliant.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That is brilliant.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh!

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I've got a pink, kind of 14-year-old girl's toothbrush.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Where else would you do that?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
You take a little bit of burnt wood and stick it in your mouth

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
and then a washed-up toothbrush you've found.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
LAUGHTER

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
But it was effective, actually.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It was very effective.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
It was very effective.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
It was very effective.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
It was very effective.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
It was very effective.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
It was very effective.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
It was very effective.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
It was very effective.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
It was very effective.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
It was very effective.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh, my goodness.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I found me a hair clip!

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
I now have a collection of hair clips from the island.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Another comb!

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Wide tooth!

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Very important.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
The women used scavenged items to turn their camp

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
into a home away from home

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and even created an island hair salon.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
And now...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Bear, don't look too scared.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
LAUGHTER

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
This is where...

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
This is where I'm quite out of my comfort zone.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Bear, when you threw me into that sea,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I was out of my comfort zone!

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
LAUGHTER

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
If it wasn't for all the treasures that the sea brought us,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
I'm not sure we would have been able to do as much as we did.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
LAUGHTER

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Jungle headband.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
That's good, that's a bit more Rambo.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
It's quite...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
You survived my territory,

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
and I've now survived yours.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
LAUGHTER

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
In this hostile environment,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
the castaways were putting their lives in danger on a daily basis.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
There's no doubt with this experiment this island was not benign.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Oh, God!

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
What the fuck was that?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Something just fucked me.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It's a scorpion, guys!

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Everything on the island was dangerous.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
There was nothing safe.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
They faced starvation, dehydration...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You're so weak!

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
..and exhaustion.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
And it was inevitable, over six weeks, that there would be injuries.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Especially in the blistered area.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
The first thing that went through my head when the water can exploded was,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
gosh, that is hot.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
And then the second thing was,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
oh, my God, I don't want to leave the island.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm still standing.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
So, if you can see there, you OK?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah, yeah, I feel a little bit faint.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
You look ever so slightly peaky.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
OK, so don't look, Bex.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Just don't you dare look.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
In case of a serious medical emergency,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
I had a rapid-response team on a 24-hour standby.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
But the islander still felt vulnerable.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Oh, my God.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, my God.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I definitely worried for my life on the island.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Like, genuinely, after the collapse, then I realised,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
yes, we have a support team,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
but it does take them a while to get to us.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
So, yeah, we need to be careful.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
I just got off and I saw everything went black.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
What happens when you extend the amount of time

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
that they're trying to survive for,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
you up the risk ratio exponentially.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
You know, cos now you're making decisions when you're tired,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
you're dehydrated, you're starving,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
and so much can happen in those last few weeks.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Be careful!

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Babe, babe, babe, babe!

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Any incident is a serious incident

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
when you're playing around with Mother Nature.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
The power of the water...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Ah! Ah-ha! You OK? You OK?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
OK.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Oh, shit!

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It was a hell of a fall.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
See that? Yeah.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That is almost... Oh, that's tendon.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
It was so close to the end, to making it,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
but it wasn't to be, you know.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Once evacuated from the island,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
cameraman Will was flown to the nearest hospital.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
The plastic surgeon,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
has done an awesome job.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
I had cut through a muscle

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
that controlled the wrist,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
so I'm going to have a good scar.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Erm...

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
But...

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I don't know. Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Everything's fine.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Whoa! Look at that!

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Carbs and veg!

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
The smell...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Honestly, it's like nothing else.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's absolutely heartbreaking.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
To have not made it to the end.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
This kind of makes up a great little bit.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
After six weeks on the island,

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
ten men and ten women made it through to the end.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And now having survived...

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Looks like a tornado!

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
That is terrifying!

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
..they were about to return to civilisation.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
OK, come on, then, give us your highs and lows.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Literally, just to get to the end

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and finally be watching the sunrise

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
of what will be my last day on the island,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
that was just overwhelming.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
We got past strangers, we got past friends,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and we became family.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Really do feel like you can conquer anything

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
when you're all together.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
When we're going back home, what is there to stop us?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Nothing else can really stand in our way.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
You know, you've got light in your eyes

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
and it's in all of you.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
And you only get that glint

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
when you go through the mill,

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
come out the other side of it.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Guys, I think you're amazing.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
It's time to get you off this island.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah!

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Let's go, boys.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah!

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
So Bear dropped us off on this island

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
and it's just a random island.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Bear then come back

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and he was picking me up off our island.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And it was such a strange sensation

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and I think quite a lot of the other lads felt like that as well,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
like that was our ground now.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Whoo, boys!

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
Return to civilisation was weird.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
You spent a lot of the time wishing for that day to come

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and dreaming about it and being like,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
when that boat turns up, it's going to be amazing.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Oh, we did it, guys!

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
But then the reality was I wasn't ready.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I wanted to stay.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I wanted to stay with these amazing women

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
and living in this amazing experience.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Well done, boys.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Well done.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Let's grab a tackle and get out of here, yeah?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Knowing that the time was up

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and that this great, great, great adventure we were on

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
was coming to an end,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
that was really sad, that, yeah.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
I'm so heartened to arrive here

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
and actually see real, genuine love, care and community.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
And they don't look emaciated and broken.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
They look actually healthy and smiling and proud.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And pride is something that is hard won

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and they've done it the hard way.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh, the relief. Absolute relief.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Just to know that we were finally going to get back to reality

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
where we can fill our bellies,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
it was just, yeah, amazing.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah!

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
You've done it. You've done it.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
It's, like, so happy.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
For the men's arrival, a special welcoming party awaited.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
In they come.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
In the form of injured cameraman Will.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Will you?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I could see all their faces on the side of the boat

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and I kind of gave them a little wave

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and they all kind of, like, cheered and jumped out,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
came running over.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
It's giving me goosebumps now to think of it.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Wow, you all stink!

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
It was, you know, it was really good

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
to kind of get the team back together.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
After spending six weeks cut off from the world...

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Oh, it's so weird to touch.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
..re-acclimatising was going to take time.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
It feels...

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
I'm going to need to train myself.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I can't remember how to work it.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
I knew this was going to happen, I'd forgotten how to work it.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It feels so weird!

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Fucking hell, it looks weird!

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
That first phone call.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I was really looking forward to it,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
but not the emotional rollercoaster that I knew was going to come.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, purely speaking to my missus just pushed me over the edge.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Never, never been like that in my life that I can remember

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
other than being a kid sobbing over bugger all.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Oh, God, your voice is beautiful.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
My bit of squeeze on the phone, it was lovely.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It was really nice.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Hello, baby!

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm so happy to talk to you, I cannot tell you.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Do I say good to hear your voice?

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
It was so strange and weird and intense

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and I really loved it.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I really loved it.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
I didn't realise that when I spoke to my mum and heard her voice,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
just how powerful that was.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Hello?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Mum!

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Is that Mummy?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Oh, Mummy!

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I wasn't upset, I was just so happy.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I've never been so happy.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
My mum's pissed me off since being back.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
She's annoying, but, you know, I'm not going to try and forget that.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I'm going to take that moment with a phone call

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
because, actually, you realise that she's not annoying,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
she's the best.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Hello?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Hello!

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
Hearing my daughter's voice after six weeks was just beautiful.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Oh, baby, I've missed you so much!

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
And kind of made me realise what I have,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
how rich my, kind of, life at home is.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
The truth is, you cannot go on this island, endure,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
and leave the island the same person.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
It is a life-transforming experience.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Oh, my God!

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
After being stripped of all modern comforts,

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
the men and the women had an appreciation for the simplest things.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Oh!

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Returning to the civilisation was really weird.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Whoo!

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
I got sort of visual indigestion.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Oh!

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Oh!

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Oh, my God!

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Look at this!

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Get in front of the shower and everything!

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Get in the toilet!

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I can't get over how beautiful it is!

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Argh!

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Oh!

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Fucking hell!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Oh, God!

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
No way!

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Everything that you totally took for granted

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
is suddenly the most amazing thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Oh, my God!

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Argh!

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
You know, we're a few months on now,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
and I'm still just so grateful of everything.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Every silly thing.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Sitting on a chair, you know.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Where does that chair come from?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
It's amazing.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I can't believe I'm talking about a chair.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Wow!

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Yay!

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
That looks great.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
After weeks of surviving on very little food,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
the men and the women were given a strict diet to follow

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
to allow their bodies time to recover.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Wow!

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
The starter.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
That better be the starter. Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
We were instructed that we would be given a meal plan,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
and I thought the meal plan would have been a lot bigger.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
It's so good.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
It's so good.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I just wish it was four times as big.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Just can't get it in quick enough.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh, my God.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh!

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Want more food?

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Six.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
I have secret videos of me and Belinda

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
when we got off the island scoffing Mars bars and drinking beer.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Oh!

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Have a crisp.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
How are they?

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
That night when I come off the island,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I went against the rules

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
and I ate, I think, two or three steaks,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
pina coladas, beers.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I went to town.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
That night, I went to bed,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
three o'clock in the morning,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
it was like someone had opened up a tap in my arse,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
and I never got off the toilet until about ten o'clock the next day.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I think I lost about six stone in one sitting.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
I think what I gained from the island

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
was a sense that the human spirit is unbreakable.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Yes!

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
It made me feel fantastic.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I was 25 again.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
For six weeks, it was great.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Fantastic.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Thank you.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I am not alone.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I am not the same person who went to the island.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I was really shy.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I was just scared of what people would make of me.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
But the island, it helped me find friends,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
like, lifelong friends.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I think we had an amazing bond.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
We've shared experience of that,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
which we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
She floats!

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
What? They've made her out?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
It's that feeling of living on the edge

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
and living in the extremes.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
But still being really happy.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
That's what amazed me the most.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
100% I would do it again.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I loved it.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I think, probably, the experience of the island,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
for me, was life-changing

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
and incredibly humbling.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I just think it's the best thing I've ever done.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Full stop.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Seeing them at the end, proud of what they've done,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
tight as a group, actually is inspiring.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
And, ultimately, they learned, never give up.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Every single one of them said that.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
They said, this is about just being bloody-minded

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
and not giving up and sticking with it.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And, really, that's the heart of a great survivor.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
CHEERING

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
