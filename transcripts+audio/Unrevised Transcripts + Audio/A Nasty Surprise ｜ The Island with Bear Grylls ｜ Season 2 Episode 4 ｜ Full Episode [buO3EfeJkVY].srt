00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,640
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,640
be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,500
everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:48,180
strength the winds of day who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the

6
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:57,840
women's island this time it'll be harder than ever

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:09,780
hunt for food find water and build shelter living on the island in the middle of tropical storm

8
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:26,880
season when pitted against the extremes of nature and these Monday women got what it takes to survive

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:47,100
four days ago 14 British women were cast away on this remote uninhabited Pacific Island

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,660
already one woman has left the island I need to go

11
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,980
who's up for this

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,280
some of the group stayed behind at the makeshift camp whilst an expedition party went in search of

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:14,160
a permanent base with a sustainable water source it's not salty but with no idea how to get back

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,700
to the others they are now lost in the thick of the jungle and are completely out of water

15
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,900
we have nothing to drink we don't know where we are

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,520
the women left behind have just rain water to drink their fire has gone out and panic is setting in

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,480
with both groups now starving and critically dehydrated their time on the island could be

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,360
over before it's really begun it's day four

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
the five women left in camp have been waiting for over 24 hours for the others to return from their

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
expedition

21
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:10,080
I feel dreadful honestly I feel absolutely dreadful I never thought I would be so desperate

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,240
for food and water we all want to get out of this camp but we know the other group are coming back

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,180
for us we can't set off because we'll lose them the women are trying to relight their fire to

24
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,900
purify water from a muddy puddle but their wood is damp

25
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,280
that's it

26
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,800
next it's moving oh every time what the hell are we doing there's actually just another

27
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,160
Groundhog Day of the same it's like the best camping ever isn't it the best camping

28
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,000
every time camping twice I don't like it

29
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,640
however bad your situation is you have to dig deep and find that inner strength to stand any chance of surviving the adapted nature of magn Tookhealth tours are nowScreenreviews.com

you'll get started until you hit the video this one walk

34
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,940
surviving. You know, simple principles that really make a big difference, and one of those

35
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,780
is positivity, positivity, positivity.

36
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,500
I might as well, honestly, I might as well have gone and sat in my horse's field for

37
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,660
five days and not eaten, but just sat in the muddiest part of the horse's field, but the

38
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,180
difference is I might have had a horse for company.

39
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:28,180
I don't actually mind, because I love extremes of weather. I like roaring wind and lightning

40
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,180
and torrential rain and...

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh, lovely. I'm pleased for you. Seriously, I'm really chuffed for you.

42
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,460
I've always wanted an adventure, and I thank God I haven't done that much for myself over

43
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,060
the last 55 years. Should have done more. Should have seen more.

44
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,860
I get really wound up over the most stupid things. Like, you know when you buy expensive

45
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,860
toilet roll and then you tear it and it doesn't tear along the perforations? That really winds

46
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
me up.

47
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,620
I try to stop myself talking a lot, but I do like to think that other people can get

48
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,620
away with it in edgeways, you know what I mean?

49
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,220
This is day four now without any food, so we're really going to feel it today.

50
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,180
Earlier, the women found some yucca, a type of potato. Mother of two, Julie, has decided

51
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,860
to peel it, despite not having a fire to cook it on.

52
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,180
Oh, now, do you know what? I've just wasted that now.

53
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,180
But we could have boiled it in soup, that's what Beth was saying.

54
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,180
I would please leave the yucca.

55
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,180
If she goes on about those potatoes anymore, I'm going to stab her.

56
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,180
After 24 hours without a drink, the expedition party are dehydrated, hopelessly lost, and

57
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
wandering directionless.

58
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Walking is painful now, physically and mentally.

59
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,180
I just hope we can find a drink.

60
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:17,180
I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.

61
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,180
Careful here, guys, it's really slippery.

62
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Oh, shit.

63
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,180
Are you all right?

64
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
Super slippery.

65
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Really slippery.

66
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
Oh, God.

67
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Oh, .

68
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Hey.

69
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Who was that?

70
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
That was me.

71
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Oh, my God, there's a caiman.

72
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
That is a big .

73
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
Oh, yes, I can see it.

74
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
Straight ahead.

75
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Oh, shit.

76
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Oh, my God, that's .

77
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah, it's enormous.

78
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
It's watching us, though.

79
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
We actually, I just can't, I literally must have walked past his nose by that much.

80
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Didn't spot him.

81
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Did we throw things at his hip?

82
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
No.

83
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
No.

84
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size is the most likely

85
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
to die.

86
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Oh, my God.

88
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Oh, my God.

90
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Oh, my God.

91
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Oh, my God.

92
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
Oh, my God.

96
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,020
Though potentially deadly to humans, a crocodile of this size could provide tens of thousands

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,180
of calories for the women who have barely eaten in days.

98
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Billy Big Balls, that.

99
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
That is a serious Billy Big Ball.

100
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm not going for that one for dinner, then.

101
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Not tonight, not without a fire.

102
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
We wouldn't tackle that unless we don't have a sharp knife on us.

103
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
We'll be back for you, men.

104
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
Sleep with one eye open.

105
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:21,420
With hunger and dehydration sapping their energy and with hunting equipment left at camp,

106
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,180
the women decide to walk away from this potentially deadly crocodile.

107
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
A life-saving feast.

108
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Right, let's get out of here.

109
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Nothing easy on this.

110
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
Hey, it's all right.

111
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
It's all right.

112
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
It's all right.

113
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
That's it.

114
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
That's it.

115
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
That's it.

116
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Well done.

117
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,180
As we know, caiman can take off a leg, an arm, drag you into the water, drown you,

118
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
eat you.

119
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Not great, really.

120
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,180
So we all want to be out of here as fast as possible.

121
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,180
And as an exit operation, we're doing quite well.

122
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Oh, darn you, dear.

123
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Yeah.

124
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
Too late.

125
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Too late, baby.

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
Too late, baby.

127
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Too late, baby.

128
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
Too late, baby.

129
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
It's too late.

130
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,180
For these women to succeed they've got to have faith.

131
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,180
They've got to persevere and reunite because there's power in numbers.

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,180
My mantra is lead no man behind.

133
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,180
It's that sort of attitude that's going to make the critical difference for them.

134
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,180
I've got a beach on my left.

135
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Oh, no.

136
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Let's get on that.

137
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,180
Let's get an orientation.

138
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,540
The women have been trekking through the jungle for two hours,

139
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,440
but instead of finding camp,

140
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,860
they've stumbled upon another beach on the north of the island.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
This is so hard.

142
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,360
No-one knows what the right decision is.

143
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,500
It's so thirsty.

144
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,400
I've never been so dehydrated in all my life.

145
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm thinking about drinking seawater.

146
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
I know you can't, but I'm not...

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,940
The women scavenge the area and strike lucky.

148
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,180
We found coconut!

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,420
Oh, my God!

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,460
It's just enough to keep them going.

151
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,760
Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's do it.

152
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,660
As they head back into the jungle to try and find the others once more.

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,700
At camp, the damp conditions are proving problematic.

154
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,620
I really...

155
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,340
I was, of course, trying to say,

156
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,060
let's start another fire.

157
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,320
It's finding the dry stuff.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,660
There's no sun. We can't see the sky.

159
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
Oh, but look at your little hands.

160
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,180
My hands. I'm like...

161
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,540
Can you see?

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,540
Like, look.

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,520
It's just from the wetness.

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
They're going to crack.

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm in agony.

166
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,960
I've achieved everything I wanted to in my profession.

167
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,620
I'm really happy with where I've got to,

168
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,240
but I think my job is starting to define me,

169
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,740
and I don't want that.

170
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,220
I want to find out who I am again.

171
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,580
I think I have a need for adventure.

172
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,380
I just feel so driven to do something completely different.

173
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,600
It's crazy.

174
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,720
I can't let it get in my head.

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,460
You can't let it get in your head.

176
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:04,860
No.

177
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,360
It's important to be positive.

178
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,140
Right.

179
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,060
It will work out. It will.

180
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,620
We're about to work out how to make a great shelter today.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,580
Unable to make fire without dry wood,

182
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,340
a shelter will protect the women from the elements

183
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,860
while they wait for the others to come back for them.

184
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,060
Push it down. Push that down.

185
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,780
No. No, this, the top one. Push that down.

186
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
I'll tell you what, there really is strength in numbers.

187
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,800
You really feel that there's so much more work

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
and so much more pressure on you

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
when there's just a small amount of you.

190
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,940
Oh, shit. That's it. There we go.

191
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Now, with just five of us, it feels pretty lonely, actually.

192
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,940
Half an hour later,

193
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,180
and the shape of a shelter is almost complete.

194
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,180
It looks pretty good.

195
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Oh, for fuck's sake.

196
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Positivity, positivity, positivity.

197
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,180
The expedition party left what they've nicknamed Coconut Beach

198
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
nearly two hours ago,

199
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
and they are trekking into the thick of the jungle,

200
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
trying to find a camp.

201
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
No, we're going back on ourselves. We need to go that way.

202
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,080
There's the other coast beach.

203
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,080
With the afternoon temperature rising to over 30 degrees...

204
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm so thirsty.

205
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,080
..their need for water is more critical than ever.

206
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,080
My biggest motivation is to get to the others.

207
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Convinced they're close to camp,

208
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Georgie and Lauren go ahead to recce their surroundings.

209
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
We're just looking.

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
They're not going anywhere.

211
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
We're going back to where we are.

212
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
We're back to where we are.

213
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,080
No fucking way.

214
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Can't be.

215
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
We are?

216
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
No, we can't be.

217
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
We haven't done one massive se...

218
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Yeah.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Really?

220
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,080
The expedition party have spent all day in the searing heat,

221
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,080
only to find they've walked in one big circle,

222
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
back to Coconut Beach.

223
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,360
in one big circle, back to Coconut Beach.

224
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
Guys, do you want to come down?

225
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
OK.

226
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,600
Without a GPS or visual landmarks to guide us,

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,520
human beings are naturally prone to walk in circles,

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
even when we're convinced we're going in a straight line.

229
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,520
Put dehydration into the mix, which slows down brain function

230
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,120
and the women find themselves in crisis.

231
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,960
OK, so there's some bad, bad news.

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,400
We're back where we were.

233
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,920
If the women don't find a proper water source soon,

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
their time on the island will end.

235
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Bad news is we fucked up and we've just done a massive circle

236
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,680
and we've wasted a load of energy for nothing.

237
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
How the fuck did that happen?

238
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
All too easily.

239
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,200
We're in the jungle.

240
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,640
Got no fucking reference point.

241
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
And we're tired and dehydrated.

242
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
I vote we bed in for the night.

243
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
I think I'm going to cry, George.

244
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,240
I think I'm going to cry, don't you?

245
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,680
This is absolutely fucking ludicrous.

246
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
Physically, I don't know, people have got holes in their feet.

247
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,960
I have now.

248
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
We can't sustain this.

249
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,160
Oh, my God, what are we going to do back at the camp?

250
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,160
Four days ago, I abandoned a group of ordinary British women

251
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,960
on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.

252
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,480
After separating over 24 hours ago,

253
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,720
the expedition party are desperately trying to get back to camp.

254
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,880
But disorientated by the jungle,

255
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
they remain in the north of the island.

256
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,720
The women left waiting at camp have no fire to purify water

257
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
and are also worryingly dehydrated.

258
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,400
We've been drinking water from a roof by wild animals.

259
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,600
Mum of two, Julie, has been down at the rocks

260
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
washing the women's muddy underwear.

261
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,600
There's only five of us here at the moment.

262
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,920
The other group have got lost.

263
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
We've no idea where they are.

264
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,440
A couple of our groupers are just moaning all the time.

265
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,960
I mean, for God's sake, it's supposed to be survival.

266
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,240
It's not supposed to be a holiday.

267
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
You know what I mean? We knew it was going to be tough.

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,040
Facing a second night isolated from the others...

269
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,000
What the fuck?

270
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,320
..the claustrophobic jungle environment

271
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,720
is testing the women's mental strength.

272
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,920
But it's been very difficult to stay positive.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
I don't feel we've got anything.

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I don't have anything to look forward to.

275
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,320
I just feel like we've been dumped.

276
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
Can I say something positive?

277
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
No, fuck off.

278
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,360
I don't feel too bad, you know?

279
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,800
And I just think it can only get better.

280
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,280
To be fair, Julie, you really haven't gone on any expeditions to get anything.

281
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,960
You've kind of conserved the energy by staying in camp the most of the time.

282
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,000
You are good at talking the talk, let's do this, let's do that,

283
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,600
but actually actively doing it is a different story.

284
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,760
Maybe that's why you're feeling so good.

285
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,720
I appreciate it.

286
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,080
Everybody is really fucking pissed off.

287
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,720
All I said was a bit of positivity.

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
I've spent fucking hours rearranging wet knickers

289
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,680
and washing all around this camp.

290
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,880
I don't want you to do that, Julie!

291
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,520
And squeezing it out and hanging it up for you.

292
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,560
I've been biting my tongue all the time.

293
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
You don't want me to do it?

294
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Personally, I feel that constantly wringing out people's knickers

295
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,880
that aren't even here in other clothes is futile.

296
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,040
The group dynamics of these five people is not working.

297
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,840
Yeah.

298
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,960
It's not productive.

299
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,760
And I'm sat here thinking, I am stuck with this.

300
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,760
But we collected it at night as well, Julie, but you just walked with us.

301
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,880
How the fuck do you keep a fire going then?

302
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
You're not listening to me, are you?

303
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Do you know what? I'm not, you're right.

304
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,040
What I'm saying is, we should collect wood and...

305
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,640
So, I'm doing the selfie now,

306
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,760
because you really need to know how I'm feeling.

307
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,680
It's really hard.

308
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,000
I just can't get enough of the photoshoots.

309
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
We can't eat.

310
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,240
Because we have no fire.

311
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,060
I don't know where everyone else is, the other group have gone missing and I'm really worried

312
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:57,580
about them, but I'm just questioning how on earth are we expected to survive in this?

313
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,000
On Coconut Beach in the north of the island, the expedition party remain out of water and

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,880
have decided to stay the night.

315
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,120
They're building a makeshift shelter.

316
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,820
We've basically spent two days walking for four and a half hours, that's nine hours in

317
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,120
total we've spent walking around this bloody island trying to get back to where we started.

318
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Everybody's very dehydrated.

319
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,320
We've not had actual water for two days, it's just, it's ridiculous.

320
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
It's absolutely ridiculous.

321
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
And then the other side would go like that?

322
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Yeah, brilliant.

323
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
And then the other side would go like that?

324
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,820
Yeah, brilliant.

325
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,380
After spotting a storm on the horizon, the women scavenge the beach for containers to

326
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,380
collect rainwater, their only hope of rehydrating.

327
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,380
We're going to have to support the bottles and this polystyrene thing so that they're

328
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
upright and they don't spill.

329
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,660
And we may have to keep it behind the slug so that the tide doesn't wash it out.

330
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,140
Finding fresh water is so important.

331
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,800
That combination of very oppressive 30 degree heat plus the humidity, you know, over 90%

332
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,180
of the time, it can easily mean the women get through a litre of water an hour.

333
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
That is a lot.

334
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
Unless they find water, I reckon the women only have one more day.

335
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
As night draws in, the women abandoned at camp are attempting to light a new fire to

336
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
purify their muddy rainwater.

337
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Remember, all we're doing now is trying to make a hole.

338
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
It's out, it's out.

339
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Oh, fuck's sake.

340
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
It's out.

341
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,180
It's out.

342
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
It's out.

343
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
It's out.

344
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
It's out.

345
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
It's out.

346
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
It's out.

347
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
It's out.

348
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
It's out.

349
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
It's out.

350
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
It's out.

351
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
It's out.

352
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
It's out.

353
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,180
It's out.

354
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
It's out.

355
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
It's out.

356
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
It's out.

357
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
It's out.

358
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
It's out.

359
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
It's out.

360
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
It's out.

361
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
It's out.

362
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
It's out.

363
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
It's out.

364
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
It's out.

365
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
It's out.

366
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
It's out.

367
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
It's out.

368
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,180
It's out.

369
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
It's out.

370
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
It's out.

371
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
It's out.

372
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
It's out.

373
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,180
It's out.

374
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
It's out.

375
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
It's out.

376
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
It's out.

377
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,180
It's out.

378
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,180
It's out.

379
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
It's out.

380
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
It's out.

381
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
It's out.

382
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
It's out.

383
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
It's out.

384
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
It's out.

385
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,180
It's out.

386
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
It's out.

387
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,780
All day, Julie's been at me, non-stop.

388
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,660
I've come on this experience to try new things,

389
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,340
to push my comfort zones.

390
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,780
Hello?

391
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,380
Guys?

392
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,140
Can someone shine their light over here?

393
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,140
Cos I swear I'm hearing noises.

394
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,340
Please, it's like a...

395
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,220
Is someone moving?

396
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,820
It's coming close to me, please!

397
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,220
It's Julie!

398
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,020
Oh, fuck my life.

399
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,220
Oh, shit.

400
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,540
On Coconut Beach, the storm is still in the distance,

401
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,420
and the dehydrated women are pinning all their hopes

402
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,140
on their makeshift containers collecting rain.

403
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,020
I've never actually wanted water so much in my life.

404
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Check this lightning out behind me.

405
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Yes!

406
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
It's so cool.

407
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,180
I don't know if you can actually see the line of lightning.

408
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,980
Look, I feel like a weather girl.

409
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,020
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

410
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,100
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

411
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
I'm not sure if you can actually see the line of lightning.

412
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,100
And here we have...

413
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,100
a big, fuck-off, shiny storm.

414
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,140
And to the north, we have a storm.

415
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,140
And just there, we've got a bolt of lightning.

416
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
And I imagine around here, in just a moment,

417
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,140
we're going to have a bolt of lightning.

418
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
And I imagine just about there,

419
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,220
we're going to have a bolt of lightning.

420
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,500
To the right.

421
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
It's from cloud to cloud.

422
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,420
In a moment, we're going to have a strong north-easterly bolt of lightning.

423
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Right there.

424
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,100
Hang on, we're having a few technical difficulties.

425
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Thank you, Bob.

426
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,260
11pm. With the storm still a way off,

427
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,540
the women bed down for a long night under their makeshift shelter.

428
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,380
I can see the rain on this side.

429
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,740
All lights off.

430
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,580
Nighty night.

431
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,260
Bloody hell, have you farted in my face again?

432
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,140
Sorry, I did.

433
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,180
It's 5.30am and the storm has finally hit the island.

434
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,380
The women are hoping their containers are full of rainwater.

435
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,860
We've just had the most uncomfortable sleep of our lives.

436
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,040
It's just a nightmare.

437
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,780
I just hope we can get some water in as soon.

438
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,840
Can I just share something with you, everybody?

439
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,980
Really bad news, we have no water

440
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,160
because the tide has washed our bottles away.

441
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,320
Nothing.

442
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:50,940
Fuck.

443
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,560
Fuck.

444
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,860
Oh, fuck.

445
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,980
I feel like I could cry right now.

446
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,900
I seriously think I could cry.

447
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,040
I think I need a little shit.

448
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,740
After almost 48 hours with hardly anything to drink,

449
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,540
the women sourced just a handful of coconuts.

450
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,980
Oh, my God, this one's cold!

451
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,800
Ah!

452
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,700
But with only enough liquid to have a few sips each,

453
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,160
one woman is finding it all too much.

454
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,220
You all right, Kate?

455
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,620
Just struggling.

456
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm really struggling, guys.

457
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,460
Come on, come on, come on.

458
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Give some love.

459
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
I'm really, really missing my girl.

460
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,420
I've decided to do this because, having been made redundant four times,

461
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,380
it left me feeling worthless and a burden on everybody.

462
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,460
And I wanted to set myself a challenge

463
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,620
and do something that was extremely difficult,

464
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,740
but that I had to do, and that I can't walk away from it.

465
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,820
I have more confidence in myself.

466
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,020
I make my children proud of me.

467
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,620
I make my husband, Chris, proud of me.

468
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,700
I just feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew.

469
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,740
No, not at all.

470
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm with God, you are doing brilliant.

471
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,740
You are doing absolutely brilliant,

472
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,740
and they're going to be so proud of you.

473
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
I know.

474
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
I just want to speak to Chris.

475
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,340
I know.

476
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,540
And have him say, keep going.

477
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,340
You can't do everything through your kids and your husband.

478
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,300
You have to have some me time.

479
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,540
But I like doing everything through them.

480
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
OK, well, that's cool.

481
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,220
I think initially, when people get marooned,

482
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,860
it's all about the fun.

483
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,660
The physical, the fact that they're tired,

484
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
and they're hungry, and they're hurting.

485
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,300
But after a while, people become accustomed to that.

486
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,380
But then the battle becomes something much more meaningful.

487
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,620
Actually, the fact that you're missing your loved ones.

488
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,500
And those battles can be much harder.

489
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm so thirsty.

490
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,780
I haven't managed to find any water.

491
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm so thirsty.

492
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Look at that.

493
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,780
The good news for the women is that in tropical storm season,

494
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,540
the weather can change in an instant.

495
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Guys, guys, bring your pots.

496
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,460
It's running like a bloody tap.

497
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,340
The return of the rain proves to be their salvation.

498
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Yes.

499
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
Woo-hoo.

500
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Yes.

501
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
First in the jungle.

502
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Ah.

503
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Watch my mouth, they think.

504
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
Oh, my god.

505
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
Oh, my god.

506
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
This is amazing.

507
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Wow.

508
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
Cheers.

509
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
Cheers.

510
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Oh, my god.

511
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
That is just the best feeling.

512
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
Yeah, baby.

513
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
From the most miserable situation to the most joyous situation.

514
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
Yeah, see?

515
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
We go up, we go down, we go up, we go down.

516
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:52,620
We were right through the floor down, and now we're elated.

517
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Rehydrated.

518
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Time to dive.

519
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
And with bottles full of water.

520
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
And we came down this one.

521
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,620
The expedition party set off.

522
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Confident they'll finally rescue the others.

523
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Okay, so we're on the right track.

524
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
In the jungle.

525
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,620
The mighty jungle.

526
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
The lion sneaks tonight.

527
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Go.

528
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
A-wimboing.

529
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
A-wimboing.

530
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
A-wimboing.

531
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
A-wimboing.

532
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
A-wimboing.

533
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,620
A-wimboing.

534
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
A-wimboing.

535
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
A-wimboing.

536
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,620
A-wimboing.

537
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
A-wimboing.

538
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
A-wimboing.

539
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,620
A-wimboing.

540
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
A-wimboing.

541
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
A-wimboing.

542
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,620
A-wimboing.

543
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
A-wimboing.

544
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
A-wimboing.

545
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,620
A-wimboing.

546
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
A-wimboing.

547
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,620
A-wimboing.

548
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,860
It's the women's fifth day on the island.

549
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,620
And the two groups have been separated for over two days.

550
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Spirits are buoyed with bottles full of rain water,

551
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,100
but the expedition party are going round in circles,

552
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,940
trying to return to camp

553
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
to rescue the women waiting.

554
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
We want to stay in a straight line.

555
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Nobody's disagreeing with you.

556
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
We will have to make little diversions.

557
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
No, that way.

558
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Mum of two, Kate, remains desperately homesick,

559
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
missing her family.

560
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Just doing my head in.

561
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Because I'm not doing another night in this jungle like this.

562
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
That will be it for me, and I've made that decision.

563
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
If we don't make it back... You feel that strongly about it now?

564
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Yep, and I know the people who matter to me the most

565
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,940
won't care if I come home early, to be honest.

566
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Kate, calm down. We're going the right direction.

567
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
It might not be... I'm not talking to you.

568
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
..like a path. I'm talking to George.

569
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,940
I know. Fucking attitude and a half, you do.

570
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
And you can kiss my fucking arse.

571
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,940
If these women are going to survive, they've got to learn quickly

572
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
how to work together as a team.

573
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Pulling together is paramount in times of crisis,

574
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
and the truth is we always survive better

575
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
when we're together.

576
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,940
When we cooperate and when we don't fight.

577
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
Um, there's only... Please, no negativity.

578
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
We just need to keep on this positively.

579
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
I know you've got a really bad attitude, Kate.

580
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I haven't. I'm just fed up.

581
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,940
You're speaking to everyone with a really bad tone,

582
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,940
so can everybody please stop arguing?

583
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Because it's really not helping.

584
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
But maybe we should just, for the next ten minutes,

585
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,940
all of us just say completely nothing

586
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
and just concentrate on walking and following Fee.

587
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
No, that way.

588
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
Guys, I think we need to go that way.

589
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

590
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Silence.

591
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,940
I'm asking a few group of women to keep silent.

592
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,940
We lasted literally ten...

593
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,940
Everyone, good idea. Ten seconds.

594
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,940
At camp, the group have spent over two days with no food,

595
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,940
drinking just small amounts of rainwater,

596
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
waiting for the expedition party to return.

597
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,940
And damp conditions have brought out the jungle critters.

598
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Like, right now, all my arse is proper itchy.

599
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,940
It's only got a few bites, but above it, my face, my hands...

600
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Shiaz, we've just looked at her arse.

601
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Oh, yeah, we have just looked at her bum.

602
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,940
The rain last night was ridiculous.

603
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Like, I was just...

604
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm so ill that I just need to sleep.

605
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Like, my throat, I can't swallow.

606
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
I don't know how to do this.

607
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
I want to show everyone I can do this, but it's really hard.

608
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Whenever I have a problem, my parents always help me out.

609
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Right now, my dad pays for everything that I want.

610
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,940
My boyfriend looks after me, especially on nights out.

611
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,940
They see me as their baby that they still need to protect.

612
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I don't do anything by myself, and I want to be more independent.

613
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
I want to do something for myself

614
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,940
and just be able to be like, yes, I did that.

615
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,940
The worst part is I'm starting to think that my parents were right.

616
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
I shouldn't have done this.

617
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Back in the jungle, Forrester's daughter, Fi,

618
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,940
has taken over leadership of the trek back to camp.

619
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,940
But it's only taken half an hour for the mood to disintegrate.

620
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,940
We really strongly think we need to go right here.

621
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
I've got to say, I do agree.

622
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Oh, brilliant.

623
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
We have been travelling in the past,

624
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,940
we have been travelling in this direction.

625
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
No, we haven't.

626
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
We've been travelling in that direction.

627
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
No.

628
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
Yeah.

629
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
No.

630
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Why is it you're so adamant you're right all the time?

631
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Just hold on.

632
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm not adamant I'm right all the time.

633
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,940
Yes, you are, because you're dismissing everybody else.

634
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
Listen, I understand.

635
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
Fi will not listen.

636
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Jeez, I live in the woods, so I always circumnavigate woods.

637
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Well done.

638
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,940
But we spent the night last night in a place that we had just left.

639
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
You never noticed... That was my fault.

640
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
..that we'd double back on us.

641
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
That was my fault.

642
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
We never noticed we'd double back.

643
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Because she wasn't in charge.

644
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,940
It's often when stress levels are high that all the social graces fall away,

645
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
and it's also when tempers fray.

646
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,940
They've got to learn quickly how to communicate better as a team.

647
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,940
At this point, their survival and that of the women at camp depends on it.

648
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
We have to spend another night in this jungle like this.

649
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
I'm out of here.

650
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
You need to listen to people.

651
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
You don't listen to anybody.

652
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,940
I do think that you really don't listen to anybody.

653
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,940
And this is actually... Is this life or death?

654
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,940
I'm just so tempted to tell you to take the lead and do it.

655
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Yeah, cos then if I leave, it's my own fault, because I'd have got us lost.

656
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
And give up.

657
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
OK, I have the machete.

658
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Oh, my God! What?

659
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Help! Becky!

660
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Becky!

661
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm coming!

662
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Call the medics!

663
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
She's gone!

664
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Bran! Bran's fainted!

665
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,940
Radio in, medic, now!

666
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,940
She's absolutely fucking boiling.

667
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Oh, my God!

668
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,940
With Belinda, the only doctor amongst her 13 women,

669
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,940
lost with the expedition party,

670
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,940
the group at camp must radio for a safety response team to intervene.

671
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Doctor Bravo, do you copy?

672
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
We see you missing, girl.

673
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Bran, passed out.

674
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,940
They are on standby on a nearby island in case of emergency.

675
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Erm...

676
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
She's boiling. I need to get some air to her.

677
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Oh, my God!

678
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
This is way fucking beyond any fucking joke.

679
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Everyone needs off here, I swear to God.

680
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,940
It's not a programme. It's fucking ridiculous.

681
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Having gone to the rocks for air,

682
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,940
after five days with barely any food or water,

683
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Fran has taken a serious turn for the worse.

684
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,940
The safety response team arrive.

685
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
Hello, Fran.

686
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,940
We're just dealing with a flat, squirrely cause at that location.

687
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I think the problem is with Fran.

688
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
I think she's not a moaner.

689
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,940
I think she's been far iller than we knew.

690
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
We're going to put her on a stretcher,

691
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
we're going to take her on our boat,

692
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,940
and then we're going to do proper assessment

693
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
and see what needs to happen from there.

694
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,940
With the group at camp a member down

695
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,940
and the expedition party lost with dwindling water supplies,

696
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
the women's existence on the island hangs in the balance.

697
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Look at that.

698
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,940
We need a radio in, medic, now.

699
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,940
The 13 women have been split apart for two days.

700
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,940
She's collapsed. Oh, my God!

701
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
And the group at camp

702
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,940
are now a member down after Fran collapsed

703
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
and was evacuated from the island.

704
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,940
Another one gone?

705
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,940
I knew she was poorlier than we thought.

706
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
Out at sea, my safety response team

707
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,940
are assessing 24-year-old Fran.

708
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,940
It says 72 and 146.

709
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,940
I don't care how, like, dehydrated or faint I am,

710
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,940
the rest of us are exactly the same.

711
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
I shouldn't get any privileged treatment

712
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
over feeling a bit sick.

713
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I'm just really pissed off at myself.

714
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
I know I can do this.

715
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Till I faint 400 times, you're not allowed to take me off that thing.

716
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,940
After five days without anywhere near enough water,

717
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,940
Fran has succumbed to dehydration.

718
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,940
And with the expedition party still nowhere in sight,

719
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,940
the other four women are equally at risk.

720
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
What the hell?

721
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,940
There's so many people dropping off.

722
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,940
I'm just worried there's going to be more and more.

723
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Because people can't stand these conditions.

724
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,940
Fran's coming back. Fran's coming back.

725
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
Is she really?

726
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,940
Fran's body temperature and heart rate have returned to normal.

727
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
And in Dr Belinda's absence,

728
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,940
the safety response team deem her fit enough to rejoin the others.

729
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Is it like heaven, seeing us?

730
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Oh, I'm sure.

731
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm sure there's things she'd rather see than us.

732
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
I had to beg her.

733
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,940
I had to beg them to let me back on the island.

734
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
I just had to come back, though,

735
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,940
cos, like, then it would be only four girls here

736
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,940
and I couldn't leave them.

737
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I'm so glad I'm back.

738
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,940
The expedition party have been walking for two days,

739
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,940
trying to find their way back to camp.

740
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
This is where I feel we should go.

741
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,940
This looks like a pretty good path.

742
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
Having wrestled leadership of the group,

743
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,940
homesick mum of two, Kate,

744
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,940
is now guiding the women through the jungle.

745
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,940
This is going to go well.

746
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Just keep going.

747
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
This is where you want to go.

748
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
The thought of not getting there, stressing me out, you know?

749
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
We will get there.

750
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm not confident to take responsibility for this.

751
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,940
OK, well, where are we going now?

752
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Where are we going now?

753
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Just keep going straight. No more confrontational arguing.

754
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Just keep walking.

755
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,940
It's just that way. Keep going, keep going, keep going.

756
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Well, I'm losing my confidence now.

757
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
I don't want to lead.

758
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
I'm sorry, I don't want to lead this group.

759
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
I don't want to.

760
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
I'll lead it. You tell me where to go.

761
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
Or do you know what?

762
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Or you lead. What do you think?

763
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
And I'm just saying a word. No, no, no.

764
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
No, I'm not going to say another word

765
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
because I'm having a complete crisis of confidence in myself.

766
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
I'm so scared.

767
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
We're all scared.

768
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
Because you were so confident.

769
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Yeah, but that's... I know, but...

770
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
Now it's gone.

771
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
My confidence is gone.

772
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Sorry, I should just keep my mouth shut.

773
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
You lead the way, Faye, please.

774
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Fuck!

775
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,940
After over two days of waiting and now dangerously dehydrated,

776
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,940
the women at camp are finally taking their fate into their own hands.

777
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,940
They haven't found us, so we've got no alternative but to find them.

778
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,940
Because we've stayed and we've waited, I don't even know,

779
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,940
two days, three days, to be rescued.

780
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
If we don't find them,

781
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,940
I think we're going to make a raft and go to another island.

782
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,940
I just never, ever want to see this spot ever in my life again.

783
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Until now, staying put.

784
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Staying put has actually been the surest way

785
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
of allowing the others to try and find them.

786
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,940
But after days with no fire, dwindling water supplies, no food,

787
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,940
the women now need to weigh out the dangers of striking out into the unknown

788
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,940
against the risk of waiting it out with no more resources.

789
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Now we have to just go and blow our whistles madly

790
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,940
to see if anyone's hearing us, and that's what we're going to do.

791
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,940
That's the plan. Blow, blow, blow.

792
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Everybody in this group is good at blowing, yeah?

793
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Yeah?

794
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
I think we're all...

795
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
We're the reason blowers here.

796
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Yeah, girls?

797
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Yes.

798
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
Unaware of the expedition party's whereabouts,

799
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,940
the five women are searching the coastline.

800
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,940
Our journey to find the other team begins now.

801
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,940
Whoa.

802
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Are you all right, sweetheart?

803
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Yeah, sorry.

804
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Cracking on.

805
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
Good on you.

806
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Oh, it's so cold.

807
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Oh, my gosh, my knickers are getting wet.

808
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Oh, my God.

809
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
At least our fannies will feel fresher.

810
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Yeah.

811
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Having left Coconut Beach three hours ago,

812
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,940
the expedition party are completely lost

813
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,940
and their water supply is fast disappearing.

814
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,940
After homesick mum of two, Kate, quit as leader,

815
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
Georgie recognises where they are.

816
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Oh, my God.

817
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,940
I made these, Mark.

818
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,940
I knew I recognised this place.

819
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,940
The women are convinced they are finally about to find camp.

820
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,940
Do you remember you, me and Abi did a recce?

821
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
This is where we came to.

822
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
I know.

823
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
I know.

824
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
That's what I was just saying.

825
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
They're just down there.

826
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,940
I'm ecstatic just because I got the hell out of Shit Creek.

827
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Fuck, that's so fucking deep.

828
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,940
That's up to my tits, so that's swimming for Fran.

829
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,940
It feels desperate because we feel so close right now.

830
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
No!

831
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Yeah.

832
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
We haven't had a response on the signal.

833
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
I'm coming out.

834
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
Along the coast,

835
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,940
the group from camp have entered the mangrove swamps.

836
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
Are we?

837
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
OK. OK.

838
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
I can't do this.

839
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,940
I've got you. I've got you.

840
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
You can totally do this.

841
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
One, two, three.

842
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
There we go.

843
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,940
With the sweltering midday sun beating down on us,

844
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
the dehydrated women,

845
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,940
55-year-old cashier Julie is struggling.

846
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Oh, fuck.

847
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
It's all right, hold me.

848
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
Back one's in now.

849
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Left and right, left and right.

850
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
There.

851
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
That's it.

852
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
OK, so feet...

853
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
I need to leave me boots.

854
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
No, you're going to need to take those with you.

855
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
You're going to need them.

856
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,940
So we can do it.

857
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
We'll just take our time.

858
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
No rush.

859
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
We'll just take our time.

860
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Oh, friggin' hell.

861
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Oh, fuck.

862
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Oh, friggin' hell.

863
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Oh, God.

864
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Right?

865
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Yeah, thanks.

866
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
Another mark.

867
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
Look, another one.

868
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,940
Snap.

869
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Yeah, brilliant.

870
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
Yeah, this is it.

871
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
This is good.

872
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
I recognise this.

873
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
We're so damn close, though.

874
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
So close.

875
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
This does look familiar.

876
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,940
We're literally round this corner.

877
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Is that a pink potty down there?

878
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Yes.

879
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,940
So you recognise it?

880
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
We're at Coconut fucking Beach.

881
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,940
No, we're not.

882
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Yeah, we're at Coconut Beach.

883
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
We are.

884
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
You're right, we are.

885
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
What the fuck?

886
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Come on, let's get down there.

887
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
I can't fucking deal with this.

888
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,940
The women have circled back to Coconut Beach

889
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
for a second time.

890
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,940
Having pushed through the jungle for two days,

891
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,940
they're not one step closer to camp.

892
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,940
How the fuck is that possible?

893
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
How is this possible?

894
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,940
We kept the sea to our left the whole time.

895
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
After conquering the mangroves,

896
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,940
the group from camp continue north.

897
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
Guys, it's a beach!

898
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Woo!

899
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
I can't believe we're here.

900
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,940
Becky, this is what I've been dreaming of.

901
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,940
After five days being trapped in the jungle,

902
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,940
they remain determined to find the expedition party.

903
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,940
I thought we were so fucking close,

904
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,940
like, three minutes away.

905
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,940
It's only round the corner, but we can't fucking navigate.

906
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,940
We cannot navigate through that.

907
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,940
I'm stressed because I thought we were so close.

908
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,940
And then I can't walk and I'm just fucked

909
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
and we're all fucked.

910
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
It sucks.

911
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,940
Three nights without water,

912
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
fucking trousers like this.

913
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
I can't do it. No way.

914
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,940
I was wanting to see them and see if they were OK.

915
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,940
How the fuck did that happen?

916
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,940
I don't even understand.

917
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,940
We cannot walk anywhere on this island

918
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
and we're getting lost.

919
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
It's a maze.

920
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,940
It's the world's trickiest maze.

921
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,940
Shall we have a 30-second shade break?

922
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
No.

923
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I need to go and see.

924
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
OK.

925
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Another beach, but not as nice as the one we're on.

926
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Hang on.

927
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,940
Is that a load of clothes hanging in that tree?

928
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
Hello!

929
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,940
What? I can hear someone.

930
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,940
I'll be back to pick you up.

931
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:19,280
This is the 35thвер fact of all the

932
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Yeah.

933
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,940
I think I've got to pick it up.

934
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
Oh!

935
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
Woo!

936
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Woo!

937
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:49,440
How ever bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity, you know, survival is

938
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,500
about dogged determination, learning from your failures and never giving up.

939
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:18,100
Finally, back together, the women take a moment to savour their island home.

940
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,280
We needed them, we've all got different strengths and weaknesses that help, it's just kind of

941
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
complete.

942
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:43,020
By evening, with the reunited group, 13 women strong, it's all hands on deck to light a

943
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,600
new fire.

944
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:52,060
But after being lost for two days, island survival has taken its toll on mum of two,

945
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,060
Kate.

946
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,060
It's just a dream.

947
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,060
It's just the whole end.

948
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,060
The blunt end.

949
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,060
If I'm really honest with you, I can't see it getting any better.

950
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,060
I feel really tired and very, very emotional.

951
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:12,060
To try and be a part of this group, but they're not the people I need to be with.

952
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:18,720
I need to be with my family.

953
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,820
And I just need to be at home.

954
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,060
The general feeling is, I'm not going to be home.

955
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,060
I'm going to be home.

956
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,060
I'm going to be home.

957
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,060
Take me home, please.

958
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Take me home, please.

959
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,060
By morning, furniture maker Kate has made her decision.

960
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,060
I'm not going home because I'm dehydrated.

961
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,060
I'm not going home because I can't pack it.

962
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,060
I'm going home because I want to be at home.

963
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
You contribute so much.

964
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,060
You really do.

965
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,060
But it's been difficult for me because I've been missing people so much.

966
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:52,060
That won't be possible with any help.

967
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,260
You've been missing people so much. That won't get any easier.

968
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,660
That'll get worse.

969
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,460
Oh, my God, it's horrible seeing another one go.

970
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,220
I thought she'd hang on in there.

971
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,660
We need everybody, and she had good knowledge

972
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,900
of bloody building and stuff.

973
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,460
Mum was fucking pissed off.

974
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,620
I just think it's weak of her to do that.

975
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,540
She's giving up too easily.

976
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,900
We need each other to boost each other up.

977
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
But it's the old thing, isn't it?

978
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,580
Kids, mum and her kids.

979
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,020
It's the old pull.

980
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,300
Men can do it, but a lot of women can't.

981
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,380
After barely a week on the island,

982
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,820
a second member of the team has quit.

983
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,420
And with power in numbers,

984
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,540
the women's ability to survive is diminishing.

985
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,820
I'm a bit pissed off.

986
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,060
I think it's a great shame,

987
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,860
because the hit was a great one.

988
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,980
It was a fantastic experiment to see how 14 women could cope

989
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,580
in this situation.

990
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,820
And two of them have gone already,

991
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,420
and I don't think that shows us all in particularly good light.

992
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,060
Next time on the island...

993
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,020
Sometimes out here can feel like you've been hit

994
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,100
by a major disaster.

995
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,780
So thin now.

996
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,660
All sorts of bones appearing

997
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,220
that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.

998
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,140
We need to find a solid source of food

999
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,940
or we could be facing meltdown.

1000
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,300
Every fucker's bitching and moaning

1001
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
that you're doing fuck all when it comes to water.

1002
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,380
I'd say we're 95% sure we've got a caiman in our second trap.

1003
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,540
Holy fuck.

1004
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,340
Come on, baby.

1005
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,620
Sam, get out of the water, mate.

1006
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,180
Watch him, watch him. Go now, go now.

1007
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,220
