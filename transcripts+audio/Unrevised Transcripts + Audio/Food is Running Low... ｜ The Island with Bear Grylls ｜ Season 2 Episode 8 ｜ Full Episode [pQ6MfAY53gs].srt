1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:22,960
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:33,700
utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,460
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance hello you can see Pierce's heart beating

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:51,580
through the rib will it be brute power or mental strength the Windsor day who will have what it

6
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,900
takes to stay alive

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:05,080
tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than ever they'll have to find

8
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,720
water and hunt for their own food that is the biggest shocker I've ever seen living on the

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:20,820
island in the middle of tropical storm season we expected to survive it when pitted against

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,580
the extremes of nature

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,000
and these Monday women got what it takes to survive guys come back here really slowly

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:50,800
it's been almost three weeks since I dropped 14 women off on this remote Pacific Island radio in

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
now medic now

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,280
they're three people down I thought she'd hang on in there and with fewer women to hunt and food running

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,720
dangerously low surely I'm gonna die soon spa owner Abby one of the oldest of the women has kept the

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:15,400
group together she encouraged the others to make a difficult but necessary survival choice to eat

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,500
their pet pigs I don't know about anyone else but I feel like a wild animal

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:41,960
what's your assessment of the situation hairdresser there's a vocabulary for hairdressers so as not to offend the client so I'm always subtle in my work so I'd say it's f***ing had it

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,820
after weeks on the island stripped of all luxuries Abby is improvising in her island salon with a novel blue rinse it's probably permanent boat paint or something

20
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,960
it's probably permanent boat paint or something

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,960
basins are over there the junior will see to it

22
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,960
quite happy now I've done a bit of hairdressing

23
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,960
oh look at the colour of the sea that's what we want to swim in

24
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:19,960
in a group like this when you're really starving and struggling all you need is that one person to kind of shine a little beacon of light and say something really witty and funny

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
and Abby is that person

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
it's 95 pound please

27
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
the oven's broken

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
thanks chef

29
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
oh my god

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,960
it's been days since women ate the piglets and they haven't had a decent meal since

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,960
can I have it with sand please I don't think I've got enough sand in my mouth

32
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
they're back to eating scraps of foraged coconut and yucca

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
and starvation isn't fair

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
and their wife is far away

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
did you notice it was on fire

36
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
oh wow

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:06,960
you're getting a really burnt one

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
with some eating as little as a dangerously low 200 calories a day

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,960
any stores they started off with are basically gone

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,960
so the women need to go all out to increase their food intake and their lives are going to depend on that

41
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
I'm psyched like you did

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
spit that out

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
it's too burnt

44
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,760
that's disgusting i was saying a couple of days ago in jest that i feel like my body's

45
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:37,000
digesting itself but i just know more i am eating myself from the inside i'm just hoping that we can

46
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,680
get some food do you know what my favorite thing to do at the minute is i go to the imaginary

47
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,560
supermarket in my head with a shopping trolley empty and go up and down the aisles and do

48
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,640
shopping i spent about 10 minutes in the jam and condiments section yesterday did you what did you

49
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,840
get well i mean i went to the i bought marmalade i got shredded and smooth in the edge because i

50
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,520
didn't know what to do and i was going along because i'd obviously bought the imaginary pate

51
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,960
so that i needed to debate which imaginary condiment would go best and then i got to

52
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,520
the bakery and i didn't know whether i wanted crusty bread or soft bread this is the mind of

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,240
a lunatic in terms of survival skills i think i'm quite mentally strong

54
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,480
and i'm not a person who's just going to go around doing a lot of stuff but i'm not a person who's

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,520
going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,540
i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to

57
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,620
I don't think there's much that will rattle me,

58
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,780
but then I've never really been pushed to my limits before.

59
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,500
The biggest challenge is being able to go for a long period

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,460
without a good dinner in my belly.

61
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,900
I don't think myself as a natural hunter-gatherer,

62
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,300
but in 34 years, nothing's got between me and Emil yet.

63
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,660
So if there's food on that island, I'll find it.

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,540
Unable to digest yucca,

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,900
the women's breakfast is not agreeing with Georgina.

66
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,580
I've been sick again. I can't stop.

67
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,900
Oh, my God!

68
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,500
I don't know what I'm... There's nothing to suck up, though.

69
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,300
Are you drinking enough?

70
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,900
Yeah, I've just tried to drink a little more.

71
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm driving you mad.

72
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,980
Camp doctor Belinda is concerned about Georgina's condition.

73
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,340
George literally exists on a couple of limpets a day

74
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,180
and maybe a couple of snails.

75
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,020
She does not eat more than about that much tiny square of coconut a day,

76
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,620
so she's probably consuming

77
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,700
under 20 calories per day.

78
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,940
And it's just not sustainable.

79
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,260
Georgina's inability to digest their limited diet

80
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,340
means she could be putting her vital organs at risk.

81
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,980
You had some recting, yeah?

82
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,220
Yeah, well, this is one of the major reasons

83
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,420
why I'm worried about your kidneys.

84
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,340
So we'll just get your temperature.

85
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,420
I mean, I can literally feel my muscles within my body.

86
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,740
They're really wasting away.

87
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,100
Er, and I just heard that was messed up at one of them.

88
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,180
I just need to get some food. Just something.

89
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,980
Because if I don't, then it could be endgame for me, really,

90
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,740
with regards to being on the island.

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,420
Off we go.

92
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,420
Everyone is now pitching in to try and find protein that they can share

93
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,100
with Georgina.

94
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,020
A group led by Abi are scouring the shoreline.

95
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,180
They're very hard to get off.

96
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,100
Look at the size of that monster.

97
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,540
Can I have a try? You can.

98
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,180
Just have a try at just banging it.

99
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,540
Do you say that to your boyfriend?

100
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,860
Yeah!

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Limp it.

102
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,300
So you've got the cool, the warms and the natural,

103
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,700
so that's got to slight.

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,260
It's got a lilac-y tinge in it, but it's nice.

105
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,780
I run my own business.

106
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,460
Sales for last month is really, really good.

107
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,780
I like being in charge of people and a team.

108
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,860
I'll work at something till I am successful at it.

109
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
I have a bad back.

110
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,740
It causes me quite a lot of problems and quite a lot of pain.

111
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,420
I get through it and I don't let it stop me doing anything at the moor.

112
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll snow ski, I'll ride, I'll push myself.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Good lad.

114
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,820
First day we came up... Yeah. ..they were like,

115
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Yeah.

116
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,180
..on that back wall.

117
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,860
There's just no bloody limpets.

118
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,140
It's like we've eaten them all.

119
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,180
It's warm down there.

120
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,660
Yeah, well, I'm not going down there to get down there.

121
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
It's not where you've been for a while.

122
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,180
I'm not risking my life to get a frigging limpet.

123
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,340
No chance.

124
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,940
With limpets few and far between,

125
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,980
the women desperately need to find a protein-rich meal for Georgina.

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,020
Get the knife! Get the knife!

127
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
What is that? Get the machete!

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,020
Where's the machete?

129
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,020
Just get the fucking machete.

130
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Georgia spotted a stingray in the shallows.

131
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Wow! It's fast!

132
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Oh, no chance.

133
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
How fast did that move?

134
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
That was like lightning fast.

135
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Where did the bottles go?

136
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
The miss has cost them a potential 4,000-calorie meal.

137
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,820
We would have had a proper belly food, you know, proper belly food.

138
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,820
As opposed to this much dried coconut every day.

139
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Georgina must once again go to bed hungry.

140
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
But she's not the only one who's suffering.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,820
I've got pants as my pillow and smelly socks.

142
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
47-year-old Abi has been diagnosed

143
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
with back pain since a horse-riding accident in her teens.

144
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Oh, God.

145
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Abi's not happy. She's in pain.

146
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
So, I hope she's OK.

147
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Since arriving on the island, she's been sleeping on the hard ground.

148
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
I have nowhere comfortable I can go.

149
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Honestly, it's laying down on the floor.

150
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I think my back's absolutely screwed.

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
It's really hard to explain,

152
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
because it's not something you can see.

153
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And it is my health,

154
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
and it's not something that anyone can help me with.

155
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I don't want to be a liability to anyone else

156
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
and not be able to do the things that I came to do,

157
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
which was to help and be a grafter.

158
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
So, I've got the scales here.

159
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I've calibrated them and set the dial to zero.

160
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
But it's all the women's health that's a concern for Dr Belinda.

161
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,820
After noticing the steep decline in Georgina's physical condition,

162
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
she wants to closely monitor the group's weight loss.

163
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Abi!

164
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I used to go to Slimming Club, right, every Monday.

165
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
I feel like I'm back there.

166
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,820
If I am ten and a half stone today, I'll be a happy bunny.

167
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,820
£135.

168
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Got my goal.

169
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,820
In 21st-century Britain, we're all obsessed with body image.

170
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
But when the pounds are dropping off

171
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
because of starvation and malnutrition,

172
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
it's a dangerous mindset to have,

173
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,820
and it really is not a cause for celebration.

174
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
But you can see your waist is tiny-ton round.

175
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Let me see your tiny little waist.

176
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Aw, look at that little waist.

177
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
SHE LAUGHS

178
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
George.

179
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
You've lost a lot.

180
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
You're wasting away, aren't you, sweetheart?

181
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
I have to say, I don't find starvation a good way of losing weight.

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
I don't think we should be celebrating.

183
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny.

184
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Georgina has lost a dangerous £21 in weight,

185
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
and collectively, the group have lost almost ten stone,

186
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
the weight of an entire person.

187
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,820
We're at a critical stage where our bodies have got no food...

188
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
..and so can't sustain themselves.

189
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
We're not on a diet.

190
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
We're starving.

191
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Concerned about their dramatic weight loss,

192
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Georgina calls a group together.

193
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
I do feel like I may have nosedived

194
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
in terms of food deprivation a lot quicker than the rest of you.

195
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I can see that I've been a lot weaker than the rest of you.

196
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,820
And I really do think that food still needs to be number one priority.

197
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
I just don't know how long we can sustain five limpets.

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I don't think we can.

199
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I think we're all a little bit in denial

200
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
about how critical it is that we start finding food.

201
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
The need to find protein for Georgina is now urgent.

202
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
With only a few hours of daylight left,

203
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
a group led by Lauren are setting traps.

204
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
And the hope is snaring a pig.

205
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Nice little track, isn't it?

206
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Unless you're wanting to survive off shredded old pits of coconut

207
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
and the old yucca plant,

208
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
then it's time to face up to the fact

209
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,820
that I'm going to have to maybe, you know, get a bit brutal.

210
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Are you ready?

211
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Yeah, it works.

212
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Yeah.

213
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Rise and shine, beautiful.

214
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
It's a glorious day.

215
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
7am.

216
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
And the women have endured another bad night's sleep.

217
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
Oh, bloody hell.

218
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,820
In pain, 47-year-old Abi confides in her closest friend, Beth.

219
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Every night when I said, this is the time I dread,

220
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
I'm so uncomfortable.

221
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Even just turning from my back to my right

222
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
is like a knife going into the nerve.

223
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
It's like, argh!

224
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I'm now really concerned.

225
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
She hasn't really moaned.

226
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
One of Abi's problems is that she's worried

227
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
that she doesn't like giving up.

228
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
She likes to keep going and keep going.

229
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
She's such a hard worker.

230
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
She's just fucking amazing.

231
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Let's see what's in this sucker.

232
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
She's a proper, proper grafter.

233
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And I love that.

234
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
But her mind is saying one thing and her body's saying something else

235
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
and she's got to listen to her body.

236
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
At camp, Abi calls an urgent meeting.

237
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Over the last few days, my back's gone downhill massively

238
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
to the point where I'm in a lot of pain

239
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
and it's now worse than it's ever been.

240
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I know certain people here,

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
kind of said, do less.

242
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be happy doing less.

243
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
But the fact is, I have to get off the island

244
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
because I'm not helpful to you anymore.

245
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm really sorry and I feel like a shit.

246
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I can't... I actually can't believe it.

247
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
I'm just completely shocked.

248
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
I knew that she was in pain, I knew that she was having back pain,

249
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
but it's just happened so fast.

250
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
I'm really gutted to see you go

251
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
because I think we could have done really well here with you

252
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
and I think we'd be a little bit weaker without you.

253
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me now

254
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,820
that is completely terrified because there is only ten of us.

255
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Because everything now is going to be completely harder.

256
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
And I can't imagine how we're going to get through

257
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
and we're going to feed ourselves.

258
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I think hunger's going to become such a problem.

259
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
And me pussy mate.

260
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I don't know what I'm going to do.

261
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
So sad.

262
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,820
I'm annoyed for her that she had to go because of her back.

263
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,820
And I'm annoyed for me that I'm going to have to stay out here.

264
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
But we just got on really well

265
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
and it was just really nice to know that she was there.

266
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Bye.

267
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I miss you already, come back!

268
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
I don't know about you, but I feel thoroughly fed up.

269
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Yeah.

270
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
I feel as a group, get smaller and smaller,

271
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
you're like, how are we meant to do this?

272
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Exactly.

273
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
How on earth are we meant to do this?

274
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Exactly.

275
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Yeah, it's shit.

276
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
It's really shit.

277
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
The group has lost Abi, one of their most valued members.

278
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Now they'll each have to work

279
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
even harder to find food for 34-year-old Georgina,

280
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
who is dangerously weak from starvation.

281
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
How do I have the patience for that, Lauren?

282
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Neither do I, really, but...

283
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I really want to eat something.

284
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
The women haven't caught a single fish

285
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
since they first stepped foot on the island.

286
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
They're attempting to set nets for the first time.

287
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
I'm literally solely focused on getting through the days

288
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
and getting food.

289
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
And I'm going to go after it, and I'm going to get it.

290
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
And I'm going to get it for the other girls as well, you know?

291
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I feel sorry for George,

292
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
because he's just been absolutely nailed by illness,

293
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
and so failure is not an option.

294
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Whoa!

295
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
That's not even stable at all.

296
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Hello!

297
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
On a desert island, one of your best sources of food

298
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
is obviously going to come from the sea,

299
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
but none of the women are able to do that.

300
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
None of the women are experienced at sea fishing,

301
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
so the reality is it's going to take them hours and hours

302
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
of painstaking trial and error,

303
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
being patient if they're going to hone their skills.

304
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,820
It's as sturdy as we're going to get it.

305
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Who knows? Could be fish tonight.

306
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,820
It's now 12 hours since Lauren and the group set the nets.

307
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm hoping that we've got about ten fish in our net.

308
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Come on, net. Do us good. Do us good.

309
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Their last hope of feeding Georgina tonight

310
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
rests on a decent haul.

311
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
There's one of our floats.

312
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Is the net here? Is it?

313
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Is there a fish in it? No.

314
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Ah! Bastard.

315
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
That's such a shame.

316
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I don't know if we'll ever be able to untangle that net.

317
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
No, we're not.

318
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
How the fuck are we going to catch fish?

319
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
I feel pathetic today. No.

320
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Honestly, I haven't been able to function at all today.

321
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,820
With no fish and Georgina's health hanging in the balance,

322
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
it's a race against time to find food.

323
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
To make sure these women have a fighting chance of survival,

324
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I've made sure that the island's got enough water,

325
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive,

326
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,820
but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it.

327
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Fingers crossed.

328
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Yesterday, Lauren and Beth set animal traps

329
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
in the island's jungle interior.

330
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
They're going back to see if they've been successful.

331
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Something has eaten the bait but not set off the trap.

332
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
Got the knife.

333
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
It's not a game and it's a long time without food

334
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
and we can't survive without food.

335
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,820
I think it's about time that, you know,

336
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,820
we get out there and start hunting some animals.

337
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,820
One of my main things that's pushing me for this challenge

338
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
is finding out who I am.

339
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Can I survive? Can I hunt for my own food?

340
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
We don't do that nowadays.

341
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Super cheesy lasagne.

342
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Cheesy dip.

343
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Johnson cheesy dip.

344
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Just think it's getting back to our animalistic roots

345
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
and what happens if you have to go hunting for it,

346
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,820
kill it yourself, skin it or whatever, and then cook it.

347
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
It's been set off.

348
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
It has.

349
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

350
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
They've caught a pig by its leg in one of their traps.

351
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Fuck!

352
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
That is one huge pig.

353
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
I can't believe that.

354
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Before killing it, Lauren and Beth decide to return to camp

355
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
to plan and prepare their tools.

356
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Oh, my God, we're going to eat tonight. I know.

357
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Like we've never eaten before.

358
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Yay!

359
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Georgie, we've caught one.

360
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
We've caught a pig.

361
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
You are kidding me. No.

362
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Because there's a pig in the trap.

363
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
We literally walked in and heard this noise.

364
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
It's right there. Yeah.

365
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Oh, my God.

367
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Oh, my God.

368
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Everybody needs that food,

369
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,820
but I recognise that I really need that food.

370
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
It's a little bit of a mental feeling.

371
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,820
And who knew that a pig in a snare would...

372
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,820
..would feel like such an emotional thing?

373
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,820
We're just going to have to absolutely throw our bodies at it.

374
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Don't look at it in the eye.

375
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Don't have your eyes wide and looking at it,

376
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
so don't show any of your teeth.

377
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Approach it really quietly. OK.

378
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
And so, once we've got it on the ground,

379
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
you need to tie its hooves together

380
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
and we're also letting loose its neck,

381
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
so someone will have to be pulling on its neck.

382
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Does anyone else want to kill the pig?

383
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
I don't feel confident that I could.

384
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I don't know enough.

385
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,820
If you need help at any stage, I'm more than happy to help.

386
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Yeah. OK.

387
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
At the minute, I'm the only one in the house

388
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
at the minute, I'm the only one in the group

389
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
that could actually physically kill an animal

390
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
because no-one else wants to do it.

391
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,820
And so I feel that's a responsibility as well.

392
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I don't see them as an animal any more,

393
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
which is so strange for me.

394
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
I love animals to pieces,

395
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,820
but I just feel completely detached from that now.

396
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
It's been over an hour

397
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,820
since Lauren and Beth found the pig in the trap.

398
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
A decisive kill is in store.

399
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820
It is now crucial to the whole group.

400
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
I'm going to go for the head.

401
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Then I'm going to go for the legs.

402
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
I'm ready to go.

403
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
So come in with your hooves,

404
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
and I'm going to go with the side of the leg.

405
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
So you've got it.

406
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
Get in.

407
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Someone grab this.

408
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Come round this side.

409
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Beth, come round this side.

410
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
The trap.

411
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
OK, right.

412
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Make some moves.

413
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Hang on.

414
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Right.

415
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
OK, Beth.

416
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Step.

417
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Beth.

418
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
Try and...

419
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Fuck.

420
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Fuck's sake.

421
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,820
That's...

422
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
That's so frustrating.

423
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
We lived and learned on that one.

424
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,820
I think that you need to get on him quicker.

425
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I feel like I fucked that one up.

426
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Damn it.

427
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Damn it.

428
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Could have bloody...

429
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
And now I feel like we've let down everybody else.

430
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,820
You know, the ones waiting at camp, thinking,

431
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
oh, they've got a pig and they're eating tonight.

432
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
And George isn't very well.

433
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
She's being sick.

434
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
So...

435
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Yeah.

436
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Nice.

437
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Good.

438
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Good.

439
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
All right.

440
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
How much we got?

441
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Not enough.

442
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Could do with a bit more of everything.

443
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Maybe around the next bit.

444
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
But I think we've exhausted this little section.

445
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:47,820
With the hunter failure, Georgina has no choice but to join Georgie and Becky on another

446
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
bleak search for shellfish.

447
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
It's so hot, isn't it?

448
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
Yeah.

449
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
It's really humid.

450
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
Really hot.

451
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,820
Already weak from malnutrition, the effort is further depleting Georgina's dainties.

452
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Yeah.

453
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
We've got a little bit of everything.

454
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
There's some more.

455
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,820
creating Georgina's dangerously low reserves.

456
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,820
The function of my being is struggling.

457
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,820
I feel like the switch has been turned off every time I stand up.

458
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
I don't know what to do about it, either.

459
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,820
It's like a vicious circle. You need the energy to get the food.

460
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,820
But you haven't got the energy without the food.

461
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,820
I honestly don't know where these girls are getting their energy from.

462
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
Swim time! It certainly is.

463
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Let's go for a swim, babe. Yeah.

464
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I'm just really worried about how weak I am.

465
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,820
I just don't want to be the person who's, like, a dead weight.

466
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
You're not going to be. And you're not going to be.

467
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,820
But I feel like I am. It's just so not like me.

468
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,820
I don't know if I'm going to be the person I want to be.

469
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
Honestly, it's like the lights have gone off,

470
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
and it's really...

471
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
..it's really quite alarming.

472
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,820
Listen, you are not... Thank you.

473
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Listen, you are not leaving this island, right?

474
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,820
For one, listen to me. But I do.

475
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,820
Listen, you are not leaving this island to the fucking end game, right?

476
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,820
I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back, and nor does she.

477
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,820
And you would. And I would. Totally. And I would.

478
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
I would.

479
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,820
I'm really, really worried about Georgia Kay.

480
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,820
Literally, I'm watching her deteriorate before my eyes.

481
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,820
She's not eating the yucca, she's not very keen on the limpets,

482
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,820
and I'm just really worried she's not going to make it, to be honest.

483
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,820
The one thing we need for George is food.

484
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,820
Who knows? Maybe we can get one more island miracle

485
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,820
and turn George's fate around, which would be amazing.

486
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,820
So far, all the women's attempts

487
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,820
at hunting and fishing on the island have failed.

488
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Oh, look! Like pot noodle. Yeah.

489
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,820
Desperately hungry, they've resorted to scavenging

490
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
for nourishment on the beach.

491
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Budweiser!

492
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Full of sea water.

493
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
What's that? Some perfume.

494
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Men's perfume. It's like that.

495
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Oh, now I'm getting horny!

496
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Oh, first time I've thought about a man.

497
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Jamie could hump this smell.

498
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Maybe if you wear that, I might start humping you. Oh, gosh.

499
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,820
The women have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet for weeks,

500
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,820
and the health of one of the group is causing grave concern.

501
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,820
I'm really worried about George.

502
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,820
She sleeps all the time, she's been sick.

503
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,820
She's just not well.

504
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I don't know whether she's going to last.

505
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Who are we going to talk about food with?

506
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,820
We can't afford to lose anyone else in this group.

507
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,820
One rich source of food on the island is its bird life.

508
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Catching one of the island's larger birds could mean 2,000 calories

509
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
to share with Georgina.

510
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Now, I have no idea if this will work.

511
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
We can only try.

512
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Psychotherapist Havilah has fashioned a bird trap

513
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,820
out of a stick, some string and a coconut.

514
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm going to put my trap in here.

515
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,820
This is quite good territory.

516
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Birds are often flocking here.

517
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,820
We don't want to get nice, pretty birds.

518
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,820
But to lure her prey, she's going to need bait.

519
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Oh, there's a hermit crab.

520
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,820
I don't want to do this.

521
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,820
Not very good at machetes.

522
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Hello, beautiful.

523
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Go on, go to Daddy.

524
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
One, two, three.

525
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,820
My dad has been a pigeon racer from a young age,

526
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,820
so I understand birds.

527
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,820
I know how to handle them, I know what to do.

528
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820
And if it comes to it...

529
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
I'll kill one.

530
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
No, no, no, no, no.

531
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I wouldn't take any pleasure from it.

532
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
I don't really want to kill anything,

533
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
but I could if I'm hungry.

534
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,820
In those situations, what needs to be done needs to be done.

535
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
Yeah, I've done it, so I've killed it.

536
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,820
Havilah will need to return in the morning.

537
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,820
So dinner tonight will be once again a handful of limpets...

538
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
..at around seven calories a pop.

539
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,820
So I think we've got five each, I think.

540
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,820
I don't know if you want to count them up.

541
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Whoa!

542
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Wow!

543
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Pop that in your mouth.

544
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Thank you, big horse.

545
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
Well done.

546
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
It's like a lollipop, I can't believe it.

547
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,820
I know what it's like, and it's not a lollipop.

548
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
From here, it looks like a bellend.

549
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Oh!

550
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
This tastes like her boyfriend's ball.

551
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,820
How I would imagine testicles taste.

552
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,820
And those limpets, bloody hell, oh, my God.

553
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
It reminded me of...

554
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,820
..if I was to put my boyfriend's testicle in my mouth

555
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
and take a bite...

556
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
..like, a rubbery consistency

557
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,820
and then a pop of, like, juice and goo,

558
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,820
and, oh, my God, I now can't get that image out of my head.

559
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
It makes me get thinking about it.

560
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
By the way, she's never teabagged him.

561
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,820
What does teabagging mean?

562
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Who's going to explain that one?

563
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Put the testicles in your mouth.

564
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,820
Why?

565
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Why not?

566
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
Oh, Gillian, you dirty bitch.

567
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Classy.

568
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
WHISTLE BLOWS

569
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
WHISTLE BLOWS

570
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
WHISTLE BLOWS

571
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Another day, and once again, no breakfast.

572
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Who'd like some pancakes and bacon?

573
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh, damn.

574
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Pancakes, bacon, maple syrup...

575
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,820
..stack.

576
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,820
George, can I get you anything?

577
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,820
Ravaged by hunger, Georgina is too frail to leave camp.

578
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
I'm absolutely floored

579
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,820
by what I can only presume is malnutrition.

580
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
I don't want to be the one who's ill or sickly

581
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,820
because I'm not that person at home.

582
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,820
There's enough people who need feeding and drinking

583
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
without just having a dead weight to carry.

584
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
OK, so...

585
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
..not nice, but if there is a birdie there,

586
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,820
you need to take a knife.

587
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,820
Havilah's bird tracking team

588
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
is now looking for the birdie.

589
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
They're looking for the birdie.

590
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,820
They're looking for the birdie.

591
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,820
They're looking for the birdie.

592
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Havilah's bird trap, if successful,

593
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
could provide a much-needed meal.

594
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Have you killed birds before age?

595
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Yeah, but I don't like doing it.

596
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
It kind of was enforced on me as a child.

597
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
Insects have eaten my bait.

598
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Trial and error, Georgie, trial and error.

599
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
But I need to go away and rethink it.

600
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,820
I think we are actually starving, you know?

601
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,820
You never sit at home and think,

602
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,820
oh, I'll just have one limb pit today,

603
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
or I won't eat today.

604
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
I'll eat in three weeks.

605
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
It just doesn't happen.

606
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,820
With Havilah's bird trap a failure,

607
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,820
there's no choice but to venture back into the jungle.

608
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,820
We're going to set some pig traps

609
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,820
so we can get some pigs.

610
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
What's your favourite type of pork?

611
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,820
I think it's got to be pulled pork, but done right.

612
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Having come so close to making a kill 24 hours ago,

613
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Laura and Beth and Belinda are back on the trail of the pig.

614
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Let's try and find some tracks and trap it up.

615
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,820
It could be their only hope of keeping Georgina on the island.

616
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,820
Here's the dead-eaten crab, isn't it?

617
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Mm-hm.

618
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,820
It's been here snuffling.

619
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Stop on that branch right in front of you, darling.

620
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
There's a massive bird.

621
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,820
There's a massive boa.

622
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
See this branch here?

623
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Look, at the top.

624
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
Wow.

625
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Shall we try and catch it?

626
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Yes.

627
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
I'm happy to go for him.

628
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,820
The boa constrictor snake is a formidable foe.

629
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,820
This guy will kill its prey by biting, grabbing,

630
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,820
then rapping and suffocating,

631
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
and then will swallow it whole.

632
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,820
They're very fast, they can strike half their body length,

633
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,820
and you do not want to get hurt.

634
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,820
You want to get a snake bite in a survival situation.

635
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
You see him?

636
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,820
I think he's gone, actually, inside, going down,

637
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,820
so he's probably going to come out in a minute.

638
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,820
Well, he's out. He's coming down!

639
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,820
He's out.

640
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,820
OK, now he's in striking mode.

641
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,820
The way to kill it is to pin its head.

642
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,820
If you control the head, you control the body,

643
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,820
and then either stave its head in with a rock

644
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
or cut its head off with a machete.

645
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
But if you can catch them,

646
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,820
this is great survival food.

647
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,820
Look at all the meat on this guy.

648
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Whoa!

649
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Right, there we go. There's your...

650
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Well done, Bish. Got him.

651
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
Well done, well done, well done.

652
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
I didn't get him.

653
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
I didn't get him, I didn't get him.

654
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Oh, she didn't, she didn't.

655
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Man, you can even just do a machete on him.

656
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
Hold.

657
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
No.

658
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
Hold.

659
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
Good, good one, good one.

660
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
Well done, well done, well done.

661
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,820
OK, well done, guys. Well done, well done.

662
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
High five!

663
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
Yeah!

664
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,820
We seized the opportunity and just went and did it.

665
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,820
Oh, wow. Sorry, Mr Snake.

666
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Snake starters followed by limpets and snails.

667
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
This is really going to lift the spirits on camp,

668
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,820
which is great.

669
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Let's go home.

670
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
I wonder when on our jungle trekking days

671
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,820
how many things we went past without knowing.

672
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Guys?

673
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Yeah?

674
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Guys?

675
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Come back here really fucking slowly.

676
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Where are you?

677
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Shh!

678
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Don't shout.

679
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,820
There, there, there, there, there.

680
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
There.

681
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
You see it?

682
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Oh, yeah.

683
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
A pig.

684
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,820
Fucking hell.

685
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Is it dead?

686
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
It's not dead.

687
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,820
It's just closed its eyes.

688
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
Here's the thing.

689
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,820
Do we jump it now?

690
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
Yep.

691
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,820
I don't know.

692
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,820
It seems like too much of a gift from the gods.

693
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm not going to do it.

694
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
He's right here.

695
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Basically, it's me.

696
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm going to go for the head.

697
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,820
I'm going to go for the trunk.

698
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Right now, I'm trying to get the noose around his neck.

699
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,820
They're going to come in straight out

700
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,820
and tie his face together.

701
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,820
If they need it, smack with a rock in front of them.

702
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
We can't always stay in.

703
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,820
We don't have the fucking game room.

704
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,820
We're strong.

705
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
We're big.

706
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,820
We're clean.

707
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,820
We're good.

708
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm not going to think about it.

709
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Yeah, of course.

710
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Yeah.

711
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:19,820
We can't always stay in.

712
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
We don't have the fucking game room.

713
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
A hunting party led by Lauren

714
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
has stumbled across a sleeping pig

715
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,820
in the middle of the jungle.

716
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
It could offer salvation for Georgina,

717
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
who's desperately malnourished.

718
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
The law of the jungle

719
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,820
really is rooted in opportunity,

720
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
and you've got to take your chances when you can.

721
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,820
The women need to learn from passing decisions.

722
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Just seize the moment.

723
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
The stakes are high.

724
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
If they fail,

725
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,820
the group are going to slide further into starvation.

726
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
Are we committed?

727
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
Yeah.

728
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
100%?

729
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Yeah.

730
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
100%?

731
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Yeah.

732
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
OK.

733
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
This time, they're prepared

734
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,820
and have sharp weapons for the kill.

735
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
OK.

736
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
Let's go.

737
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
Let's go.

738
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Let's go.

739
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Let's go.

740
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
Let's go.

741
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Let's go.

742
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
All right.

743
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
OK.

744
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
All right.

745
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
All right.

746
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
All right.

747
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
OK.

748
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Wait a minute.

749
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I've got to get my hand to the door.

750
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
OK.

751
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
All right.

752
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
OK.

753
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Wait.

754
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Let's go.

755
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Yeah.

756
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
What are we going to do?

757
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Let's go.

758
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
We're going to take your chance.

759
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
OK.

760
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Whatever.

761
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
All right.

762
00:38:34,820 --> 00:39:04,220
Okay, everyone? Everyone okay?

763
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. You okay, Beth?

764
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Yeah.

765
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,220
Okay, I'm just gonna put the knife to the side, out of the way.

766
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,220
And we'll just wait. We'll just wait.

767
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
Oh, gosh, that's horrible.

768
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
You're amazing, Laura.

769
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
It's amazing what that looks like.

770
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,220
It's fucked up.

771
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
I don't know why I'm laughing. It's nerves.

772
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
It's complete adrenaline.

773
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,220
Oh, wow.

774
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Good work, team.

775
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
It's quite amazing, wasn't it, really?

776
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
I'll never forget this.

777
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
What a day.

778
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,220
That's the most intense thing

779
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,220
that has ever fucking happened to me in my entire life.

780
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,220
It was something that was almost caveman-like.

781
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,220
We just sort of behaved in this really uniform way

782
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,220
that I never thought that I had in me.

783
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Whoa!

784
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,220
And now we're gonna eat every single morsel,

785
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,220
not let one ounce of that little piggy go to waste.

786
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
H, we caught the pig.

787
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,220
Are you kidding? No.

788
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,220
That's what that is over there.

789
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
Are you kidding? I'm not fucking kidding.

790
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,220
Oh, my God, mind blown. I don't know what to say.

791
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,220
Thank you. Thank you!

792
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have...

793
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
Oh!

794
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
I'm so excited!

795
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Jeez, Louise!

796
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
Yep.

797
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
And, Harvey, we have a starter.

798
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,220
Oh, my God, I've just seen it in that bucket.

799
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Starters and me.

800
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Do you know what? You guys, you're just more of a woman

801
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
than I'll ever be, all of you.

802
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,220
Did you hear, George? Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

803
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Shit.

804
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
And...

805
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
My adrenaline is, like, through the roof.

806
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
Does it really get quite in the trap?

807
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
No, I was fast asleep and jumped it. Never.

808
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Oh, my God.

809
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,220
For 34-year-old Georgina, the pig means more than just dinner.

810
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Bloody hell, it's massive.

811
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm just so made up. We've got food.

812
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Oh, crap, I'm so happy.

813
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I can't tell you the feeling of absolute relief

814
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,220
that's just run through my entire body

815
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,220
at the thought of having some food.

816
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Lauren and Beth obviously do an incredible job.

817
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
I just can't believe it.

818
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
I could not have done that two and a half, three weeks ago.

819
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,220
If you'd have put me on the island and I'd have seen that ball,

820
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,220
I would have done my absolute most to stay away from it.

821
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,220
But I'm hungry now,

822
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,220
and my mind is not the same mind.

823
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
As it was three weeks ago.

824
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,220
The fire's all toasting, ready for it.

825
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Even the vegetarian in the group, Jamie, is relieved for Georgina.

826
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,220
I love it. It's brilliant.

827
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,220
They have big legs on that thing, aren't they?

828
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,220
Lots of big legs.

829
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I'm going to be on the bottom of me tonight.

830
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,220
The women will now have to butcher, skin and carve their kill.

831
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
It's not pleasant.

832
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Dead pig smells.

833
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Inside, I'm like...

834
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
You're going to be sick.

835
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
I've got to do it to survive.

836
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Oh, dear.

837
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,220
A little bit of shit came out.

838
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
I'm starving, are you?

839
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,220
The pig will provide the women with roughly 50,000 calories.

840
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,220
Some fat, if anyone wants some fat.

841
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,220
For the first time, they have more food

842
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
than they can possibly eat in one sitting.

843
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,220
How is it, George?

844
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
Warm.

845
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,220
We have not eaten like this for, like, over three weeks,

846
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,220
and, my God, it's been a long time coming.

847
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,220
Could you buy that in a restaurant?

848
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,220
That fresh, that's rib.

849
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Let's literally get the meat in my mouth now

850
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
and don't take it away.

851
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Mmm.

852
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,220
Harvey, I can see you eating that with your eyes closed.

853
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,220
Are you having an orgasm while you're eating it?

854
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Do you know what? I've never experienced this in my life.

855
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,220
I feel like a savage.

856
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,220
I've had so little calories in me every day,

857
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:59,220
and this pig may be my salvation.

858
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,220
You're going to turn it round now.

859
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
This will help you.

860
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,220
I've been rescued by the pig hunters.

861
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,220
My mother would be appalled if she saw me eating like this.

862
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Sorry, Mum.

863
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,220
The pork's providing the women with a valuable source

864
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,220
of protein, fat, vitamins, minerals,

865
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,220
but more importantly, it's giving them what I call

866
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,220
the golden window of opportunity.

867
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,220
The women have about three days to capitalise on that win.

868
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,220
This is their chance to improve their quality of life

869
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,220
and use that energy to regroup and hunt again.

870
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Hello, Mr Snake.

871
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
Hello, Mr Snake.

872
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,220
Look at that.

873
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
Now for the second course.

874
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,220
How are you feeling, Hobbs? Do you want to do it?

875
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,220
I'm going to do it. Go for it.

876
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,220
And despite her screamishness,

877
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
Havilah has volunteered to skin the snake.

878
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,220
Oh, look at that.

879
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,220
It's his oesophagus.

880
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,220
What it is?

881
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,220
I love to stuff a turkey at Christmas,

882
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
and it means you've got to get in the skin.

883
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
Ready? Like a sock.

884
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,220
Come on. Ready? There we go.

885
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
Wow. So, yeah, go very slow.

886
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
Yeah, got it.

887
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,220
Amazing.

888
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,220
I've just skinned a boa constrictor.

889
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,220
I'd never do that in my real life.

890
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,220
Well done. Not many girls could do that, you know.

891
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
Yeah. Not many.

892
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
And if anybody judges any of the girls,

893
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
here, for what they've done today,

894
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,220
they can fuck off.

895
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,220
I've been able to help everyone today,

896
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,220
and I'm really proud of that.

897
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
An incredible day.

898
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,220
Emotionally draining.

899
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,220
But the end result is that we have food,

900
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,220
and we'll be able to keep going for that bit longer.

901
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,220
Next time on The Women's Island...

902
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,220
Oh, my God!

903
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,220
That is the biggest shocker I've ever seen.

904
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,220
People are not prioritising the water,

905
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,220
and it's pissing me off.

906
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,220
The group is completely on their arse.

907
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,220
Julie! Julie!

908
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,220
I'm so weak.

909
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,220
We're going to have to pull the plug on this,

910
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,220
and I've got to think about removing you all from the island.

911
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Boy, I love your skill.

912
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
Fine, let's have some tea on that.

913
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Let's have some food but only at the hotel.

914
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
Thank you.

915
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,220
Oh, my God.

916
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,220
This is insane, really Rosa.

917
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,220
All right, everybody.

918
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,220
There it is.

919
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,220
I like it.

920
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,220
You're on theου

921
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,220
I like it.

922
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,220
Oh, wow.

923
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,220
Oh, wow.

924
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,220
Seriously.

925
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,220
I'm so killing it.

926
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,220
Irene, I want to go to the pool to see if my pod is cleaned up.

927
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,220
Well, I think we should go.

928
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,220
We were playing a game

929
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,220
and the only thing we were able to do

930
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,220
was bring Universal Neoер.
