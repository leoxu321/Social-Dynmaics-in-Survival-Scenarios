WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.700 --> 00:23.240
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be

00:23.240 --> 00:30.860
utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

00:30.860 --> 00:40.940
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental

00:40.940 --> 00:51.740
strength the Windsor day it's too cute I can't who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we

00:51.740 --> 00:52.980
follow the men's island

00:53.240 --> 01:05.300
it's a scorpion guys it'll be harder than ever they'll have to endure the height of the harsh

01:05.300 --> 01:10.700
tropical storm season a bit like being in a disaster film they'll have to find their own water

01:12.620 --> 01:21.380
and hunt for their own food watch him watch him go now go now that is amazing have these modern

01:21.380 --> 01:22.940
day men got what it takes

01:23.240 --> 01:29.240
to survive we're all sweating our bollocks off up there fella and it looks like yeah yeah looks

01:29.240 --> 01:30.980
like you're doing call when it comes to wood

01:34.700 --> 01:44.780
two weeks ago 14 British men were cast away on this remote Pacific Island

01:46.580 --> 01:52.460
that was the dumbest thing I ever did but now three of the men have quit now the dead weight's off let's get on with it

01:53.240 --> 01:57.200
there and the island has taken its toll on the 11 that remain

01:59.060 --> 02:01.460
I'm genuine I've never been so terrified in my life

02:03.680 --> 02:09.260
having barely found anything substantial to eat they're now on the brink of starvation

02:10.460 --> 02:13.580
we ain't conquered Jack nothing

02:23.240 --> 02:29.240
and they say nothing

02:29.240 --> 02:32.020
speaking of who you are

02:32.260 --> 02:34.920
scriptwriting

02:34.920 --> 02:40.340
it's a bit like being in a disaster film or you know or when um you hear on the

02:40.340 --> 02:48.920
news that people have had a typhoon come through or a flood there's no water there's no electricity

02:48.920 --> 02:50.600
you know stomachache

02:50.600 --> 02:51.600
car is definitely needs some organます

02:51.600 --> 02:52.820
could you get on with the show

02:52.820 --> 02:55.840
like you've been hit by a major disaster.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.260
Oh, look, another day in paradise.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.040
It's been 15 days since the men arrived on the island.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.600
And so far, they have survived on a meager diet

03:20.600 --> 03:24.840
of a few hundred calories a day.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.260
So thin now, like ribs, all sorts of bones

03:30.260 --> 03:35.380
appearing that I haven't seen since I was a bloody teenager.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.760
Oh, hang on.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.000
Oh, hang on.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.620
Lie down, mate, if you've.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.220
Oh.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.900
It's the nearest I've got to fainting,

03:47.900 --> 03:50.000
or I assume it's fainting, having never

03:50.000 --> 03:50.600
fainted before.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.140
But my vision just went, like, pulsating in and out,

03:54.140 --> 03:56.420
in and out, in and out, in and out.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.300
And then before I knew it, I was on my ass.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.220
Sort of semi-collapsed.

04:06.420 --> 04:10.820
We're surviving off limpets and, like, the odd one fish.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.720
It's not going to sustain us for the next god-how-ever weeks.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.220
I think another week of this, we'll be struggling massively

04:17.220 --> 04:19.080
just to even get up in the morning.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.000
We need to find a way.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.740
We need to find a solid source of food or, you know,

04:24.740 --> 04:26.000
we're going to be facing meltdown.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.240
We're out of food.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.700
The bottom line is we don't have any food other than limpets.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.780
We're getting weaker and weaker.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.940
I certainly feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker.

04:35.940 --> 04:40.480
So my priority is how I feel about, personally, is food.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.160
I think the majority of our resources

04:42.160 --> 04:45.940
should be to getting us good fish today.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.240
Let's go.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.660
We are going to find lunch.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Come on, fishy, fishy, fishy.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
In a survival situation, you always face one huge dilemma.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.700
And that is, if you want to eat, you've got to hunt.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.440
Hunting burns your energy.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.500
And there's no guarantee you're actually going to catch

05:08.500 --> 05:10.360
anything at the end of it.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.940
Any glimmers yet, Vic?

05:11.940 --> 05:13.180
Oh, I can see fish.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.920
Can you?

05:14.920 --> 05:18.000
Bastard, you.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Every time you go looking for food, you're gambled.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You're gambling.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You're gambling with your energy reserves.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You know what, Pidge?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You seem to be a bit lacking in enthusiasm.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, I'm so dead on my feet.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm actually dead on my feet.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I feel just completely gone.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
You just keep nibbling it straight off the end.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The luck of the gods is not with us today.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Everyone's getting tired.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Everyone's hungry.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Everyone's sick of bacon limpets.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
We need some decent food.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
We need it quick.

05:56.000 --> 06:10.500
If we don't get it soon, we're just going to start dropping like fires.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.000
Despite the group's desperation, one man refuses to be beaten.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Let's all push it to the edge.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I feel fine.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Another day at the office.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
I feel really good, yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
Vic wants to change tactics and take the hunt to an unexplored part of the island.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
One kilometer from camp is a vast freshwater lagoon where he believes a much bigger prize

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
could be lurking.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
One that could provide the group with the calories they so desperately need.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
We are going hunting for fish.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
We are going hunting for Mr. Cayman.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's go lay some traps, fellas.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Let's go hunt some beast.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
As well as the search for food, the men's survival depends on them having a constant supply of drinking water.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
They need at least 30 liters a day, which they must collect on a back-breaking two-kilometer round trip.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Sam, when you go past Carl, can you ask him to come and help do the water run, please?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
He's not shirking, is he?

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Hey, I'm just saying the water run he's doing, and he's chewing his gums.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You do the maths.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
All right.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Let's go.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Grab Carl.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Kyle, are those crocs going to be okay for going across to get some water?

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Uh, there's nothing else knocking about to do water.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I've done a lot of mileage the last few days.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I think I'd rather do something a bit more camp-based today.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I've done water two days in a row, mate.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So this is my third day, so, you know.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate it.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, we've got 11 people here.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
But they're not here now, mate.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Uh, Carl, why don't we just sit here and tidy the camp, then?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I'll do it.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That's no problem, mate.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Cheers.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Cheers.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Thanks, Piers.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
All right.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Off we go.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I just sat in the office in front of the screens.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I know there's more to life than that.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
So I just got to a stage where I wanted to break away from it, step away from the screens,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
and just do something different.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I like to think I can step up to most challenges.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I like to see myself as someone who will see things through to the end.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
So if I was a person who was struggling in the group and was a useless one,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
that would be a big knock to my confidence.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Big knock.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I was a little disappointed in Kyle.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
It would have been nice if he just stepped up to the plate and said,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
you know what, I'll step in.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
But he wasn't in the mood to do that today.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's not so much that I'm hungry.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
The worst thing is just the energy.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
I never for a second thought my energy would be as low as it has been.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Fuck.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I can't even lift up my legs.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Now keep an eye out for Mr. Fucking Yurt.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
See a caiman, I'll scream.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yes.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
How big did they say they get?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Fuck, there's not many of these.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Six foot, the caiman, and six meters, the alligator.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh, these are alligators?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Fuck it.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't know where Vic gets his energy, but I need half of that energy.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Because Vic has got energy all the way through the day.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
If I could take anything away from this island,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I would like to be a little bit more like Vic Fellows.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
See, like that.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That is actual shit.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
What the fuck is this, Jurassic Park?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That's not shit.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
That's shit.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
That's not shit, fella.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What is it?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's mud out of here.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Do you know what it is?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm sure there's a T-Rex here.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, fuck, that's great.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
What do you do if you see something snapping at your feet?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
What are you going to do?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Are you going to just machete it?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Worst case scenario, we can't pin him or what have you.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I'm fighting for my life.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
It's happening, isn't it?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
As best as a facilities manager can do.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm 47.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
This could be my last crazy hurrah.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
And what better way to do it than the ultimate challenge

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
of surviving?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I mean, it's the ultimate challenge.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Can I provide for me?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yes, I am very excited.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It's Boy Scouts shit, isn't it?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
We're all over it.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
We get knives and spears and stuff,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
maybe even a bow and arrow to make.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I mean...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
How good does it get?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Excited is an understatement.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Yes, sometimes I have to keep...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
..put a lid on it to not let it get like,

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
boom, shiz!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That kind of excitement, yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Just keep quiet, keep quiet, guy,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
cos if there is a croc, we'll see it.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Where do caimans live?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I don't know.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I presume they lived in the water.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I thought they lived up trees.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Do caimans live in holes?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I reckon caimans live in holes.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Oh, dear.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, I'm making that up, but...

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It sounds good, though.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I think I've got something in my bollocks

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
that's coming out.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Crocodiles are ambush predators.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
They hunt their prey in shallow waters

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and are masters of the stealth attack.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
We'll raise a sharp tee,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
and a bite that's three times more powerful than a lion.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Shhh.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Sam, shhh.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
That is a caiman.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Look, he's up, he's up.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Fuck, he's a biggie.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Now, there is our baby.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
That is dinner, yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That is our dinner.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
We can get in there.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Would it be worth swimming in?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Not for me.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm not swimming in that.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Not a chance.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That is insanity, yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Fucking bastard, him.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Look, look, look, he's moving.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
He's moving.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Got a bit of a ripple behind him.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Look at that sign in that fucking head.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
He's an inquisitive, he's a little boy, isn't he?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Come to daddy.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We now need to find where he comes in and goes out.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
OK.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Wherever we are now is where they come out.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Dead right.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
That is where crocs come out of the water.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, that is perfect, isn't it?

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm going to make a snare there, right towards the water.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Have you ever caught anything that snared before?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Have I ever made a snare before?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
No.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Oh, he's there, he's about.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
He's back, he's back.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Where, where, where?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Straight through here.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Straight through here.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
See him?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
He fucking has got closer as well, hasn't he?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
That shifty little bastard has got closer, hasn't he?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
He's not scared of us.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
He'll have to keep an eye on him.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Well, I'm setting the trap.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That's why I keep looking past you.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
He keeps dropping and dunnies that bugger him.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
The men have had just two days' survival training

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
where they learnt how to set basic traps.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
But the reality of catching a crocodile

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
that can measure up to 13 feet is a different matter entirely.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
This is proper Boy Scout shit, this, isn't it?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
He's going to test it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I'll test it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Oh!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Dinner is served.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Oh!

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Eh?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
That's not bad, is it?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
That's all right, fellas.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Oh!

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
That's the one.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Let's go.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Let's bust a move.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Back to base, yeah?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Back to base.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Late afternoon.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
58-year-old Phil is returning from the water run

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
with the help from Dr Pearce.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Watch your step.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It's a good thing we didn't carry over the jerry can

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
up and down these rocks.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Whoo!

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And home.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
While Kyle continues to rest on the beach.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
There's a feeling amongst Camden

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
he's not contributing as much as he should be.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's just I feel like I've just been trying to deal with the fire

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and do the water,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
and Kyle's been kind of doing the feet manicuring bit.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It's a little bit like anything in life, you know.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
You can have a rest, but do the work first.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
It's been almost two weeks since Kyle ensured the group's survival

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
by starting a fire with his guys.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And now he's got his glasses.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Now, when Kyle first got in here, he cracked the fire.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It was absolutely brilliant.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Since then, man's not got a day's graft in him.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Not a freaking day's graft in him.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I get the distinct impression, Vic, that you're getting a bit miffed.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm just getting miffed by anybody that springs into my mind

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
that's not sweating as hard as me.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Pull your thumb out of your arse, you lazy bastard.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Todd?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I feel like I'm kind of nearing my physical limit,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
and I think it's quite a common event I'll come down

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
and you're doing your feet or you're sitting by the fire.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I feel that perhaps you haven't been pulling your weight

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
in the last week or so, OK?

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Today, for me, has been a bit of a challenging one, actually.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Can't lie.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I haven't been able to do as much as I thought I would be able to,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
and, like, when you're in this situation,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
if you can't contribute,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
you feel like you're really letting the team down.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Despite the men's best efforts,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
it's yet another day with empty stomachs.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Bloody hell.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Boys, there's no meat on you.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You need a bit of cake.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Hey, look, you can see Piers' heart beating through his rib, look.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Fucking hell.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Being hungry...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
..really...

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
..does affect your mental and your physical state.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Every step is hard when you're hungry.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
There would be a stage where, soon,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
our bodies give up on us.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And we're not far from that.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
How are you feeling now?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Exhausted.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
After over two weeks of near starvation,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
the men's situation is becoming critical.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Desperate to catch a high-calorie prize,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Vic and Dan have decided to go on a diet.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's been a long, long journey.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Vic and Dan have set multiple crocodile traps

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
around the island's freshwater lagoon.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Bingo.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
But so far, they haven't caught a thing.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
By the look of it, it's done sod all.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Fuck.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Shit.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Nothing, I'm afraid.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
On such an extreme low-calorie diet,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
you're susceptible to infection

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and your mental capacity is low.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
And if nothing changes,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
really, you're on borrowed time.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Over two weeks with barely any food going in,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
the men's morning routines are anything but regular.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I feel like it's got to that moment where

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm probably going to need to go for a shit-sink.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
When it comes to options,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
if they've got land or sea,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I think I'm going to opt for the sea.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Where are you going to go?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't know.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I need to figure out, is it sort of wash in that direction or...?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
He's going for it.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Carl's taking a dump in the sea.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Good man.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, the most beautiful spot in the world to take a dump in.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Have you joined the poo crew?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So, I'm one for, back at home,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
maybe a four to five shit a day, man.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
A day? A day?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I'm pretty good, I'm very regular.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And I haven't shat until half six this morning

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and now I feel enlightened.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm now part of the poo crew.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
But 28-year-old Piers, the group's doctor,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
isn't having as much success.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
How's your, um...

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
How are the bowels? Bowels?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Any movement yet?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Being stubborn.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Wow. No poo for 15 days.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
It'll come.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Are you ready? One, two, three.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
With no food to eat,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
the men still have to expend their energy on vital tasks,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
like keeping their fire going

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
to boil and purify the water that they collect.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Hello, hello.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
If you want to get a nice picture of Carl grooming himself,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
you're quite welcome to do that while we're all getting wood.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Where's that? Just round the corner, doing his toes after.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
He's just had a swim.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Today, we were supposed to all contribute getting wood

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
and then do individual tasks,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and he has done nothing.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
I think my tolerance has kind of reached a bit of a limit.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
You know, if you do let it boil inside,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
it does become a bit of a problem when it comes to a head,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
like it is now.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I can't hold something. I can't.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
But, listen, when everybody...

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
And it ain't just me.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
When lots of people bitch and chaff

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and nobody seems to want us to confront it,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I think, come on, boys, we're team-mates.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Fuck it.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Where is he?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Up there, sound his arse.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
He's taking piss. Come on, man, fucking hell.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Kyle!

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Kyle.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
How you doing?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm busting my knackers, fella, doing wood,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
and you're doing your feet.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm not doing my feet. I've come out of the water.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Whatever.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
It's not just me.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
It just seems that I'm the only one with balls

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
to come up and speak to you.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
No, that's fine.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Every fucker's bitching and moaning

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
that you're never doing wood with us.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
We're all sweating our bollocks off up there, fella,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
and it looks like...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Looks like you're doing fuck all when it comes to wood.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Admittedly, I'm not getting wood now,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
cos I've just come out of the water,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
cos I went through shit.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
We're fucking pulling tree upon tree upon tree,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and it does look like you're always doing your feet.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I won't lie to you, it does.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Let's go.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
It was almost like a bit of a cheap shot from Vic.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
He's clearly got stuff which has been bubbling under the surface.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I felt like...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
..I haven't fitted in with the group,

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
and, you know, I've done stuff to try and change that.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
But sometimes it's just the group dynamics

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
that's on for everyone.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
People are starting to fray around the edges.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Some of them are fraying,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
some of them are coming away at the seams.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
We seriously, seriously need to find

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
a sustainable source of food.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
As the men continue to physically decline,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
the group is becoming fractured,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and if members of the group are perceived

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
not to be pulling their weight,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
they can easily become alienated.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And then if those rifts aren't healed,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
it becomes a downward spiral of conflict

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
that ultimately could destroy the men's community.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Hello.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
There's a net here. A net?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh, yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Mate, this could be big.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
This could make a big difference to us.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Game-changer.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Game-changer.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Could be.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Fellas!

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Look what I found!

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
We've got ourselves a gill net!

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Whoo-hoo!

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Fucking brilliant.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It's pretty fucking big!

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah!

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Get in there, baby!

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
What a whale!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Nice one, Will!

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Sting of the dog!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Yes!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Roar, roar!

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Brilliant.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Let's get ourselves some tea.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
If we get this net in the water,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
then we have our best hope yet of catching fish.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
For thousands of years,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
fishermen have been perfecting the art

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
of setting their fishing nets.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
If you get it right, you unlock the ocean's larder.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
If you get it wrong,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
then all they'll be doing is wasting their precious time

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
and precious energy,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
two resources that they can't afford to waste.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Net's out. Exciting times.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
What are we looking at?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Feel quite positive.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I think it will catch fish.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I think it might even catch fish for us tonight.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Exhausted after a morning's hard work,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
the men allow themselves some downtime.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So, boys, here's one.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
You can request Bear to bring you one item

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
for the journey back.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Thermos full of English breakfast tea.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I am going to get a bottle of octomar whisky.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
A whole bottle of whisky?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
A whole bottle of octomar whisky for my journey back.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Bam!

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
If I could...

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
..chicken pie my wife makes,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
and she always puts your name in it as well.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Nice.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
All the big love art and all that sort of thing.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Pock pastry lid?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Yes, dead right.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
It's quite easy.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You see if it doesn't work out with you and your missus,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
can you give her our number?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I honestly think there's something wrong with her upstairs

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
because she really is a nice woman.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
How did you find such a nice woman?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
I have no idea.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
What have you done?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You must have a size of a dick and a donkey.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Not a clue.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Not a clue, but God bless her.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
How did you meet your wife, if you don't mind me asking?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I went round and knocked on her door.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Did you?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I fucking did, yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Dead right I did, yeah.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
What did you say?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Hello, I saw you at work today.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You turned up to meet your mate.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, yeah, I did, yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I wondered if I could take you out.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Er, let me think about it.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I thought, oh, damn it, she went.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, OK, then.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
That was it.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's such a romantic that you live on the set of Billy Elliot

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
meets Postman Pat.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Absolutely brilliant, it was.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
So, yeah, well done, mate.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Well done, you, man.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Glad you.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Sport with peers.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Trotting along the beach, looking vaguely happy with himself.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
So I think Piers might be off to try and have poo number one.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
How many days has he been without poo?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
He's 17.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Dr Piers is now the only member of the group

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
who has not yet joined the poo crew.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Any luck, mate?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
No luck today, mate.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Here we come.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Here he comes.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Don't do it.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Dr Piers.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Dr Piers?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Have we succeeded?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Is it?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Is it?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
No.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Oh, no.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
No!

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Mission failure.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh, no.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
NASA, we have a problem.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Close.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Be patient, lads.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Be patient.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Go in your medical kit, get a rubber glove, because I'm going in.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Have fun, boys.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Cheers, mate.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
We'll do our best.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Mid-afternoon.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
After a couple of hours' rest,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
the men get back to work.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Come on, my son.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Bite.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Two weeks ago, they were dropped on the island

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
with eight fishing hooks,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
but now they're down to just two.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Shit.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Could you unsnag my line?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I've caught it on the rock.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Shit.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
No, we've lost another rod there, guys.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Shit.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
We've lost a hook.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Further down the beach,

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
oil engineer Dan and Dr Piers swim out to check the net.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What do we think we've done?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Nothing.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
What do we think, William?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Do you think there's going to be anything on there?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
You're saying it.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
There's lots of rocks.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Anything, Barney?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
No, sadly not.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
We're hoping for the nets.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So I've got to see this moment.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Doesn't look like a trawl.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
No, I guess far as it says, it looks like the square root of Eiffel.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
What's wrong?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It looks like we'll be going hungry for dinner.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Huh?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
It looks like we'll be eating ass.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
The nets are empty.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Is that right?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Shit.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
What's happening, fella?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
This is what we've caught.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Caught a load of coral.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Fuck.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
The razor sharp coral has taken over the water.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
It's gone.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It's gone.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
It's gone.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
It's gone.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
It's gone.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
It's gone.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
It's gone.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
It's gone.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
It's gone.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
It's gone.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It's gone.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
It's gone.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
The razor sharp coral has destroyed the men's net.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
No fish at all.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Oh.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Shit.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
We really are up Chips Creek, aren't we?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
With no net, one fishing hook.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Situation just went from bad to much, much worse.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
What do you think, Phil?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, that's disastrous.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
That's no food for anyone, and no means to get food.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Shit.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
We've got one hook in the net.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Done.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Done.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Done.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Done.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Done.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Done.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Done.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Done.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Done.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Done.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Done.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Done.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Done.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Done.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Done.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Done.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.200
Shit, we've got one hook left. We're fucked.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.800
So, we've got one hook to fish for a month.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.080
It's pretty depressing, yeah? More than one.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.000
No joy with nets.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.160
Fuck, are we going to be depleted, or what?

27:52.320 --> 27:54.240
Disaster.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.880
We're down to our last fishing hook.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.840
So...

27:58.880 --> 28:01.240
the onset of starvation looks upon us.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
With morale at rock bottom, Barney, Phil and Sam Farmer

28:11.040 --> 28:15.160
head out to the lagoon for the daily check of Vic's crocodile traps.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.200
Chances of catching a caiman, 4%.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.600
The caiman's definitely been here.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.920
How do you know that? Because the trap is destroyed.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.000
Gosh, look at that.

28:33.040 --> 28:36.040
It's almost certain that it's been here for a long time.

28:36.080 --> 28:36.960
It's been here for a long time.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.960
It's certainly been triggered by a caiman.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.960
The bait's gone, the trigger's occurred,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.640
and it looks like there's been a bit of a struggle,

28:44.680 --> 28:46.920
and the rope is firmly in the water.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.320
Well, that is incredibly encouraging in one sense.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.560
Very.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.360
Is there any chance that the caiman could still be on the end?

28:52.400 --> 28:54.360
There is a chance.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.200
OK.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.280
Fuck, he is.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.760
Is he? Shit.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
I think he's under here, isn't he?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.040
Is that his back? No way.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.840
Is this his back here?

29:02.880 --> 29:03.880
Come here.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.880
We need to be a bit careful about this.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.000
I can see scales on the back of that rope.

29:12.080 --> 29:17.080
I can see there are crocodile or caiman-like scales

29:17.120 --> 29:19.400
just underneath the water.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.000
I'm convinced... Go and have a look.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.000
I'm convinced he's there.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.840
Just be careful. Be very careful.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.920
He's there.

29:31.960 --> 29:32.920
He's there.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.400
Just be careful. Be very careful.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.960
There's no doubt about it, the caiman's there.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah.

29:41.800 --> 29:45.520
There is a caiman in the water right next to us now.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.120
We need to be careful, cos as soon as we drag him out there,

29:48.160 --> 29:50.040
he's going to be angry.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.720
I can't quite... I cannot quite believe it.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.560
No, I can't either.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.840
I cannot believe it.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.880
My heart... Mine too.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.600
Is your heart beating? Mine too, cos he's obviously alive, right?

30:02.920 --> 30:03.920
Yeah.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.920
So, the crocodile is the largest, it's the meatiest animal

30:07.960 --> 30:09.720
they're going to find on the island.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.160
But when they're cornered or they're scared,

30:12.200 --> 30:14.320
that's when they're most likely to attack.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.400
And if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,

30:17.440 --> 30:18.800
you're in trouble.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.960
The minute we disturb this, all hell will break loose.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.720
The three of us could take him on.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.720
I think it's sensible to go and get many more hands.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.080
I want you two to stay here. I'll run back to camp.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.960
Yeah. Deliver the news. Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.560
And we're going to pull him out of that trap.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.680
He's going to fight like buggery. Absolutely.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.840
Go on, Barney. Excellent. Yes!

30:43.400 --> 30:46.920
Crocodiles can remain submerged for hours before surfacing.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.920
And as a lagoon is their ideal habitat,

30:50.960 --> 30:54.400
it's certain to be populated by more than just one.

30:54.440 --> 30:58.400
There's definitely an alligator moving this way.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.520
It's a little bit weird looking at one that could get you right here.

31:02.560 --> 31:07.000
And another one that's heading towards you.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.600
It's almost like, where the bait?

31:10.640 --> 31:13.120
Barney's looking excited. What's up, Barney?

31:13.160 --> 31:14.720
OK, come in, come in. Gather in, gather in.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.520
OK, so we're...

31:23.720 --> 31:27.200
He's ready. I'd say we're 95% sure

31:27.240 --> 31:29.160
we've got a caiman in our second trap.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.200
Fuck off. Let's rock and roll, boys.

31:32.240 --> 31:32.440
Let's rock and roll.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.760
Let's rock and roll.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.120
I think we nailed it.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.880
Let's go. Let's go.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.200
Oh, this is exciting. This is exciting.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.080
Bingo, big fella.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.400
It's either that or a scaly log.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.400
A scaly log we will eat.

31:46.440 --> 31:50.240
Despite being too exhausted to help with the group's daily tasks,

31:50.280 --> 31:55.440
the prospect of a crocodile feast has inspired Kyle to join the hunting pack.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.480
Let's do it, lads.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.200
I feel like Gandalf with my giant...

32:02.200 --> 32:04.200
I feel like Gandalf with my giant shaft.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.240
How are you feeling, Barney?

32:10.280 --> 32:12.760
It's very difficult because I'm so excited and this is all what we want,

32:12.800 --> 32:15.760
but when it comes to actually pulling the animal out and having to kill it,

32:15.800 --> 32:17.760
I don't know how I feel at all.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.760
For the moment, absolutely buzzing.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.120
Yeah, definitely feel like a tribe on a hunt.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.120
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

32:23.160 --> 32:25.480
Everyone's come out prepared.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.000
Oh, this is the most excitement I've felt since I've bloody been here.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.160
How are you feeling, Vic?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.080
I'm feeling excited.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.080
But we've got a job to do, we dispatch it in a humane manner as we can.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.640
But, woohoo, that's how I'm feeling.

32:40.680 --> 32:44.600
When you're hunting crocs, you've got to make sure that you don't become the prey

32:44.640 --> 32:47.280
because these prehistoric beasts are fast.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.880
Once they get a hold of you, grab you, drag you into the water,

32:50.920 --> 32:55.320
then they strike, bam, lightning speed and incredible power.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.960
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

33:01.000 --> 33:01.920
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

33:01.920 --> 33:02.760
What's weird is I can see it and it's got its eye open.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.200
This thing is going to go absolutely mental.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.640
Absolutely mental when it comes out.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.800
Such a blessing. It's a dangerous animal, but we need the food.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.120
We need the food.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.800
This way, guys. Barney.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.560
I've got the cavalry.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.840
Putting on the cavalry.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.040
Where is it?

33:20.080 --> 33:23.920
It literally is just where you can see that blue rope by the log.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.080
The blue rope is wrapped around the caiman.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.560
Oh!

33:28.600 --> 33:30.120
He's big, boys, he's big.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.120
OK, he's moving.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.400
We need to get a loop over that mouth.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.080
I think one of these branches has him pinned.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.600
He's making bubbles, I think he's going to do something.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.800
Here we go, there we go.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.400
Look at that beauty.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.400
He needs to breathe, doesn't he?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.320
He's hissing at us.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.280
OK, he's trying to go back.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.840
Here we go, boys.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.240
Right, where's that rope with the hook?

33:51.280 --> 33:52.760
Here, look, look.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.320
OK, boys, we need two people on that rope.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.000
We need to pull him ashore.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.240
Is his mouth open?

33:58.280 --> 34:00.920
His mouth is slightly open.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.200
OK, big.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.400
Nice and calmly, boys.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.880
Come on, big.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.440
Whoa, come on, baby.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.440
Come on, big.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.440
Right, nobody moves, his mouth's open.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.440
Yeah, you get him, you get him.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.960
You fucking get him.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.040
Round his neck, round his neck.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.040
That's it, we got you, little sod.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.040
Come on, big boy.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.040
Come on, boys, come on.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.040
Right, I'll distract him.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.040
Hey, Mr Croc.

34:30.080 --> 34:30.760
Hey.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.640
Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.200
OK, OK, Vic, go now, go now.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.760
He's probably going to roll soon.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.320
Over the teeth, over the teeth.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.040
Oh, branch, one more, one more.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.160
Mate, mate, mate, you've almost got it.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.880
Watch him, watch him, go now, go now.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.320
You're in, you're in, you're in, you're in, you're in.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.520
Here we go, puppy dog.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.600
Yes, yes.

34:53.640 --> 34:54.600
Ah, you little fucker.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.920
Watch him, watch him.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.240
Right, Sam, I'm very conscious of you stood in the water, mate.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.200
There is another one in that lake.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.440
Yeah, get out of there.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.640
Yeah, get on the bank, Sam.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.520
Sam, Sam.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.040
Sam, watch his tail.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.280
Sam, get out of the water, mate.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.640
Mate, mate, I think we're good.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.760
No, see, there is another one in this lake.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.840
If he came along and nipped your heel...

35:15.880 --> 35:18.040
Let's just fucking get this guy.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.880
Have we got enough people tugging on that rope?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.520
Yeah, yeah, Charles has got it.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.480
There we go.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.760
Right, we now have two.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.360
That's it.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.840
He can still snap, can't he?

35:26.880 --> 35:28.680
Watch his tail on your legs.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.040
I am on it, I'm on it, don't worry.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.040
All right.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.480
And again, Barney, and again, Barney.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.160
No, no, no, look what it's snagged on now.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.600
Right, it's snagged on this one.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.000
Take your time, fellas.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.600
Right, don't cut the rope.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.480
Oh, shit, he's growling.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.280
This fucker is fucking powerful.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.120
Give him a minute.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.960
I think he speaks English.

35:48.000 --> 35:48.960
Where's the knife?

35:49.000 --> 35:49.800
I've got a knife with me.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.120
Get the knife out ready.

35:51.160 --> 35:53.000
And then, Kyle, what are you doing?

35:53.040 --> 35:54.680
You're going to drive the knife, take him out.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.320
Right, where are you going to put it?

35:56.360 --> 35:58.480
Just behind his eyes, let's go.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.080
Heads on, guys, heads on, heads on.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.320
We go on go.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.960
One, two, three, we all go on go.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.160
One.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.400
Two, three, go.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.280
Come on, boys, get in there, get in there.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.000
Drive it out, drive it out.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.800
Go on, lads, push it in.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.720
Push it, lads, that's the one, boys.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
That's it, that's it.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.120
Yes, mate, yes.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.640
That's it.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.360
Gentlemen, we have handbags.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.320
Come on.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.000
Nice teamwork.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.200
Look them down, boys.

36:31.240 --> 36:31.920
Come on.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.560
Come on, boys.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.520
Back it up.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.160
Come on, boys.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.600
Oh, he's twitching, he's twitching, he's moving.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.800
Kyle, fucking killer blow, mate.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.000
That was awesome.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.560
Get in there, boys.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.840
Woo!

36:46.880 --> 36:48.400
Actually wrapping up a dinosaur.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.520
We just caught a prehistoric animal.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.760
Damn it.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.520
Amazing.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.400
It feels so caveman.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.080
Doesn't it?

36:55.120 --> 36:56.280
Doesn't it feel so caveman?

36:56.320 --> 36:57.080
Yes.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.080
If Fierce doesn't shit after eating a load of this,

37:02.120 --> 37:03.320
he's got a serious problem.

37:03.360 --> 37:04.360
I know, just.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.160
How many people in the world can say,

37:12.200 --> 37:14.200
wrestle the crocodile that killed him?

37:14.240 --> 37:16.360
We are in an elite group of blokes.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.880
After 17 days without anything substantial to eat,

37:19.920 --> 37:22.520
the men have finally hit the jackpot

37:22.560 --> 37:25.520
and dispatched one of nature's most fearsome predators.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.120
Seeing this, it does make you have respect for crocodiles.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.680
This is a big one, really big one.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.520
So I just wanted to get it done in a clean way

37:31.560 --> 37:32.720
without making a mess of it.

37:32.760 --> 37:35.400
To pull it off and grab a croc like this is amazing.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.600
Should we rock and roll then, boys?

37:36.640 --> 37:37.400
Yeah.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.560
One, two, three, up.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.160
Kyle.

37:41.200 --> 37:41.840
Yeah.

37:41.880 --> 37:44.240
What would you be doing in your normal life right now?

37:44.280 --> 37:46.200
Back home, it'd be a bit more mundane than this.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.320
I definitely wouldn't have a croc on my shoulders.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.360
Seriously, look how much meat there is on that bad boy.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.480
Fucking awesome.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.840
Not only have the men proved

37:56.880 --> 37:58.960
that they're top of the island's food chain,

37:58.960 --> 38:02.320
but after surviving on roughly 400 or 500 calories a day,

38:02.360 --> 38:07.000
suddenly they've landed themselves a feast of just epic proportions.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.120
Just think of that fucking delicious dinner we're going to have later, boys.

38:10.160 --> 38:13.840
News of the big catch soon spreads around the island.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.080
Come on, fellas.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.840
Oh, my God.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.920
Holy shit.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.000
Oh, my God.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.240
No fucking way.

38:25.280 --> 38:28.440
You are absolutely shitting me.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.760
That is absolutely enormous.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.640
That's amazing, isn't it?

38:37.680 --> 38:39.800
That is amazing.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.640
Woo-hoo!

38:43.680 --> 38:44.960
Keep going, lads.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.720
Fucking hell.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.080
And roll, roll.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.320
Get in there, boys.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.240
Yeah!

38:54.280 --> 38:55.280
Woo!

38:55.320 --> 38:56.280
Yeah!

38:56.320 --> 38:57.280
Yeah!

38:57.320 --> 38:58.240
Yeah!

38:58.440 --> 38:59.440
Woo-hoo!

38:59.480 --> 39:00.440
Come on, lads!

39:00.480 --> 39:01.440
Come on, lads!

39:06.560 --> 39:08.840
A crock of this size could provide the men

39:08.880 --> 39:10.960
with tens of thousands of calories.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.640
What do you think of that, big boy?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.760
That's beautiful.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.280
Give some respect to him.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.560
Out of the water, trapped, dispatched, we in 15, 20 minutes.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.560
Yeah.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.560
That's brilliant.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.600
I'm pleased about that.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.800
We were very respectful of her.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.400
Oh, my God.

39:28.440 --> 39:31.040
I think I can see a plate of meat coming along.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.360
Oh, hello.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.680
Look at this, boys.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.680
As if you didn't need any more motivation.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.000
Today, I managed to catch a bloody crocodile.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.080
And my God, was it something.

39:44.120 --> 39:48.600
I'm normally at a desk or on a phone talking to clients.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.440
I don't kill crocodiles.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.840
Carl, look at that.

39:53.880 --> 39:54.840
Oh, mate.

39:54.880 --> 39:55.880
Get in.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.440
Unbelievable.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.360
Wow.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.880
Look at that.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.960
Let the feast begin, boys.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.960
Yes.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.720
Boys get stuck in, it's like chicken.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
That is wonderful.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.560
Just had my first taste of crocodile.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.080
To me, it just tasted absolutely divine.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.920
It's nice to have a mouthful of meat, isn't it?

40:26.960 --> 40:28.080
Not just a nibble.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.560
We all get more than we can possibly eat.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.240
Here's the heart.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.160
This is Kyle's, the killer.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.640
Kyle, salute you, sir.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.120
Based on the fact that I killed the croc,

40:41.160 --> 40:43.400
I was given the privilege of eating his heart.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.400
It felt like a good feeling.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.600
Almost like a prize for doing a good job.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.600
Go on, Kyle.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.040
I feel like you're inheriting its strength.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.040
Like a boss.

40:56.080 --> 40:56.600
Yeah.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.360
Oh, f**k, that was nice.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.520
God, that was nice.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.880
Oh, that second piece I took was beautiful.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.640
Oh, God, I feel like it's after Sunday dinner at home.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.920
Absolutely lovely.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.120
What a lovely, lovely feeling that is.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.000
I feel sorry for Piers,

41:18.040 --> 41:19.480
because he needs to open his bowels,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.200
otherwise it's going to be painful.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.040
Oh, he's going to open them after this.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.400
So I was absolutely dead on my feet.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.320
I was completely and utterly gone.

41:30.360 --> 41:34.880
And suddenly, the morale boost the team needed,

41:34.920 --> 41:39.320
needed that so badly, to kick the spirits up.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.320
I think this counts as just for today,

41:42.360 --> 41:44.320
if nothing else, more than surviving.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.680
6am.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.520
MUSIC PLAYS

41:55.520 --> 41:59.200
Dr Piers is feeling the benefit of last night's feast.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.880
Here, you've got some big news for me.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.440
Yeah, I am the last member of the poo club.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.160
Well done, Piers.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.320
Do you want to give Piers a round of applause?

42:13.360 --> 42:14.400
Yes!

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
Yes, Piers.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.440
Brilliant.

42:16.480 --> 42:17.920
Yes, Piers.

42:17.960 --> 42:18.880
How did it feel?

42:18.920 --> 42:20.560
It felt great, actually.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.520
Really good.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.600
I thought it was going to be really hard.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.480
I thought it was going to be like rabbit droppings.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.800
It's stuck together.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.720
Oh, what was it like?

42:28.760 --> 42:30.160
Like a wet sausage.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.160
A wet sausage?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.160
Yeah.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.160
Dreamy.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.400
Absolutely dreamy.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.400
Yeah.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.880
It's that crock pushed it all down.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.520
Lads, crock's ready.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.840
With plenty of crocodile meat still left over,

42:46.880 --> 42:49.920
cameraman Ross serves up breakfast.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.760
Char-grilled to smoky perfection.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.600
Oh, that's good, isn't it?

42:54.600 --> 42:55.840
I think it's better.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.720
I think it's better than yesterday.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.600
With their bellies full, the men set about their daily chores.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.080
Look at that.

43:10.120 --> 43:15.400
We have done wood in the same time it took Kyle to get dressed.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.200
Tell me that ain't the greatest thing.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.560
Right, right.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.920
Team effort, boys.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.080
I feel like I can just lie on this beach right now

43:28.120 --> 43:30.080
and think about nothing and do nothing

43:30.120 --> 43:33.080
and not feel guilty for the first time pretty much since we got here.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.080
Does this feel personal collection, though?

43:35.120 --> 43:36.080
This is only for me.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.080
I thought so, mate.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.080
A bit slower.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.080
I thought that.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.080
A bit slower.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.080
That's it.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.080
That's it.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.080
It's working.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.080
Oh, what?

43:44.120 --> 43:45.080
That's it.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.080
That's it.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.080
That's it.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
That's it.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.160
That's it.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.200
That's it.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.240
That's it.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.280
That's it.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.320
That's it.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.440
That's it.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.600
That's it.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.640
Lovely.

43:56.680 --> 44:00.640
Enjoy the idyllic tropical sunshine.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.640
I think life isn't too bad after all.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.880
For the second night in a row,

44:12.920 --> 44:16.480
the men anticipate a hearty feast of crocodile meat.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.760
Does everyone fancy the last of the crock?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.920
I would love a bit.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.320
As well as giving the group vital calories,

44:23.320 --> 44:25.280
the sudden intake of rich food

44:25.320 --> 44:28.040
appears to have solved another of the men's problems.

44:28.080 --> 44:32.360
Dan, how were your ablutions this afternoon?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.080
Danny had a trump and a fall of food, didn't he?

44:35.120 --> 44:37.800
He shit himself this afternoon while he was making his bed.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.800
It's dribbling down my legs.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.800
Just a little bit.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.440
A little bit of boo came out.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.720
I had to squeeze my socks out.

44:42.760 --> 44:43.720
Who's that by the way?

44:43.760 --> 44:44.720
Oh, God.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.360
Well, you fucking arsed, didn't you?

44:48.360 --> 44:51.400
Crocodile broth this evening.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.280
It's going to be superb.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.320
Come on, boys, dig in, please.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
Pass it round.

44:58.880 --> 44:59.880
How is it, Vic?

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
Oh, it's strong.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.040
I think strong is a good word.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.280
There is some distinct smell of poo about this.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.840
It smells a bit like dog shit, doesn't it?

45:07.880 --> 45:09.600
It does smell a bit suspicious, doesn't it?

45:09.640 --> 45:10.600
Yeah.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.600
Shit.

45:11.640 --> 45:12.920
Oh, crikey.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.440
Phil, what's the verdict?

45:14.480 --> 45:17.360
I've had two mouthfuls and that's two mouthfuls too many.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.840
I can feel the squirts coming on.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.200
The 30-degree tropical heat

45:22.240 --> 45:23.160
is making the food smell.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.320
The meat has spoiled the remains of the crocodile,

45:26.360 --> 45:30.320
leaving the men, once again, with nothing to eat.

45:30.360 --> 45:33.680
The final meal of my croc, it was basically rotten meat.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.120
It was pretty...

45:36.360 --> 45:37.360
Like it?

45:38.880 --> 45:40.960
I don't want to think about it too much.

45:42.360 --> 45:45.400
It was pretty much the worst thing I've ever had in my life.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.080
Oh. Oh, dear.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.520
Oh!

45:50.560 --> 45:51.840
Mind your shoulder, Piers.

45:51.880 --> 45:52.760
Yeah?

45:54.160 --> 45:58.160
Well, tonight marked the end of our crocodile feast.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.600
From now on, we've got no more meat to eat.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.800
Now that crocodile has dried up,

46:02.840 --> 46:05.200
we need another source of food in Highland.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.440
Oh, my God! What's that?

46:07.480 --> 46:09.560
Is that Andrew? Oh, my God!

46:09.600 --> 46:11.240
Next time on The Women's Island...

46:11.280 --> 46:12.600
Oh, my God.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.120
Oh, my God!

46:14.160 --> 46:15.840
..thoughts turn to food.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.640
I think a boogie just came out of my nose.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.320
Eat it, it's worth nothing!

46:19.360 --> 46:21.920
Oh, my God, there's two piglets!

46:21.960 --> 46:23.160
The first thing I thought of was crocodile.

46:23.160 --> 46:24.760
I thought it was me Force Quackling.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.760
.

46:32.840 --> 46:41.160
.

46:41.200 --> 46:47.480
.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.800
.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.920
.

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
.

46:52.000 --> 46:52.920
.
