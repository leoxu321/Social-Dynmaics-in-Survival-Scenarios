1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Two uninhabited Pacific Islands, more than 5,000 miles from the UK.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,280
One will be inhabited by 14 British men, while a separate island will be home to 14 British

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
women.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:30,120
When pushed to the limits of human endurance, will it be brute power or mental strength

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
that wins the day?

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,280
Who will have what it takes to stay alive?

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,000
Tonight, we follow the women.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,400
In 21st century Britain, old-fashioned ideas about men and women have disappeared, and

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,260
traditional gender roles have disappeared.

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,260
Women are often expected to do it all, combining childcare with excelling at work.

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,120
Don't let that happen again, I don't know who's doing it, it's really, really embarrassing

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
and unprofessional.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,080
But if stripped of all of the advantages of modern life, are multitasking 21st century

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,600
women better cut out for survival than men?

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,000
To find out, I'm abandoning 14 ordinary women to fend for themselves on a remote desert

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,500
island.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:33,120
They will be utterly alone.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Filming everything themselves.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Right, you're filming me, filming you.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
That is the biggest shark I've ever seen.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
They'll have to hunt for food...

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
You're all right, you are.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
..for water...

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Yeah, it's collecting water now.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
..and for shelter.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Oh, for f***'s sake.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,120
The women will be taken to the very edge of existence...

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Ah!

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
..living on the island for six weeks

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,120
in the middle of tropical storm season.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
It's like a tornado.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
That is terrifying.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
We need a radio and medic now.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
It's not a programme, it's just f***ing ridiculous.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
And leave it there.

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
When pitted against the extremes of nature...

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,120
..have these Monday women got what it takes to survive.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Guys!

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
That is a big f***.

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
People hold a lot of their self-worth in things like money,

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
what they're able to buy, what car they have,

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
what clothes they have, make-up, how beautiful they are.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
When all of that's gone on the island,

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I think it all comes down to what sort of a person you are.

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
I think you can be slightly different.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
You can be slightly mental to want to do this, right?

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I think you've got to be slightly off your tree.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
As human beings, it's the closest we're going to come to a reboot.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm about to abandon 14 British women

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,120
on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island.

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
I want my daughter to know that her mum is actually quite brave

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
and she's not just this person that's there to make tea.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
I want to show her that you can do anything.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm really looking forward to going back to the hunter-gatherer,

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
our animalistic roots,

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
and finding your own food.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I think it's only by pushing yourself to these extremes

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
that you get to find out who you truly are.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
These are ordinary women

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
with no previous experience of surviving in the wild.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm not going on because I can kill an animal

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,120
and I know I can survive and I can chop down trees.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm doing this because I can't.

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
But I'm eager to see if I can.

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
It's the adventure.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
There's so much I haven't seen.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
There's so much I haven't done.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm running out of time.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
And I might be running out of health.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
How fast are we going right now?

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
About 30 knots.

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
We can go really fast if you want.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I think people often think that to be good at adventure or survival,

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
you've got to have big muscles.

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
But actually, in the battle to stay alive,

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
it's one in here and in here, not on these.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Currently on the island,

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
all of us girls,

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I think we will not only survive,

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
but I think we'll thrive.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
This is your island.

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Straight ahead.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
There's no beach!

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,120
There are a lot of currents around this, OK?

86
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
So I'm going to try and find little areas of slack water

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
to get you in.

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Unpredictable riptides and hidden rocks

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
make these waters treacherous.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
This is the closest I can get the boat to the shoreline.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm not going to sugarcoat this for you guys.

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
It is going to be hard.

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
It's going to be hard physically.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
It's going to be hard emotionally.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
And the thing to remember is positivity,

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
positivity, positivity.

97
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,120
It's not the white beaches and the sun that we were daydreaming of.

98
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
I was OK until I got to this point,

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
and now I'm really panicking.

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Hey!

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
How deep is that?

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
You know, it is going to be out of your depth.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
There are rocks in there.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Just be smart.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
To get to the island,

106
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
the women have no choice but to swim to the shore

107
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
in the clothes they're wearing.

108
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
It's the thought of being all night

109
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
with no dry clothes and no fire,

110
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
cos we have to make mistakes.

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Don't think about it.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Don't think about it.

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Just one by one.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
It's going to take hours.

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
We'll just cuddle each other tonight.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Yeah.

117
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Everyone's allowed the old wind.

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Once we get you in the water,

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
you'll be done with it.

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Yeah.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Yeah?

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Then it's all in front of you.

123
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
It's all uphill from here.

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
You'll be great.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
You'll be great.

126
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
It's all uphill from here.

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Yeah.

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
You're good to go.

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Let's go for it.

130
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
The women take with them bags and cases

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
containing their filming equipment

132
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
and medical supplies.

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
This is croc territory.

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Let's get you out of the water as fast as we can.

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
OK, let's go.

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,120
From this moment on, they'll be completely alone.

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Who are you?

138
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
George.

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
George. Excellent.

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Becky.

141
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Becky. Hi, Becky.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Happy.

143
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Ah!

144
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
It's so nice to meet you.

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm Harveller.

146
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Nice to meet you.

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
What do you do?

148
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm a psychotherapist.

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Oh, my God!

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Yeah!

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Belinda.

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm Jamie.

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Jamie.

154
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Nice to meet you.

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
What's your name?

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Ah, Becky.

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Hello.

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Belinda.

159
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Well, that was suitably chaotic.

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
You know, it's 4 o'clock.

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
It's going to get dark here in a couple of hours.

162
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
And already, you know, there have been 15 minutes

163
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
of chat, chat, chat on the beach.

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
They need to work hard, get moving.

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
But, yeah.

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
It's so nice to meet you.

167
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Thank you.

168
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Thank you.

169
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Thank you.

170
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Thank you.

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Thank you.

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Thank you.

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
But, yeah.

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
There's nothing I can do.

175
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
These are things they're going to find out.

176
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,120
It's time for me and the crew to leave.

177
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,120
We won't be back till the end of the experiment.

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh!

179
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
I am peeing!

180
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm peeing!

181
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm peeing!

182
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I'm peeing!

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh!

184
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
I still need to pee.

185
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't know if I want to pee through my trousers.

186
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, boy.

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
I don't know.

188
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Drop them.

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
The women's home for the next six weeks

190
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,120
is this remote, uninhabited beach.

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,580
Pacific Island. To make sure they have a fighting chance of survival, I've ensured

192
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,040
there is enough water, indigenous animals and vegetation to keep them alive. But

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,440
only if they have the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it. I've dropped the

194
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,060
group in the most inhospitable part of the island. There's unforgiving jungle and

195
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,620
deadly creatures all around. Now just two hours before sunset, the group need to

196
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,180
move away as quickly as they can. Are you still weeing, Jade? I'm weeing. I need to find that peaceful moment where I can actually weee.

197
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,020
The thing is I'm weeing. And then I push more and I'm weeing more. I think it's because I've held it in for so long.

198
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:39,620
Guys, it's really dense up here so we need to get moving. We're just gonna try and take all the kit up this slope basically.

199
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Bring it up because I think the tide's coming in and then try and find some way to fucking sleep.

200
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
Can you take this camera of course?

201
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
All of the women will be filming.

202
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,620
But four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.

203
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,620
They'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.

204
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Please, could you just push me at my back? No, it's my weight. I can't get it up.

205
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Here. Wait. That's it. That's what I needed.

206
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,620
The women have no food and just one day's supply of drinking water.

207
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,620
We need a decent place to sleep tonight because it's nearly dark.

208
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,620
We're not gonna have it here. We actually need to go. We really do.

209
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
All right, who wants to carve the way?

210
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:28,620
To stand any chance of surviving, they've been provided with three knives, three machetes and some basic fishing equipment.

211
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,620
Anybody that's using a knife, just tell us. Don't whack it out.

212
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Guys, are we going right or straight?

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Guys, should we get together and have a chat?

214
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Well, let's ask her.

215
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Shall we come up? There's a clearing.

216
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,620
With little daylight left, the group's priority must be to find a safe place to camp and quickly.

217
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,620
We can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.

218
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
100%. 100%.

219
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Do you want to lead the way? Make a decision. You lead the way.

220
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Anywhere you think looks the clearest, we'll follow you.

221
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,620
I'm not going that way, right? It's more dense and the light is through over here, so I want to go over here.

222
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Guys, be really careful when you come in on this trail.

223
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm still going up.

224
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Keep going. Keep going.

225
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Need to get the fuck out.

226
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
What?

227
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
Oh!

228
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Stay still. We've got dinner.

229
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Oh, my God.

230
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
What is it?

231
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Snake.

232
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
It's right near me.

233
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
A huge fucking snake came towards me.

234
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
It's fine.

235
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
I think what you need to do...

236
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Fucking hell.

237
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,620
Right, it's going up the tree, girls.

238
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Shall I just chop its head off?

239
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,620
It came right at me.

240
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
What? What, its head?

241
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
And it came straight towards me.

242
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
And then we stood on it.

243
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
That's why I ran away.

244
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
Oh, fuck.

245
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm going to fucking die on this island.

246
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
You're not going to die. You are not going to die.

247
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
It came right towards me like that.

248
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Just breathe slowly and walk up to me now.

249
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
How am I going to sleep in this island?

250
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Come on. What's her name?

251
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Jamie.

252
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Jamie, come to me.

253
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
Oh, my God.

254
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Just come to me.

255
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Right, I'll come to you.

256
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
To be honest, I'm frightened of everything.

257
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Bogs and snakes and crocodiles and sharks.

258
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,620
But I really, really want to overcome the fear.

259
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Materialistic things really shouldn't matter.

260
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,620
But, unfortunately, they do matter a lot to me.

261
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,620
I can't imagine what it's going to be like

262
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,620
going back to complete and utter basics.

263
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,620
It might change me into a new woman completely.

264
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
I have no idea.

265
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Oh, I was on an island for two minutes

266
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
and a snake attacked me. Fuck me.

267
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
I don't want a snake coming towards me.

268
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Take a deep breath, please.

269
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
OK.

270
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
Just in.

271
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Just stand still.

272
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
And breathe in.

273
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Right.

274
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
And breathe out.

275
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
It's not going to get you.

276
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
It looks like it's bloody coming.

277
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,620
It's bloody not. Stop fucking looking for it.

278
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,620
So, basically, the whole place is crawling with snakes.

279
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Go on. Move on.

280
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Keep moving.

281
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
I want to get out of here.

282
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,620
When you're pushing through dense jungle into the unknown,

283
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
everything is a potential threat.

284
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
You've got caiman crocodiles, you've got snakes,

285
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,620
you've got wild pigs,

286
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,620
all of which are most likely to attack when they're surprised.

287
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
You let your guard down,

288
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,620
the wild is going to bite you on the backside hard.

289
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
I feel like everything's crawling on me.

290
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,620
It's not.

291
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
You've got to try and just take your mind away

292
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
and just pretend you're walking through some lovely area

293
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
of a botanical garden.

294
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
Oh, shit, there's a yucca.

295
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Oh, wow.

296
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,620
Right in front of us.

297
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Look.

298
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Look.

299
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
We've got a yucca.

300
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Guys, we need to get our priorities straight.

301
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
It's an early win.

302
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,620
They've identified a valuable source of carbohydrate.

303
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
We're getting too excited about yucca.

304
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm actually quite concerned about sleeping not yucca.

305
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
This is nuts.

306
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,620
I didn't know places like this existed.

307
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh, my hair.

308
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
It's caught on fire.

309
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,620
I hear more spikes.

310
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,620
Guys, there's spikes on this that you can't even see.

311
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,620
We're getting denser.

312
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Is everybody happy to continue through this?

313
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Well, um...

314
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,620
I think we need to think about how much sunlight we have left.

315
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,620
If I have to, I'll walk through the dark

316
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,620
because I am not sleeping here because of that snake.

317
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm with you on that one.

318
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,620
I don't know what else is here.

319
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,620
With light running out fast,

320
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,620
the women are no closer to finding a beach to set up camp.

321
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Guys, where we just stopped, where there is quite a big open space,

322
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
this might be a good place to just base.

323
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Let's do it.

324
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Right.

325
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,620
I really, really do feel like I want to get out of this area

326
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,620
because I feel like we've made absolutely zero progress.

327
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Let's get out of here.

328
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,620
It's really making me quite anxious and stressing me out.

329
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,620
14 British women have been abandoned on a remote Pacific island

330
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,620
with nothing but the closest stand-up in and a few basic tools.

331
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Sorry, tree.

332
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
What I want to find out is,

333
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,620
has all of this cushioning that civilisation has experienced,

334
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,620
has it made us totally lose touch with that survival instinct

335
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,620
that I believe is deep within us all?

336
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
OK.

337
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
With night closing in,

338
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,620
the women have decided to abandon their search for a beach

339
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
and set up camp in the jungle,

340
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,620
taking their chances with the deadly critters.

341
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Strength is the key.

342
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Strength isn't an outward thing.

343
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,620
It's an inner thing.

344
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
It's an inner quality.

345
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
And whether you're a man or a woman, you can have that.

346
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,620
It's about how you react to the hardship.

347
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,620
Ring, ring, go away, come again

348
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
When we get off there sailing

349
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Just got changed and now it's raining.

350
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Oh, yeah?

351
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I've only got me normal pants.

352
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
If the women are to survive,

353
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,620
they'll need to live through six weeks of the tropical storm season.

354
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
At its worst,

355
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,620
the torrential rain can dump up to an inch of water in an hour.

356
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,620
My current knickers and trousers are wet through,

357
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,620
so I feel like I've wet myself a bit.

358
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I've been wearing a shitty nappy.

359
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,620
I have dry socks, though, which are in my bra.

360
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Keeping it even drier.

361
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Yeah, that's a good idea.

362
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Without shelter, the only protection the women have from the elements

363
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
is their raincoats and ponchos.

364
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
It's absolutely hideous.

365
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
It's going to get dark soon.

366
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,620
And that will mean that there's no heat at all.

367
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,620
So we will go to bed cold and damp,

368
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,620
and we'll have to sleep on a cold and damp jungle floor.

369
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:03,620
I've got my fucking hands in my hairdresser.

370
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,620
And, like, I can't afford this.

371
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Do you want to see the water coming out of my socks on film?

372
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Don't worry.

373
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,620
7pm, and the women are determined to get a fire started.

374
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,620
If you can find another tree with some of that, great.

375
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
But that will burn very, very quickly.

376
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,620
It's cold and it's horrible.

377
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
I'm trying to actually not even think about it.

378
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
That's what I'm trying to do at the moment,

379
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,620
just focus on what's going on and not focus about the dark.

380
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Because if we don't get a fire and we sit down, awful.

381
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
After just two days' survival training,

382
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Becky, Georgina and their team have made a bow and drill.

383
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,620
And we move this really slow and low, Becky.

384
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
I like it long and I like it slow.

385
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Spinning one piece at a time.

386
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,620
One piece of wood against another should create enough friction

387
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
to produce a burning ember.

388
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Honestly, who'd be a bloody caveman?

389
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
We've done it once, we'll do it again.

390
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
We can do this, girls. We can do it.

391
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,620
We're all so desperate to make fire

392
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,620
and the conditions are just so wet.

393
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,620
I just have a feeling we're going to stay up all night

394
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
and try and make fire.

395
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Any smoke?

396
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,620
How long do you think the girls have been at it now?

397
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Three hours, maybe more than three hours.

398
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,620
These women I'm with are amazing.

399
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,620
I've gone from absolutely terrified

400
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,620
to sheer thrill and enjoyment.

401
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Oh, there's tons of smoke.

402
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,620
It's like a frigging wigwam.

403
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Keep going.

404
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
I don't think I can hold it much longer.

405
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Ah!

406
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Bloody good ember.

407
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,620
We're going for it.

408
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Maybe it's going too far on that one.

409
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Yes.

410
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
You're very nearly there.

411
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
Here we go!

412
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Oh, my God!

413
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Wow!

414
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Do it again, just a little bit more.

415
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Oh, my God!

416
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Oh, my God!

417
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Us women just like to do this by persistence,

418
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
persistence, persistence.

419
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Yeah.

420
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Becky and her team's determination has paid off.

421
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Not even a little fire.

422
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
A fucking giant one.

423
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
After just five hours of trying,

424
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,620
these women have achieved what took mankind

425
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,620
hundreds of thousands of years.

426
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Guys, how are we actually feeling about the fire?

427
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
But almost more importantly, what it does for the women

428
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,620
is going to give them a sense that they're gaining control

429
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
of their environment.

430
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,620
Is everyone stripping off?

431
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,620
She's got my dress stuck in my knickers.

432
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
I don't want to sound too cocky too early.

433
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,620
No, I don't think we should.

434
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
I don't think we should at all.

435
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,620
But right now, this is...

436
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,620
We're winning.

437
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Oh!

438
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

439
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Fucking fuck me!

440
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
What the fuck is that?

441
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
What is it?

442
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
Please tell me that's not a spider.

443
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
What is it?

444
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,620
It's that big crab over there.

445
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Can you see it, Jo?

446
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Oh, my God, there's no way I can sleep here.

447
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Fucking hell!

448
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
We're not staying here tomorrow.

449
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
We're all going together, and we're going that way,

450
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
and we're not going to stop until we find a flaming beach.

451
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Oh, no.

452
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,620
Lady's got crabs.

453
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
The women have had a restless first night

454
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
on the damp jungle floor.

455
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,620
I tried to have some sleep,

456
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
but the noises in the night

457
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
and the crabs that were creeping up on us,

458
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
I just couldn't...

459
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
I just sat up all the time with the torch,

460
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
the head torch, like that.

461
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I did. I woke everybody up with my fart.

462
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,620
You did about five or six big, loud ones.

463
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Yeah, well, no, no, no, they weren't loud.

464
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Oh, no.

465
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
You just decided to sleep at our party.

466
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Walk me up.

467
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
This is that...

468
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
It's a yucca,

469
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
and it's a bit like a potato.

470
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Despite lack of sleep, Julie's playing mum

471
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,620
and has rustled up a little breakfast.

472
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,620
I'm very excited. We've got our first foods.

473
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Oh, hang on.

474
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Oh, my God.

475
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
Not as nice as normal food.

476
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,620
When we're actually starving, it'll be absolutely amazing.

477
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,620
The group may have found food.

478
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Add to the collection.

479
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
What's that?

480
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Oh, it's swollen.

481
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,620
But during the night, it's the women themselves

482
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,620
that are featured on the island menu.

483
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Look at my back.

484
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,620
I've got, like, a full face of spots,

485
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
and I can't even, like, wipe my eyes,

486
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
because my hands are dirty.

487
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,620
Look at my nails.

488
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Basically, I cannot be dealing with this.

489
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,620
One side of me is like, I want to do this, I love nature,

490
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
I am one with nature,

491
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,620
and the other side of me is just like, look at my fucking face.

492
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Are you kidding me?

493
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
You know, what the fuck, right?

494
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
You always look gorgeous when you're young.

495
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
You do.

496
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Don't be.

497
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
I think so.

498
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
No.

499
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
We're all young.

500
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Do you know what?

501
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Your boobs are better than mine.

502
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Well, mine are false.

503
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
The urgent priority for the group

504
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
is to find a safe place to camp,

505
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
away from the jungle creatures

506
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
and near a sustainable water source.

507
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
There's only going to be, what, like, 20 litres of water,

508
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,620
and that's not lasting us 14 people for very long.

509
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
As nice as this camp is, we want to...

510
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
I am trying to be nice.

511
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Go and find the beach.

512
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,620
So, one group's going to go look,

513
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
and one group's going to stay here.

514
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
Who's in the go group?

515
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
Can I come?

516
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,620
Yeah.

517
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Have you got your whistles?

518
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
Yes, we've whistled us.

519
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
Hold on a minute.

520
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,620
You think that you can walk right round this island in the water?

521
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
We don't know.

522
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
I don't know.

523
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
It's trial and error, isn't it?

524
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
I don't think so.

525
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,620
I think this decision has been made a little too quickly,

526
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
and I just think we need to plan.

527
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
Why don't we just stay here

528
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
for another few hours thinking about it?

529
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Or we could go.

530
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Are you not coming now?

531
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,620
Yeah, I am.

532
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
Off your butt, then.

533
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
We're off.

534
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
I've done the children.

535
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
I've been mum.

536
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
I've done my business.

537
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,620
I'm at this age now where I need to do something for me.

538
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,620
For me, when I was younger, I did want to do certain things,

539
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
but I never had actually either the balls or the friends

540
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,620
to do it with me,

541
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,620
and I didn't have enough balls to do it on my own.

542
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,620
And now I want to see if I can cope.

543
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,620
So do you see if we go to the end of that bit there

544
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
and see what's around the corner?

545
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
I wish I had water with me.

546
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
With nothing to carry it in,

547
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,620
Abi and Fran's group set off with no water.

548
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,620
I'm really hoping to find a beach,

549
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
because last night was not good.

550
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Because last night was not fun.

551
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,620
My body does not like this at all.

552
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,620
I hope there's paradise beyond these rocks.

553
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Finding a good camp is a key priority.

554
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,620
They'll need a base with vital resources close at hand,

555
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
the sea for food,

556
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
the materials to build a shelter,

557
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
and a plentiful water source.

558
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Let that be a beach, please.

559
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Oh, my God, it's grim.

560
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
I have a feeling when the tide is high,

561
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
that disappears.

562
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,620
What, the whole of that?

563
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,620
I agree.

564
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
And that's a mangrove there.

565
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Yeah.

566
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
This whole thing's been futile round this side, then.

567
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
This is shit.

568
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
What do you want to do?

569
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I need to have a drink.

570
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,620
So we have a good trek to get back to drink town.

571
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
I'm, like, shattered.

572
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,620
We can't let this island take its toll on us on the second day.

573
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
It's hot. We don't have water.

574
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Just even trekking is a risk right now.

575
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
The women have left themselves exposed

576
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,620
in oppressive 30-degree heat with nothing to drink.

577
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
I'm sick.

578
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,620
I'm going to have to sit down in a minute.

579
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
I'm going to collapse.

580
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,620
It's a long way back to their temporary camp.

581
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Guys, we've had a fall.

582
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Oh, fuck.

583
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
OK, don't panic.

584
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Shit, no, don't. Are you all right?

585
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Oh, shit, no, wait.

586
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Sit forward. Sit forward.

587
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
You've got to sit forward.

588
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
OK, here we go.

589
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Put your head down low. Low, low, low, low, low.

590
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
Don't let your head burn.

591
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm so sorry. I know.

592
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Would you stop apologising?

593
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
In temperatures like this,

594
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
the women have got to drink a lot,

595
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,620
between two and four litres of water a day.

596
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
If they don't, they're finished.

597
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
Come on, friend.

598
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Let's do a little walk.

599
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,620
My parents were Iranian, like, very protective,

600
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,620
and I have literally lived such a sheltered life.

601
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,620
All of the decisions in my life have been made for me.

602
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,620
All they ever see is just study and get married.

603
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I want to prove that I can be independent,

604
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,620
that I can survive and that I can make decisions for myself.

605
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Yeah, go back, get a drink.

606
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
That's it. I just feel like I'm on a bomb.

607
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,620
I actually just thought we'd find some idyllic beach within 24 hours,

608
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,620
but actually, the reality is we're actually only something like,

609
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,620
oh, God, a few hundred metres away from where we jumped out the stupid boat.

610
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
So, right now, I feel a bit of a failure.

611
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,620
I can't believe we can't get out of here.

612
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,620
The whole notion of surviving on a tropical island may sound idyllic,

613
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,620
but the reality behind the picture postcard fantasy is brutal.

614
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
It may look like paradise,

615
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,620
but trying to survive on an island like that really can be hell on earth.

616
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,620
I've been trying to keep these tears in all along.

617
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Stop it, Jade. Just try and stop.

618
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,620
Just try and stop, cos it'll make you feel worse by crying.

619
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
That's my friend.

620
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,620
It's not great, I'm not gonna lie.

621
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Day three on the island.

622
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,620
The women have been forced to spend another night of misery in the jungle

623
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,620
after failing to find a safe place to camp with a water source.

624
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Everybody just needs to find that bloody beach,

625
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
cos I'm not staying here again tonight.

626
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
No way.

627
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Stop with the tears, because it isn't going to do anything.

628
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
It's not going to change anything.

629
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,620
I think Jade's really struggling with just getting used to...

630
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,620
..like, island life, as we all are.

631
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,620
I know that sounds really harsh, and I'm not being a bastard,

632
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
I'm trying not to be, but...

633
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
No, it's the truth, yeah.

634
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,620
I sometimes, with my children, have to just say,

635
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,620
''Shut up.'' Do you know what I mean? To pull them round.

636
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Can't you channel your anger through somewhere else?

637
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Yeah, I'm angry with Bear Grylls.

638
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Go with that thought. Yes.

639
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Just go with that thought.

640
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Yeah, I'm really angry with Bear Grylls.

641
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,620
More desperate than ever to get out of the jungle,

642
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,620
the women are sending out another search party to find a beach camp.

643
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Can we form a circle or something, so we can have a chat?

644
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,620
But before they leave, Jade has an announcement to make.

645
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,620
I am not prepared for something like this.

646
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,620
I'm really, really glad that I've come here,

647
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,620
but I don't want to continue.

648
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
That's perfectly fair.

649
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
What is it that's tipped you over the edge,

650
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,620
that you just can't cope with any more?

651
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Everything's wet, even my socks are wet, my shoes are wet.

652
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
I've got bites all over my hand on my face,

653
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,620
and, yeah, they go in, and they might not look as bad.

654
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
Did you not think that was always going to happen, though,

655
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
that we were going to get bitten and we were going to get wet?

656
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,620
You're wet and you're cold and you're this and you'll go back...

657
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
And I'm ill. I'm unwell. And you'll have food.

658
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
I'm unwell. I've been bitten to shit, I'm unwell,

659
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,620
and my health comes first, and...

660
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
If we found the beach today,

661
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
and if we did find the glorious beach

662
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,620
that there is,

663
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
then things could be so different.

664
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
I don't know what to say.

665
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
I know I can see.

666
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,620
I don't want to, yeah, and that's all honesty.

667
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Put my hands up, you know.

668
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Put my shriveled, hanging nail,

669
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
bitten hands up.

670
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Jade, I'm really enjoying the experience,

671
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,620
but I don't like that I've been bitten on my face.

672
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
I look like shit. I'm just looking at myself,

673
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
and I look like shit.

674
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
I'm just kind of a bit over it,

675
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
and it's like, you know, if you don't want to be here,

676
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,620
you don't want to be on the edge, fuck off.

677
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
Unable to persuade Jade to stay...

678
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Foxtrot to Bravo.

679
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,620
..the women have no choice but to use their emergency sat phone

680
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,620
to request her evacuation from the island.

681
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,620
I know this is total bitching, but I'm just going to be honest.

682
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:27,620
She comes across really unintelligent.

683
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,620
She is not intelligent enough to actually realise

684
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
what she was getting herself into.

685
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Coming on the island.

686
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Bye, love. I can't get up. I've got nothing on my feet.

687
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,620
After less than 48 hours on the island,

688
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,620
hairdresser Jade is making her way to meet the boat

689
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,620
that will take her back to civilisation.

690
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,620
What's the point of me waxing my bikini?

691
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
I haven't even shown my legs yet.

692
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
The truth is, for the women on this island,

693
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
every single one of them will have a low point.

694
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
It is just a nature of survival.

695
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,620
No! No!

696
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,620
This is all about seeing who, in those moments,

697
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
who rises and who crumbles.

698
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Right, everyone take a whistle. Thank you.

699
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,620
The women urgently need to get their search for a camp under way

700
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,620
and find a permanent water source.

701
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,620
Their original supply of drinking water has run out.

702
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,620
All they have now is one muddy puddle.

703
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
We've gone that way.

704
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
The one direction we haven't gone is that way.

705
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
Yeah, that's where we are, thank you.

706
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,620
This time, 58-year-old Forrester's daughter Fee

707
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,620
will lead the expedition party's hunt for a beach.

708
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,620
I'm used to being in forests,

709
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
and I'm not going to be really happy

710
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
if people start telling me I'm going the wrong way.

711
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,620
The most important thing is that we go, and we go in a straight line.

712
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,620
Seven women volunteer to join Fee on the trek,

713
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
including furniture maker Kate.

714
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
She's got the sense of direction.

715
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
I'm following her.

716
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Abi, Fran and three others stay behind in their temporary camp

717
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
to keep the vital fire alight.

718
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
We will come back with a beach.

719
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
Please do.

720
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Go on, move on.

721
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Fee's plan is to cut right through the dense jungle interior

722
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
to the opposite side of the island.

723
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
This is not a decent route.

724
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
It's full of veins and everything.

725
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
We're in a jungle.

726
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
I know.

727
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Splitting up your group is a high risk.

728
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,620
But if you do decide to send out an advance party...

729
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Preparation, preparation, preparation.

730
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,620
It really is fundamental to good survival.

731
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,620
..and you've got to prepare for any eventuality.

732
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,620
One small mistake can quickly spiral out of control.

733
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I've got our group water where we can keep hydrated.

734
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
With rations restricted,

735
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,620
they've only brought two litres with them in improvised bamboo cups.

736
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,620
In this heat,

737
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,620
that's likely to last less than an hour.

738
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
I love it. I actually think that's really tasty.

739
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
It is nice, isn't it?

740
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
I think the bamboo flavours it.

741
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,620
In the last nine or ten years,

742
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,620
I've been made redundant four times.

743
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,620
I went from being this high-flying career woman to nothing.

744
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,620
I don't think the children have anything about me

745
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
that they would talk to their friends about.

746
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
You know, Daddy designs roads for a living.

747
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
I don't think there's anything...

748
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
..that makes me amazing to them.

749
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
I have to finish it and have to do it

750
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
and make my children proud of me.

751
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Fee? What?

752
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,620
What about that way? That's downhill.

753
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
And there's lots of sunlight, which means...

754
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,620
No, we've had lots of matches with lots of sunlight.

755
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
What we need to do is get up here.

756
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Fuck!

757
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
George, I'm just going to forge ahead.

758
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
She's going through anything.

759
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Doesn't matter what it is, Fee's going to go through it.

760
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
She's on her mission.

761
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
George.

762
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,620
George, I have no idea if this is going to work.

763
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,620
Who gives a fuck? At least we're trying.

764
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Fee's expedition party are now deep in the island's jungle interior.

765
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
What?

766
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,620
I've ripped my trousers even more.

767
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,620
I couldn't get any more ripped.

768
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Fluids are running dangerously low

769
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
and they still have no idea how far they are

770
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
from a beach or a water source.

771
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,620
They're just losing so much water.

772
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,620
In unrelenting 34-degree heat,

773
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,620
the group are now sweating a litre of water an hour.

774
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,620
The more we're sweating, the more we're losing, aren't we?

775
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Is that us running out of water now?

776
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Yep. Yeah.

777
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,620
Oh, dear.

778
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,620
We've run out of water, which is pretty stupid, actually, I think.

779
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
God, this is nuts.

780
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Lost and adrift in the jungle interior,

781
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
the women have no idea what they're doing.

782
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,620
The women have no idea when they'll find their next drink.

783
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,620
It's hard work. It's just draining.

784
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Yeah. It's like being in a spider's web.

785
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Is there any way to get fucking through?

786
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
This is looking better.

787
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
Wow. Look at that.

788
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Sky!

789
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
I can smell the sea.

790
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Fuck!

791
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,620
If we get there, can we have a celebratory swim?

792
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
I'm not wearing any pants.

793
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Do I just have to go for the full-on mask?

794
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Yeah.

795
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
I don't want to.

796
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Whoa!

797
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
I can feel it.

798
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Yeah, it's here.

799
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
Whoa!

800
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,620
I can see a fucking palm tree.

801
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Whoo!

802
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Unless I'm delusional, that is the decking sea woman.

803
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
This is for us.

804
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Guys, we found it!

805
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Is there a beach?

806
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
Yes!

807
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Oh, God.

808
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
Whoo!

809
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,620
Look at this.

810
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Oh, my God.

811
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
I feel like I'm going to cry.

812
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Oh, my God, it's being sunk!

813
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Yes!

814
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Whoo!

815
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,620
God, God!

816
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Amazing.

817
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
Yes!

818
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Whoo!

819
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Whoo!

820
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,620
Oh, my God!

821
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
It's like a mountain.

822
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Whoo!

823
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,620
Although, really?

824
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Did you ever think we would make it?

825
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
I honestly didn't.

826
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
We did it!

827
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
I know I'm going to cry.

828
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,620
Come on.

829
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Oh!

830
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
This is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen.

831
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:20,620
And you know, if it was the most disgusting beach, this would still be the most beautiful

832
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
achievement, because that in there is horrific.

833
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
We're going swimming now.

834
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,620
in that cool Pacific water.

835
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
WHISTLE BLOWS

836
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
With the discovery of the beach

837
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
comes a lifeline for the women.

838
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Honestly, I feel so dehydrated.

839
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,620
Basically, my mouth was feeling like Gandhi's flip-flop.

840
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
No energy.

841
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
We can clean our teeth...

842
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
..and we can comb our hair.

843
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
And I found some flip-flops.

844
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,620
The expedition party have discovered a beach,

845
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,620
but they're yet to find a permanent water source.

846
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
It looks like it might rain.

847
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,620
So, we're going to...

848
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,620
We might actually be showered all night tonight.

849
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
Shit.

850
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Going down dark, we have no water.

851
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
We have no fire.

852
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
The sand flies everywhere.

853
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,620
So, you know, there is potential for it to be amazing,

854
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
but right now I'm just thinking,

855
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,620
oh, my God, how are we going to get through the night?

856
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,620
With night drawing in, the women have no choice but to sleep here

857
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
and return to collect the others in the morning.

858
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
I can actually smell myself.

859
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Yeah.

860
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
I completely hum.

861
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,620
Yeah.

862
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
My armpits smell.

863
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
The worst thing is our feet.

864
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Yeah.

865
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
With no shelter,

866
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,620
the group will have to take their chances with the elements.

867
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
And the frustrating thing for me is,

868
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
we all bloody knew to go be prepared.

869
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Oh, my God.

870
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,620
3am and the heavens have opened.

871
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Shivering, freezing cold.

872
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I don't like this.

873
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
The women's expedition party

874
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
discovered a beach to base their camp,

875
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,620
but haven't yet found the key to their survival,

876
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
a sustainable water source.

877
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,620
We had a dunder about, well,

878
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
all the palm ponds that we found for our bed.

879
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,620
They're soaked through, stranded and dehydrated.

880
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,620
What the good thing is about getting this wet

881
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
is that we can wring out our shirts and suck them,

882
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,620
and I'm really not joking.

883
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,620
At the minute, we are barely coping with the situation

884
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
in which we find ourselves.

885
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Barely.

886
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
Barely.

887
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,620
I mean, hardly, actually.

888
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Barely.

889
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
Because we didn't prepare properly.

890
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
No.

891
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
That is the bottom line.

892
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
And now we're sitting in the fucking rain again.

893
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Incredible.

894
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,620
In the height of storm season,

895
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
the weather can literally change

896
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
in the blink of an eye.

897
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,620
You know, one minute you're going to have scorching sunshine,

898
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
the next, thunder, lightning, torrential rain.

899
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
And in these sort of extreme conditions,

900
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
even the thickest jungle canopy

901
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
is going to give you precious little protection.

902
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:31,380
7am. It's day four on the island.

903
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,620
At their temporary camp, the night of torrential rain

904
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,680
has also had a disastrous consequence for the five women left behind.

905
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,940
The fire went out last night because of the weather.

906
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,780
All the kind of wood and everything we need was wet,

907
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,600
so when we put it on the fire, it just made the fire die.

908
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,340
It's just gone out.

909
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,120
The situation is critical.

910
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,440
Without fire, the group have lost their only means

911
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,600
of purifying the water from the muddy puddle.

912
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,720
They're now down to capturing rainwater in Beth's poncho.

913
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,340
This is what we're resorting to now.

914
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,540
Roof water.

915
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,420
On the other side of the island,

916
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
the expedition party is also having to rely

917
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,240
on an alternative source of hydration.

918
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,540
I think all of these coconuts are making my bowels move a little bit.

919
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,380
So I'm going to have to go and look for somewhere to try and do a poo.

920
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,160
I may as well just do this.

921
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,880
I'm going to have to put that on.

922
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,040
Because I've got no fucking place.

923
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,100
The women set off along the beach, scouring the area,

924
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
looking for a sustainable water source.

925
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,240
We saw all those riverbeds,

926
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,940
and I reckon this is where one of them obviously comes out,

927
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,080
because we've got this massive drainage point

928
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,340
of all this fresh water.

929
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,880
Hang on.

930
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,860
Are my eyes deceiving me, or is that a huge water source?

931
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,500
It's slightly muddy, but it's not salty.

932
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,420
Yay!

933
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,820
We found water!

934
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,740
We just need to find a container now to boil it in, and fire.

935
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,240
The discovery of the water source means the women can use this beach

936
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,740
as their permanent base.

937
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,240
All right, let's get going.

938
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,540
But before they make a camp, they face a daunting trek

939
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,740
through the jungle to collect the others.

940
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,240
Have we got any water again now?

941
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
No, we've got nothing.

942
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Have we not got any water?

943
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Nothing. We've got nothing.

944
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,740
So we're going on this trek knowing that we're going to get

945
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,240
absolutely fucked and dehydrated.

946
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,740
Now, honestly, I have no idea if this is right,

947
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,040
but we've made a plan, so we've got to stick to it.

948
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,240
Navigating under...

949
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,240
thick jungle canopy is always going to be difficult.

950
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,240
It's going to be unpredictable, you don't get reference points,

951
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
you haven't got the sun to guide you,

952
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,240
and embarking on a journey like that in 30-degree heat

953
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,240
with no water, really, you're on borrowed time.

954
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,240
You need to do it like you mean it.

955
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Shall we show you?

956
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Brilliant.

957
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
The women are marking their path

958
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
to help find their way back to the beach on their return.

959
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,240
Found a period tree.

960
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
It's on its monthly right now.

961
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Let's go this way. It looks like there's a bit of a path.

962
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
I think we should be going more that way.

963
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Which way? No way.

964
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
No!

965
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
That's going back on ourselves.

966
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Exactly. We've just got to keep going this way, I'm afraid.

967
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
This is actually the opposite direction.

968
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
We're going back towards the beach.

969
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
What the fuck is this?

970
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,240
The expedition party are deep in the jungle interior

971
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
and have mistakenly headed north in the wrong direction

972
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
from their temporary camp,

973
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,240
now completely lost, they're doubling back on themselves.

974
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
You know, you have to ask yourself the reason they haven't come.

975
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
Do you think they're not coming?

976
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Well...

977
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
They've got to come back.

978
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,240
Abi and the others have been unable to relight their fire

979
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
and have run out of drinking water.

980
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,240
They are now desperate for the other women to return.

981
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm really fed up.

982
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, four days, 100 metres from home,

983
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,240
100 metres from being dropped off. It's crazy.

984
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,240
Which way do you think our current base is?

985
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Well, I think...

986
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
..it...

987
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Oh, fuck.

988
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm so confused, I don't know.

989
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,240
The expedition party remain lost and dangerously dehydrated.

990
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
What just happened there?

991
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,240
I was just calling so that hopefully the base camp

992
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,240
will be able to hear the hello and make a sound back.

993
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Hello!

994
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Listen.

995
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Hang on. Shush! Shush!

996
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Blow again. It was a one-whistle response.

997
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
Hello!

998
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Yeah, that way.

999
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
They definitely whistled.

1000
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I wouldn't be surprised if they couldn't find the whistle at the other camp

1001
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
and that's why they didn't reply.

1002
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Hello!

1003
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Fuck!

1004
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
That's the first bird.

1005
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
It's a minor bird.

1006
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
So is this fucking birds?

1007
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
I think it's birds, yeah.

1008
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Fucking birds!

1009
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
We got a bit prematurely excited.

1010
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Right, where the fuck do we go now?

1011
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Moving through jungle, you get wall after wall of dense undergrowth

1012
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
and what happens when everything looks the same,

1013
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
it's so easy to lose your bearings

1014
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
and then you get that rising sense of panic.

1015
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,240
That big tree there, it's got all my slash marks in it from the way we came.

1016
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I think you're getting really confused with the directions

1017
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,240
because if you go up that hill, that's where we just came from,

1018
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
except we came up from a beach there.

1019
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
We did not come from there, Fi,

1020
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,240
because I've been marking trees all along that route there.

1021
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,240
No, there's a much clearer way of saying it.

1022
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
The ocean...

1023
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
What I would say, Fi, at the moment, is that your way of saying it

1024
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
is that I'm right and everybody else is wrong.

1025
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
You're the one who's confident to say,

1026
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I've got a great sense of direction,

1027
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,240
but you're not taking anything from anybody else.

1028
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
There's another slash mark here.

1029
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
Oh, no.

1030
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
We have nothing to drink.

1031
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
We don't know where we are.

1032
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Let's do my din.

1033
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,240
I can't remember the time I felt this thirsty.

1034
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,240
How critical do you think our situation is now?

1035
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
I'm absolutely crapping my pants now.

1036
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
All I care about is water.

1037
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,240
That is all I care about, water.

1038
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
It's more than 24 hours since the expedition party

1039
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
left their temporary camp

1040
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
and are now further away than ever.

1041
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Back at base, the situation is critical, too.

1042
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Well, they're not coming for us today, are they?

1043
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Happy fucking Mondays.

1044
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,240
The women left behind are struggling to find dry wood

1045
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
to relight the fire, and without this,

1046
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,240
they can't purify the remaining water in the puddle,

1047
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
and they've barely eaten for four days.

1048
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Do you think we should start a fire?

1049
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
Yes.

1050
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Do you want to start clearing all that shite off the fire, Gran?

1051
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
I can't. My heart's beating like mad.

1052
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
So is everybody's, Gran.

1053
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
We're all in the same boat.

1054
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Fucking hell.

1055
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,240
Let's not be bitchy, please.

1056
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
People can manage and people can't,

1057
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,240
and we'll have our ups and downs, but let's not bitch.

1058
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
I'm sorry.

1059
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
No, come and sit here. Deep breaths and don't talk.

1060
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Just come and sit here.

1061
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Come and sit on the comfy chair.

1062
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
And sit there.

1063
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Don't let anyone fuck you off.

1064
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Breathe in slowly, please.

1065
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I've got a problem with her crying.

1066
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
I've got a problem with her sitting on her arse

1067
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
saying she doesn't feel well enough.

1068
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Stop doing anything.

1069
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
All our hearts are beating fast.

1070
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Julie, you just order me about all the time.

1071
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
I can't show you what I do.

1072
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Oh, my God.

1073
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
No, that's not true.

1074
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
That's absolutely not true.

1075
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Oh, my God, I was trapped the first day.

1076
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
We're in day four now.

1077
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
She needs a fucking rest.

1078
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
And that is it.

1079
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Thank you.

1080
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,240
Just remember to how you felt when you felt shit, OK?

1081
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
And leave it there.

1082
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
Tension in the camera really hurts.

1083
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
OK.

1084
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Oh, my gosh.

1085
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,240
It's just so hard.

1086
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,240
And I'm not going to leave this, so I've got this bit.

1087
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,240
I don't know how many days.

1088
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
Next time on the island...

1089
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
I think that was genuinely shitty,

1090
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
walking away and letting the rest of us die in a big way.

1091
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
We need to find food.

1092
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
That's the big issue on the camp.

1093
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Whoo!

1094
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Yeah!

1095
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

1096
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Fantastic.

1097
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,240
This island either wants to decompose you from the outside in...

1098
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
Argh!

1099
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
We nearly got killed, actually.

1100
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
..or eat you alive.

1101
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Everything around us is trying to kill us.

1102
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Argh!

1103
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Yeah, it's a scorpion.

1104
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
I'm dropping like flies. We've not even started yet.

1105
