0	14640	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14640	22920	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they
22920	29560	will be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in fishing equipment and a handful of
29560	38920	basic tools filming everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it
38920	49540	be brute power or mental strength the winds a day daddy brought home the Baker who will have
49540	58080	what it takes to stay alive tonight is the final installment of the women's I don't want to be on
58080	59540	camera today anybody
59540	69380	survival will be harder than ever the search for food is now a matter of life and death
69380	74660	it's a joke living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season
76660	86060	I think we are on our last leg when pitted against the extremes of nature with the finishing line in
86060	89540	sight these Monday women are
89540	96540	they just sleeping on a bit of ice an april 18th it's just a cold slide you've got to find
96540	102380	the hot potato first've got what it takes to survive I'll do what I'm wanting to do
102380	110120	I understand and go I'm not going to do it let me finish as usual arguments of the staff seeds
111540	115660	why cant you fucking know here and the baby fucking soon
116500	119400	After nearly five weeks of heat followed by a haberdam program which was a result of the
119400	126540	on the island the ten remaining women were on the verge of failure they were
126540	132420	dangerously dehydrated and had an urgent medical warning all the plug on this
132420	137220	that their lives were at risk in scary territory where we just don't know
137220	143440	what's happening to our bodies but they pulled themselves back from the brink
143440	152800	now entering their sixth week surviving on the island food in the camp vicinity
152800	157680	is running out the starving women face a battle to make it to the end
157680	169540	desperate for something to eat
169540	173080	Becky
173080	173420	Julie
173420	180420	and Georgie brave the vicious incoming tide to scavenge the last remaining oysters.
203420	219620	Oh, bloody hell. Today I'm feeling like absolute shit. I know that I keep saying I feel like
219620	228620	shit, but today I feel like dried white dog poo shit.
228620	233400	Since they've arrived on the island, the starving women have shed more than 140 pounds.
233400	238400	between them. The weight of an average woman.
238400	244160	Our coconut supply is running low. Our yucca around here is non-existent. The limes have
244160	249960	now gone. The almond fruits that grow on the trees here, we've eaten all of those.
249960	252080	Oh, they stink.
252080	257300	For six weeks, vegetarian Jamie has been surviving on nothing but nuts and coconuts.
257300	263300	As soon as I get off here, I need to get as much protein in me as I can.
263300	263380	Yeah.
263380	271480	I just had a day, but you'll get a big fat sausage in you as soon as you get off here.
271480	277480	Sometimes I do eat meat, but only the sausage variety. Sometimes I like a bit of chorizo,
277480	281480	but I don't like them chipolatas.
281480	284940	Here, let me help you.
284940	289480	With food so scarce around camp, the rest of the women are having to rely solely on
289480	293280	the fishing net they've set in the shallows.
293280	295280	Oh, I think that's something in the net.
295280	297280	It's a shark.
297280	299280	Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
299280	300280	That is unbelievable.
300280	307280	All right, got him. Quick, he's getting away.
307280	309280	No, he's got a way. He's got a way. He's got a way.
309280	316280	Oh, damn. Damn, damn, damn.
316280	318280	No supper for us tonight.
318280	323180	There's 10 of us, and I think we are on our last legs.
323180	327180	I think we are on our last legs.
327180	330180	When Mother Nature slams that larder door firmly shut,
330180	333180	things in a group can rapidly go downhill.
333180	336180	You're hungry, you're despondent, and it's so tempting to give up.
336180	339180	But like so many things in life and in the wild,
339180	343180	it's actually about how you respond to those crisis moments.
345180	351180	I've literally been up almost all night just trying to keep that fire alive.
351180	356180	From day one, the women have governed themselves in a leaderless community,
356180	358180	trying to make group decisions.
358180	361180	What, was there not enough wood? Have we run out of wood now?
361180	363180	We ran out of wood last night, and everyone went to...
363180	365180	You're joking. Yeah.
365180	367180	People just know they need to fucking get wood.
367180	370180	End of story. That's the bit that I don't get.
370180	374180	There's no leader. Not one person rules the roost.
374180	379180	We work collectively, so we have to kind of use our initiative
379180	380180	and work off the average.
380180	383180	So if, say, I want to go foraging,
383180	386180	I don't have to be told to go foraging.
386180	388180	I'm going to go foraging.
388180	392180	All the decisions we've made thus far have been made elaboratively.
392180	397180	We've not needed to conform to a system where there's a leader.
401180	404180	The women need to survive seven more days on the island.
404180	408180	Any hope of dinner depends entirely on catching fish.
408180	410180	The women are yet to be found.
410180	413180	It's time to establish a rota for checking the nets,
413180	415180	and Julie has made a discovery.
415180	418180	The net is in a right mess.
418180	422180	It's just... It's curled over that tight.
422180	424180	There's no teamwork.
424180	426180	There's no organisation.
428180	431180	There's... Nobody wants responsibility for anything.
433180	436180	Holy shit. It's an absolute state.
436180	438180	I mean, have you seen that?
438180	441180	It's crested, it's crested, it's crested.
441180	444180	High, stormy seas have destroyed their last hope
444180	446180	of getting something to eat.
446180	450180	Fishing is the only thing that we survive off at the minute.
450180	452180	We need to get it sorted ASAP.
454180	456180	It's just getting more and more tangled.
456180	459180	Yeah, I know, but just pulling it like that's going to rip it, isn't it?
459180	460180	No, it's not.
460180	462180	Well, it is when... I can feel it.
462180	464180	Well...
464180	466180	I'll just wait until we've used it.
466180	468180	Stop being a stroppy cow, Jamie. What's up with you?
470180	472180	Where's Jamie gone?
472180	475180	Fucking want to get fucking off here.
475180	477180	It better be fucking soon.
480180	483180	I would say I've had a hard life growing up.
483180	487180	My mum's got MS and she's been in a care home.
487180	491180	She's always said to me to basically live life to the full
491180	494180	because she's never been able to do the things that I've done.
494180	495180	It's made me...
495180	498180	It's made me extremely independent.
498180	501180	So if someone was to start bossing me about,
501180	506180	it would make me really upset and probably make me really angry.
509180	511180	I'll do what I want, when I want.
511180	514180	I don't want anybody telling me what to do, bossing me about.
514180	515180	Fed up.
515180	518180	We have to do things that, you know, we don't always want to do,
518180	520180	but it's for the team.
520180	523180	I've had enough of fucking everything!
525180	527180	It really is shit!
530180	533180	If anything's going to make me leave this island,
533180	535180	it's the people.
535180	537180	It's not like a team work.
539180	542180	Well, darling, I mean, I don't know what to say to you other than,
542180	544180	you know, I completely agree.
544180	547180	I thought we were all going to be a team and pull together and...
549180	551180	It's not like that at all, is it?
551180	553180	It's absolutely not like that at all.
554180	558180	The effects of starvation on the body are not just physical.
558180	562180	Extreme hunger makes people desperate, depressed, irritable,
562180	565180	and all the negative emotions that women are experiencing
565180	567180	will be amplified.
567180	570180	And if there are rifts emerging now, what hunger will do,
570180	574180	it will act like a crowbar, forcing those rifts further apart.
583180	587180	So, what's everybody doing? Can we just make it clear?
588180	591180	Nobody's taken responsibility to set a fire rotor,
591180	596180	so it's left to Beth and Lauren again to keep the embers going through the night.
596180	600180	I'm sorting out the fire. You're sorting out your socks.
600180	602180	While Jamie has slept.
602180	604180	I think you should help.
604180	607180	Right, well, do you know what I can't be doing with this?
607180	609180	Literally, you've got to bend over and get a fucking twig.
609180	612180	Well, just stop fucking bossing me about, right?
612180	614180	Look, there's Rose here.
614180	618180	I want to show my daughter that I can be brave.
618180	622180	I want to show her that there are endless possibilities
622180	624180	and a woman can do anything.
624180	628180	I'm hoping we're all going to group together and be a team,
628180	630180	especially because it's just a group of women.
630180	633180	I think we've all got a little bit of something to prove.
635180	636180	I will help when I'm ready.
636180	639180	I've been up all night with the frigging fire.
639180	641180	And I'm tired too.
641180	642180	And you're saying...
642180	644180	You're sitting there sorting out your fucking feet.
644180	646180	I've got socks on.
649180	651180	Whatever.
651180	653180	Fucking laziness. It's outrageous.
653180	656180	It's absolutely outrageous.
656180	660180	We're all a bit fed up with Jamie. There, I've said it.
660180	663180	It's really making me frustrated.
663180	665180	And...
665180	667180	..every time I stop,
667180	670180	I feel like people are looking at me.
670180	671180	Actually, you know,
671180	674180	I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...
674180	677180	I don't know, but I think we're going to end up killing each other
677180	679180	by the end of this, I really do.
681180	684180	We are completely dysfunctional as a group.
684180	688180	I find that deeply upsetting and deeply frustrating
688180	691180	that we're led by mush.
691180	695180	We need a leadership to get ourself together,
695180	697180	to get our food sorted,
697180	700180	and we just can't live from this sort of hand-to-mouth,
700180	702180	piecemeal way.
703180	706180	More thought needs to be going into this, for sure.
707180	710180	Lauren and Beth call an emergency meeting.
710180	714180	We're working for democracy and, you know, things are pretty positive.
714180	717180	Something...something has gone wrong somewhere.
717180	719180	What do you think has gone wrong?
719180	721180	We're literally starved.
723180	727180	The group feels fragmented and that we're not a unit.
727180	729180	I don't know how that fire's managed to keep going.
729180	732180	It's literally by luck and coincidence that we keep rocking up,
732180	735180	going, oh, fuck, the fire's literally just about to go out,
735180	738180	and, oh, God, I've just got that jab of water.
738180	741180	You know, it's basically lack of structure
741180	744180	because then we have lack of food and it's kind of a knock-on effect.
744180	748180	I think, personally, we need to decide on a leader
748180	752180	to set out what is needed and a plan of action.
752180	756180	I can hear you're really passionate, Georgie, and I totally get it,
756180	758180	but I think, for me, we collapse.
758180	762180	For me, we collaboratively lead the group.
762180	766180	Harvey, that system is not working because we've done that
766180	768180	and I think we're stumbling from one day to the next
768180	770180	and now we're in crises.
770180	773180	I'm with Harvey here. Why is it necessary to have the leader?
773180	775180	Because the leader knows where everything is.
775180	779180	The leader will lead you and go, right, OK, these are the priorities.
779180	785180	Why should I let somebody boss me about and tell me what to do?
785180	787180	I'll do what I want to do.
787180	790180	You cannot stand there and go, I'm going to do what I want to do
790180	793180	and if someone's telling me what to do, I'm not going to do it.
793180	795180	But we all need to come together.
795180	797180	Exactly, the arguments have started already.
797180	798180	It's not an argument, Jamie.
798180	801180	This is what happens when you try and elect leaders.
801180	804180	SHE GASPS
804180	806180	This is what I didn't want.
806180	808180	I know, I know.
808180	811180	The last few days.
811180	814180	This is what I didn't want.
814180	817180	Trying to improve their destructive group dynamic,
817180	819180	it is important for the women.
819180	821180	Now they've turned on each other,
821180	824180	they've pushed their very survival back into jeopardy
824180	828180	and without decisive leadership, they won't make it to the end.
828180	830180	I'm so torn. I'm torn.
830180	832180	I think the fact that we're so torn
832180	835180	means that there isn't ever going to be a leader.
837180	841180	I want a double cheeseburger with extra cheese,
841180	845180	extra gherkins, onions, a little bit of lettuce, tomato,
845180	846180	just for good measure.
846180	848180	It's the final week on the island.
848180	851180	Food is scarce and the women are starving.
851180	854180	Age. Don't talk about food.
854180	856180	What's the new rule we say?
856180	858180	Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis.
858180	861180	Just say that instead. It'll stop you thinking about it.
861180	864180	That's why I'm down today. I'm craving food.
864180	866180	Penis.
866180	868180	We're in a really shit situation
868180	870180	and there has to be someone that's ballsy enough
870180	872180	to grab the ball by the horns and go,
872180	874180	do you know what, guys, this is what we need to do.
874180	875180	MUSIC PLAYS
876180	878180	A violent storm is pummeling the island.
884180	886180	Is Jamie still out there?
886180	889180	Yeah, she's having some time now.
889180	892180	Most of the women are sheltering under the fire canopy,
892180	895180	but one of them has removed herself from the group.
895180	897180	Jamie's still toughing it out on the beach.
897180	907180	MUSIC CONTINUES
907180	911180	Soaping wet knickers. Isn't that the definition of sexy?
911180	913180	MUSIC CONTINUES
913180	917180	It's been a broken night's sleep, lying on the wet ground.
917180	919180	I'm like a fucking elephant, man.
919180	921180	It's really not that bad.
921180	923180	The rain has brought her back to the beach,
923180	925180	but she's not feeling too well.
925180	928180	The rain has brought an onslaught of insect attacks.
928180	931180	I do not want to be on camera today.
931180	934180	If anybody films me, I'll kick off.
934180	937180	The insect bites are driving me round the fucking bend.
937180	939180	I'd like to punch each fly in the nose.
939180	942180	We had something to fuck off biting us last night
942180	944180	and I had bites all over my arse.
944180	946180	Bloody ridiculous.
948180	951180	Basically get rid of all this shit on the roof.
951180	954180	Painful, itchy bites aren't their only problem.
955180	958180	I mean, there literally is a twig holding that fucking lot up.
958180	961180	The storm has wreaked havoc in camp.
961180	963180	That don't look good, honey.
963180	966180	The desperate hunt for food has to be put on hold
966180	970180	as the canopy protecting the fire is on the verge of collapse.
970180	973180	Is that big crack there running along the middle of it? Yeah.
975180	978180	How are you getting on? Slow.
978180	980180	But it's better than what we've got, right?
980180	982180	Which is zero right now.
982180	984180	To shield them from insects and rain,
984180	988180	Jamie and Georgie have decided to build a raised bed with a roof.
989180	991180	It's a very busy camp today
991180	994180	to make sure we have a good shelter for us.
994180	996180	And our fire is as dry as a boat.
996180	998180	All hands on deck.
998180	1000180	Down, down, down, down, down, down, there.
1000180	1002180	That's it, you got it.
1006180	1009180	Shall I go that end and push? Yeah.
1009180	1011180	Where's everybody gone?
1011180	1012180	I think Harvey and...
1012180	1014180	Me and Jamie are having a lie down.
1015180	1017180	It's just got too serious.
1017180	1019180	And I know we've got jobs to do,
1019180	1021180	but why is there so much pressure all of a sudden?
1021180	1023180	Guys, we haven't finished!
1023180	1025180	I know, I know we're not finished.
1025180	1027180	I was actually just having a little bit of a rest.
1027180	1030180	Ah! So give me a break, please.
1030180	1032180	I'm not saying that. I'm just saying you haven't finished.
1032180	1033180	That's all. Right.
1033180	1035180	Just whack them all on now.
1037180	1038180	Oh, God.
1038180	1039180	I'm sorry.
1039180	1040180	I'm sorry.
1040180	1041180	I'm sorry.
1041180	1042180	I'm sorry.
1042180	1043180	I'm sorry.
1044180	1046180	I think I might go on strike tomorrow.
1048180	1051180	Let's get this roof on, guys, and then we can have a proper tidy.
1053180	1055180	I'm going to kill myself with these fucking rockets.
1055180	1058180	While the rest of the group toil away on the bed shelter...
1061180	1064180	..Jamie and Belinda decide to take the afternoon off.
1068180	1071180	I kind of feel a little bit like, you know when someone comes into your house
1071180	1078180	and takes a massive shit in your toilet, eats all your food, messes your house,
1078180	1080180	and then leaves and goes, ''Bye now!''
1083180	1087180	We have been upset and tired and angry,
1087180	1090180	and so there's only so long that those things can go on for
1090180	1092180	until you have to do something.
1092180	1093180	So we have to change it.
1093180	1095180	If we're not happy, then do something about it.
1096180	1098180	Beth and Lauren take decisive action.
1098180	1100180	They call an election.
1101180	1102180	Jamie!
1102180	1103180	Hi.
1103180	1104180	Hi, love.
1104180	1105180	We're having a meeting.
1105180	1107180	Clothes are optional.
1108180	1111180	I find Jamie so unpredictable.
1111180	1115180	I don't know if she's going to shrug it off and just say, ''Oh, do you know what, whatever,''
1115180	1117180	or if she's going to kick off about it.
1119180	1121180	All the great expeditions have always had a leader,
1121180	1124180	whether it's Amazon, Scott or Shackleton,
1124180	1127180	but resistance to leadership is not uncommon.
1129180	1130180	We've called this meeting today...
1130180	1133180	..because not much has changed
1133180	1137180	and most people still want a leader.
1138180	1143180	If anybody would like to go for leadership,
1143180	1147180	please make yourself be known.
1151180	1152180	Me and Beth.
1156180	1158180	I'm confused, to be honest.
1158180	1161180	What's so bad?
1161180	1165180	We need a leader so everyone knows exactly what they're doing.
1165180	1167180	You know my feelings on the leadership.
1167180	1169180	Not happy with it.
1170180	1172180	Our whole experience has been amazing
1172180	1175180	and so I just want to end on success
1175180	1177180	and it means a lot, I think, to show that we never gave up.
1177180	1179180	Yeah. Yeah.
1179180	1180180	I so get you.
1180180	1184180	I so want Bear to come and look at our camp and think,
1184180	1186180	''Crikey, those girls were good.''
1186180	1187180	Do we need to take a vote?
1187180	1189180	I think we should just go forwards with it
1189180	1192180	because you're the only people who want to do it.
1192180	1194180	You're happy to go with Beth and Lauren?
1194180	1196180	Are people happy with that?
1200180	1201180	Jamie?
1201180	1202180	Yeah.
1205180	1208180	Lauren and Beth are going to run the leadership jointly.
1211180	1213180	After all of that, well done.
1213180	1214180	Thank you.
1214180	1215180	Be proud of yourselves.
1215180	1216180	Yeah.
1216180	1221180	I was so nervous leading up to it.
1221180	1224180	I was just thinking, ''Oh, my God, how's this going to be taken?''
1224180	1225180	Especially after the other day.
1225180	1228180	But, actually, it seemed pretty positive.
1232180	1234180	We need to just straighten out this end.
1234180	1238180	The new leader's first priority is to feed everyone.
1238180	1241180	We are now going to move the nets, basically,
1241180	1243180	at a different angle in the sea.
1243180	1245180	So, hopefully, we can get a fish.
1246180	1247180	Yeah.
1247180	1248180	We can get a fish.
1249180	1252180	Together, the women have untangled the vital fishing net.
1252180	1254180	OK. Keep it up.
1254180	1257180	They're now determined to finally land a big catch.
1260180	1262180	I think the net is great.
1262180	1263180	I think at least we're trying.
1263180	1265180	I think God loves to try it.
1267180	1270180	I think that Jamie is just feeling undervalued,
1270180	1272180	that sort of thing.
1272180	1275180	With all ten women needed to tackle a food crisis,
1275180	1278180	Lauren has to bring Jamie back into the fold.
1278180	1280180	We need every single one of those girls in the group
1280180	1282180	to get through this.
1282180	1285180	I know what it feels like to fail
1285180	1287180	at something that you give your all to,
1287180	1290180	and I'm not prepared to go through that again.
1292180	1296180	I probably picture myself as a bit of a young leader.
1296180	1299180	In 2013, I decided to row across the Atlantic.
1299180	1302180	But the boat capsized, I split my head open.
1302180	1305180	The failure of the row just left a huge void in me.
1305180	1307180	And then I thought, yep,
1307180	1309180	the island is definitely something I want to do.
1309180	1311180	This is definitely how I'm going to get it back.
1311180	1315180	I always give my everything to whatever challenge I set myself.
1315180	1318180	So when I fail, I feel...
1318180	1320180	I feel that in a big way.
1321180	1323180	Jay? Jamie?
1324180	1326180	So, I just want to clear the air.
1326180	1329180	I was feeling like you weren't helping out,
1329180	1332180	but what I should have done, absolutely what I should have done,
1332180	1334180	is come and talk to you about it.
1335180	1338180	I remember I woke up with them bites all over my face,
1338180	1341180	and that put me in a sort of vicious cycle
1341180	1344180	where I was, like, just not enjoying being here
1344180	1347180	and not motivated to do anything.
1347180	1350180	Get more involved. If you want to do stuff, like...
1350180	1353180	I do sometimes feel like I can't be arsed.
1353180	1355180	SHE LAUGHS
1355180	1357180	Oh, no!
1357180	1358180	I'm sorry.
1358180	1360180	I...
1360180	1362180	..probably come across selfish,
1362180	1364180	but I hope that they can...
1365180	1369180	..understand that I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and...
1372180	1376180	..I don't want to leave, you know, this island
1376180	1378180	feeling sour and bitter.
1380180	1383180	So, I think we're here. Yeah.
1383180	1385180	So, this is our beach.
1385180	1387180	Lauren's plan now is to search for food
1387180	1389180	beyond the confines of their beach.
1389180	1392180	We go up that track until we hit that middle path. Correct.
1392180	1394180	Then we go down with the sea.
1395180	1397180	Always on our left-hand side.
1397180	1400180	She leads a hunting party deep into the jungle.
1400180	1402180	See you later.
1402180	1403180	Along the coast...
1403180	1405180	SHE SCREAMS
1405180	1409180	Oh! My nail got stuck in this fucking gooey bat!
1409180	1413180	..vegetarian Jamie has volunteered to scavenge for limpets
1413180	1415180	to feed the rest of the group.
1415180	1417180	Oh, my God. Honestly, what is that?
1417180	1419180	Oh!
1419180	1422180	SHE SCREAMS
1422180	1424180	Anything?
1424180	1426180	Does that look rotten to you?
1426180	1429180	Yeah, yeah, an animal's been at it.
1429180	1431180	We've got snails the size of your head.
1431180	1434180	Woo-hoo! Shut the front door.
1434180	1436180	Wow!
1436180	1438180	The women on the other side of the island
1438180	1441180	are still on the hunt for yucca.
1441180	1445180	It would really suck to have come all of this way
1445180	1447180	and not find yucca.
1449180	1452180	Guys, I've just found a tin of something.
1452180	1453180	Whoa!
1454180	1456180	It might be a tin of peaches.
1456180	1457180	Oh, my God.
1457180	1458180	Thanks, baby.
1458180	1460180	SHE SCREAMS
1460180	1463180	Oh, my God!
1463180	1465180	That's going to make everyone super happy.
1465180	1467180	Yeah.
1467180	1468180	Guys!
1468180	1470180	Chloe!
1470180	1474180	We found two tins of baked beans!
1474180	1476180	You found beans?
1476180	1477180	SHE SCREAMS
1477180	1480180	The rusty tins are packed with protein and sugar
1480180	1483180	and may have been left by a hunting party from another island.
1483180	1485180	It's a lucky find.
1485180	1489180	Tonight, my dear, we have got a baked bean.
1489180	1491180	I can't wait.
1491180	1493180	I can't wait to eat it.
1493180	1494180	Oh!
1495180	1497180	What is in the tin?
1497180	1499180	Oh, wow!
1499180	1501180	It couldn't be better news for Jamie,
1501180	1505180	who survived on nothing but coconuts for weeks.
1505180	1507180	Fucking hell.
1507180	1509180	Oh, my God!
1509180	1512180	Is that not the nicest baked bean you've ever had in your life?
1512180	1513180	Beans!
1513180	1516180	You've actually turned the day around completely.
1516180	1519180	Thank you very much, Jamie.
1519180	1521180	Yeah, that was really sweet.
1521180	1525180	I've never been so excited about baked beans in all my life.
1525180	1528180	Oh, my God, this is amazing! This is amazing!
1528180	1531180	Oh, my God, what are we doing passing it round?
1531180	1534180	I can't even begin to tell you how good they are.
1534180	1536180	Oh, my God!
1539180	1541180	Sweet, yummy.
1542180	1545180	Tasty, tasty. Protein.
1545180	1548180	Thank you so much, girls.
1548180	1550180	From today onwards,
1550180	1553180	we're going to try and think about what needs to be done
1553180	1558180	to get the whole group to kind of work as one machine
1558180	1561180	to a point where we do have enough food.
1561180	1565180	It's Jamie's first belly-filling meal on the island.
1565180	1567180	Come on!
1567180	1569180	It's been six weeks!
1569180	1571180	No, it's been longer than that.
1572180	1574180	Oh, do you know what? Do you want to hear a funny story?
1574180	1576180	Oh, my God, this is hilarious.
1576180	1580180	As a dental technician, you know, like, the mould that you take of the teeth?
1580180	1584180	Well, you can use that stuff for also taking an impression of your cock.
1584180	1586180	That ex-boyfriend came round for dinner.
1586180	1588180	It was going on and on and on.
1588180	1590180	I want you to do my willy, I want you to do my...
1590180	1592180	Honestly, I've still got it to this day,
1592180	1595180	this big stone plaster cast of a willy.
1595180	1597180	Wow!
1597180	1600180	And it's like a lethal weapon, it weighs a tonne.
1600180	1601180	LAUGHTER
1602180	1605180	I personally have struggled.
1605180	1608180	Jesus, I have struggled.
1608180	1610180	But you know what?
1610180	1613180	To everyone that thought I wasn't going to survive...
1615180	1616180	..I'm here still.
1620180	1621180	Hiya!
1624180	1625180	6am.
1625180	1628180	We are on our way to catch some fishes.
1630180	1632180	Leaders Lauren and Jamie
1632180	1634180	and Lauren and Beth decide the time has come
1634180	1637180	for an all-out assault to conquer the island.
1637180	1640180	For the survivor, determination is a critical one
1640180	1644180	and I love that Winston Churchill quote that sums it up.
1644180	1648180	It just says, never, ever, ever quit.
1648180	1651180	Oh, that is beautiful.
1653180	1656180	So far, a big fish haul has eluded them.
1656180	1659180	The women are now praying their plan to reposition the net
1659180	1661180	has been successful.
1661180	1665180	I would give anything for there to be fish in this net now.
1665180	1667180	I'm scared, I don't want to look.
1667180	1669180	I'm in fear of disappointment.
1671180	1673180	Oh, what was that?
1673180	1675180	What have we got? What have we got?
1675180	1679180	So far, we've got two catfish, one other fish, two stingrays.
1679180	1680180	Yes!
1680180	1682180	LAUGHTER
1682180	1683180	Yes!
1683180	1685180	I'm so happy.
1685180	1687180	I'm so happy.
1687180	1689180	Give me!
1689180	1691180	Yes!
1691180	1694180	She'll have a fishy on a little dishy
1694180	1695180	She'll have a fishy...
1695180	1697180	Another stingray! Two!
1697180	1699180	Awesome work, awesome work.
1703180	1705180	So happy, it makes you so happy,
1705180	1707180	like, to know that you're going to eat.
1707180	1709180	That worry's not there now.
1712180	1714180	But it's sort of proved
1714180	1717180	that our survival skills aren't that bad
1717180	1718180	and we can make it work.
1719180	1720180	Yeah.
1727180	1729180	I do miss toilet seats.
1729180	1732180	Yeah, I can't wait to have a poo in the toilet.
1732180	1734180	Three days left on the island.
1734180	1736180	Guys, what's the plan for today?
1736180	1739180	We need two people to do water collection, ASAP.
1739180	1740180	I don't mind doing it again.
1740180	1742180	We just need to get shitloads of wood.
1742180	1745180	Then we're going to get on to cleaning this area,
1745180	1747180	cos it's gross.
1747180	1748180	Top plan, I love a plan.
1748180	1750180	Five minutes.
1751180	1755180	Lauren's new daily rota is galvanising the women.
1755180	1756180	Lauren, what are we doing?
1756180	1758180	Sweeping away the leaves.
1758180	1761180	Cos we're girls and we like a clean floor.
1763180	1765180	I'm going to put this over your head.
1765180	1766180	Oh, my God!
1766180	1768180	Get the camera down!
1768180	1769180	Oh, my God!
1771180	1775180	We've started to line the entrance with coconuts.
1775180	1776180	Now what we need is some candles.
1776180	1777180	Oh, wouldn't that be great?
1777180	1779180	Oh, wouldn't that be dreamy?
1779180	1781180	Seashell bunting.
1781180	1782180	It's absolutely beautiful.
1782180	1783180	I love making stuff.
1783180	1785180	That'll cost a fortune back home.
1785180	1788180	These guys can come together, they can look after each other,
1788180	1789180	they can build community,
1789180	1792180	they can find that kind of something inside that drives them on,
1792180	1794180	that positive stuff.
1794180	1796180	But also, ultimately, they're not just surviving,
1796180	1798180	they're now learning to thrive.
1798180	1800180	And that's when you kind of see the magic.
1800180	1803180	We've got enough food now, we've got enough water,
1803180	1806180	we've kept the fire going, and so our priority now is shelter.
1808180	1810180	Oh, here's a big bastard.
1810180	1811180	A big jobby.
1814180	1817180	Until that boat rocks up on this shore,
1817180	1820180	we're going to be tidying up, organising,
1820180	1821180	so it's about pride,
1821180	1823180	and it's wanting to show to the world
1823180	1826180	that what the majority of females are made of
1826180	1828180	and what we're capable of doing with nothing.
1828180	1830180	Oh, my God!
1831180	1833180	It's like a tent, isn't it?
1833180	1834180	Ooh!
1834180	1835180	Oh-ho!
1835180	1836180	Ooh!
1837180	1839180	Oh, God, it's nice, you know. It's a bit noisy.
1839180	1842180	Yeah, but... Oh, God, but it's comfortable.
1842180	1844180	Oh, it's lovely.
1844180	1847180	That is mega-wow!
1847180	1850180	I could rest my bones here for a while, me thinks.
1850180	1851180	And teamwork.
1851180	1854180	It's nice that we've all built something together, you know?
1854180	1856180	And I think it's amazing and awesome.
1858180	1859180	Carnival!
1859180	1861180	We'll take it to Rio.
1861180	1865180	Beth and Lauren's vision for how the island should run began.
1865180	1867180	Jesus, how much better is it?
1867180	1869180	I cannot begin to tell you.
1869180	1872180	Babes, come outside, I've got a present for you.
1872180	1873180	OK, close your eyes.
1873180	1874180	What is it?
1874180	1875180	Ready?
1877180	1879180	You fucking bitch!
1879180	1881180	I knew it was something like that!
1881180	1883180	I know you, you little bitch.
1885180	1887180	Relationships are renewed.
1887180	1889180	The camp is now secure and comfortable,
1889180	1891180	and finally there's food on the table.
1891180	1893180	This is our first lunch.
1893180	1894180	Now we've worked it out,
1894180	1898180	and I really think we have worked out how to do it.
1898180	1900180	Yay!
1900180	1902180	We've survived.
1902180	1906180	And most of all, now we are thriving.
1908180	1910180	Is the tide coming in or going out?
1910180	1911180	Coming in.
1913180	1916180	Becky, Lauren and Beth brave the morning tide
1916180	1918180	to fetch water for the camp.
1918180	1919180	We made it!
1919180	1921180	Whoo!
1921180	1923180	As they head back, Lauren and Beth
1923180	1925180	make a discovery.
1925180	1926180	Becky!
1927180	1929180	Oh, look what we found here!
1929180	1930180	Oh!
1930180	1932180	Oh, hi there!
1933180	1934180	Come and join me, ladies.
1934180	1936180	Yay!
1936180	1939180	Lauren plans to use a washed-up polystyrene block
1939180	1942180	as a raft to make the exhausting daily water run
1942180	1944180	easier and quicker.
1944180	1946180	Are you kidding me?
1946180	1947180	What?
1947180	1949180	The Vader raft?
1949180	1951180	That is amazing!
1951180	1952180	Whoo!
1953180	1959180	I never, ever thought it was going to be
1959180	1960180	as hard as it has been.
1960180	1963180	If I can complete this, then I know within myself
1963180	1967180	that I didn't fail at rowing across the Atlantic.
1967180	1968180	And I need that.
1968180	1969180	I need that closure.
1969180	1972180	I need that feeling that I am strong enough
1972180	1974180	within myself to finish something.
1974180	1976180	We come with water.
1976180	1978180	This hand is next to the navy.
1978180	1980180	Bear grouse can bugger off.
1980180	1981180	We've got Lauren.
1981180	1982180	We're fine.
1982180	1984180	I'm coming!
1984180	1986180	With the fight for survival mastered,
1986180	1989180	they can now embrace the island's delights.
1989180	1991180	Great swim!
1993180	1995180	I think in both survival and in life,
1995180	1997180	you know, good things and worthwhile things
1997180	1998180	don't always come easy.
1998180	2001180	And for those that can endure on the island,
2001180	2003180	there will come a time when they will be able
2003180	2004180	to make the most of it.
2004180	2006180	And I think that's what we're going to do.
2006180	2009180	I'm sure on the island there will come a sense of pride
2009180	2011180	that money really can't buy, you know,
2011180	2013180	and it's a pride that will have been hard earned
2013180	2016180	through heart, through grit and through endeavour.
2026180	2027180	What are we up to?
2027180	2030180	We're going to check the net and...
2030180	2031180	Crab hunting!
2031180	2033180	Woo-hoo!
2033180	2035180	So excited!
2036180	2039180	As their days on the island draw to a close,
2039180	2043180	the women are seizing every opportunity to get food.
2043180	2045180	Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
2045180	2046180	Oh!
2046180	2047180	Julie's got a big one!
2047180	2048180	Right, got him!
2048180	2049180	Give us that bucket!
2049180	2051180	Yeah, go on, get him in, yeah!
2051180	2052180	In, in, in!
2052180	2053180	Woo!
2053180	2054180	You got another one?
2054180	2055180	Yeah!
2055180	2056180	Oh!
2056180	2057180	Julie!
2057180	2059180	Don't let him into your bucket!
2059180	2061180	He's in, he's in, he's in.
2061180	2062180	Great, great.
2062180	2064180	He's a fucking monster, that one.
2064180	2065180	Yeah.
2065180	2068180	Julie, you've turned into an absolute animal.
2068180	2069180	Get in there.
2069180	2071180	Oh, my God.
2071180	2073180	What's happened to me?
2073180	2076180	I was a lady in the pool.
2078180	2080180	To follow the crab starter,
2080180	2083180	they're hoping to catch a main course in their fishing net.
2084180	2087180	This one's very...wrunkled.
2087180	2089180	Have a quick look.
2089180	2091180	There's the butter.
2092180	2094180	There's a fish, there's a fish!
2094180	2095180	No.
2095180	2096180	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2096180	2097180	Got a big one!
2097180	2098180	Wow!
2098180	2099180	Fuck me, what is it?
2099180	2100180	What is it?
2100180	2101180	It's huge!
2101180	2102180	It's a shark!
2102180	2103180	A shark!
2103180	2104180	He's still alive!
2104180	2105180	I need something to hit him with.
2105180	2106180	I need a big piece of wood.
2106180	2107180	OK, OK, I'll get it.
2107180	2108180	There's a bit of wood.
2108180	2109180	I've got it.
2109180	2110180	I've got it.
2110180	2111180	Ready?
2111180	2112180	I've got it.
2112180	2113180	I've got it.
2113180	2114180	I've got it.
2114180	2115180	I've got it.
2115180	2116180	I've got it.
2116180	2117180	I've got it.
2117180	2118180	I've got it.
2118180	2119180	I've got it.
2119180	2120180	I've got it.
2120180	2121180	I've got it.
2121180	2122180	I've got it.
2122180	2123180	I've got it.
2123180	2124180	I've got it.
2124180	2125180	I've got it.
2125180	2126180	Ok, good job, guys.
2126180	2127180	I hope everyone's hungry!
2127180	2128180	Right, come on, ladies.
2128180	2129180	Soapies!
2129180	2130180	Fish for breakfast, Fish for supper.
2130180	2131180	Nailing it!
2131180	2135260	Here, take this one.
2135260	2137180	That's delicious.
2137180	2138520	Foo Corn!
2138880	2142080	Look at the colour!
2142080	2143080	Foo Corn!
2143080	2144180	Thank you, all.
2144180	2145180	Foo Corn!
2145180	2147080	Thank you, all!
2147080	2148080	Foo Corn!
2148080	2149080	Foo Corn!
2149080	2150080	Right, I am.
2150080	2151080	Foo Corn!
2151080	2152080	Foo Corn!
2152080	2153080	Foo Corn!
2153080	2156080	Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is Bravo, Emma.
2156080	2158080	This is Foxtrot.
2158080	2160080	I have for some news for you, ladies.
2160080	2163080	Tomorrow, a man called Bear will be coming to your island.
2163080	2165080	You are coming home.
2165080	2168080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2173080	2176080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2176080	2178080	Yay!
2178080	2180080	Wow!
2180080	2185080	We've got on the island and we've actually done it.
2185080	2187080	Well done. Well done.
2187080	2190080	It's mad. I feel numb and I feel fear.
2190080	2193080	You know when you've had, like, a near miss in the car or something...
2193080	2195080	Yeah. ..and you go like...
2195080	2197080	..like that, and then it hits and you go a bit numb
2197080	2200080	and you have to pull over cos you're a bit shaky? Yeah.
2200080	2202080	I feel like I've just been nearly hit.
2202080	2205080	It's a women's final night on the island.
2205080	2208080	OK, so we need to find some sort of cup. Do we have a sort of cup?
2208080	2210080	And there's much to celebrate.
2210080	2212080	Yeah.
2212080	2213080	Oh!
2213080	2216080	I got my ticket for the long way round
2216080	2219080	Two bottle whiskies by the way
2219080	2223080	And I sugar like some sweet company
2223080	2227080	And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?
2227080	2231080	When I'm gone, when I'm gone
2231080	2234080	You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
2234080	2236080	You're gonna miss me by my hair
2236080	2238080	You're gonna miss me everywhere
2238080	2240080	Oh, you're still gonna miss me
2240080	2242080	When I'm gone
2250080	2253080	Life is either a great adventure or nothing.
2253080	2255080	As fast as we can!
2255080	2259080	We're a group of completely ordinary, down-to-earth women.
2259080	2261080	Oh!
2261080	2263080	You fucking snake, it came towards me!
2263080	2265080	It came right at me!
2266080	2268080	With no survival experience.
2268080	2269080	Fuck.
2269080	2271080	Oh my god, there's a caiman.
2271080	2273080	That is a big fucker.
2273080	2276080	We faced adversity every step of the way.
2276080	2280080	We cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost.
2280080	2281080	But we kept fighting.
2281080	2283080	Get the knife, get the knife!
2283080	2287080	You are not leaving this island till the fucking end game, right?
2289080	2291080	We were wet, cold and starving.
2291080	2295080	I just need to get some food. Just something.
2295080	2297080	Yet we found the strength
2297080	2299080	to keep pushing on.
2300080	2301080	Look at that little fire.
2301080	2303080	Fucking giant one!
2303080	2304080	Look at this!
2304080	2306080	If we hadn't have kept going,
2306080	2308080	it would have been the end.
2313080	2315080	In time, those memories will fade.
2315080	2317080	But what we will remember
2317080	2319080	are the women we experienced it with,
2319080	2321080	the friendships,
2321080	2323080	and how they made us feel.
2323080	2325080	Yeah!
2325080	2327080	We're winning.
2329080	2332080	Tomorrow, the women finally go home.
2332080	2333080	It's really weird.
2333080	2336080	We all feel so comfortable, in a way, with each other.
2336080	2337080	Sort of like a family.
2337080	2339080	I want to go home, but I don't want to leave.
2339080	2341080	I know.
2341080	2343080	I know what you mean.
2344080	2346080	Is that a boat? That's his boat.
2346080	2348080	Oh, my god.
2348080	2350080	We've never done this before.
2350080	2352080	14 women left on their own with nothing
2352080	2354080	in some of the harshest environments on the planet.
2354080	2356080	You know, they really are just ordinary people
2356080	2357080	from all walks of life.
2357080	2358080	Whoo!
2358080	2360080	And it hasn't just pushed them to the limits.
2360080	2363080	To be honest, it will have pushed them beyond that.
2363080	2367080	And what speaks volumes is that they're still there.
2371080	2373080	Whoo!
2373080	2375080	Yes!
2375080	2377080	Ten very grateful women.
2377080	2378080	Oh, god.
2378080	2380080	Oh, my god, it's actually happening.
2380080	2381080	It's actually happening.
2381080	2382080	This is amazing.
2382080	2383080	Whoo!
2384080	2385080	Whoo!
2385080	2386080	Whoo!
2386080	2387080	Whoo!
2387080	2388080	Whoo!
2388080	2389080	Whoo!
2389080	2390080	Whoo!
2390080	2391080	Whoo!
2391080	2392080	Whoo!
2392080	2393080	Wow.
2393080	2394080	Hi.
2394080	2395080	Hi.
2395080	2396080	Welcome.
2396080	2397080	Wow.
2397080	2398080	Look at you.
2398080	2399080	Look at you guys.
2399080	2400080	This is how best it is.
2400080	2402080	Genuinely, what you've been through, respect.
2402080	2403080	Thank you.
2403080	2409080	You now understand this stuff is tough, you know?
2409080	2411080	Thank you.
2411080	2412080	Well done, you.
2412080	2413080	Well done, you.
2413080	2414080	Well, welcome.
2414080	2416080	Wow, look at this. This is cool.
2416080	2418080	It's very cool. Here's our art installation.
2418080	2420080	And it's so clean.
2420080	2421080	I love this.
2421080	2422080	That's Harvey.
2422080	2423080	Thank you.
2423080	2425080	It's the little touches.
2425080	2427080	We've got a bed made of bottles
2427080	2429080	and a separate area for sitting and lounging around
2429080	2431080	and, you know, just generally hanging out.
2431080	2433080	This is so smart. It's getting you off the ground,
2433080	2435080	but it's communal.
2435080	2437080	Let's face it, girls, we like spoons, don't we?
2437080	2439080	We love a spoon. We love a spoon.
2440080	2443080	We've met the stereotype
2443080	2447080	with our decorations and our little feminine touches,
2447080	2450080	but totally blown it away
2450080	2453080	by the strength and the stamina
2453080	2456080	and the guts and the determination.
2456080	2459080	These women have got balls,
2459080	2462080	and big balls at last.
2462080	2463080	I would agree with that.
2463080	2465080	You ready to get the hell off this island?
2465080	2468080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2468080	2469080	Dude! Dude!
2469080	2471080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2473080	2475080	If I hadn't turned up today,
2475080	2477080	and I turn up in six months,
2477080	2479080	I bet these guys would be in pretty good shape.
2479080	2481080	Oh, don't be mean to me.
2481080	2483080	Don't be mean to me.
2485080	2486080	And I knew it.
2486080	2489080	I knew the stereotype was wrong, you know?
2489080	2491080	But I knew they could nail this.
2491080	2494080	And for me, I'm so genuinely proud
2494080	2496080	of what they have achieved.
2496080	2498080	And they should be. And they are.
2498080	2501080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2501080	2502080	Woo!
2502080	2504080	Thank you.
2504080	2507080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2507080	2509080	Oh, my God!
2509080	2511080	Oh, my God!
2511080	2512080	Oh, my God!
2512080	2515080	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
2515080	2518080	I'm so proud of all of us that we've achieved this.
2518080	2522080	We have shown the world that women can achieve anything.
2524080	2526080	What I've learned is I need to appreciate
2526080	2527080	what I've got right now
2527080	2530080	and not strive to look for other better things.
2530080	2532080	I think it's made me more confident.
2532080	2533080	I've gained.
2534080	2537080	I've decided that I'm OK.
2537080	2539080	I'm not such a bad person.
2539080	2541080	I'm a good skin.
2542080	2545080	But being here, I felt so alive.
2545080	2547080	And I thought, God, this is me.
2547080	2548080	I feel happy.
2548080	2551080	And so, yeah, for me, I feel like this is it.
2551080	2554080	This is where I get something out of life.
2554080	2556080	And I want to run with it.
2556080	2559080	But I've survived for nearly two months,
2559080	2560080	and we've done it.
2560080	2562080	I can do any shit that I want.
2562080	2564080	And so can anybody else.
2564080	2565080	And it's brilliant.
2565080	2566080	We're amazing.
2570080	2571080	Woo!
2571080	2573080	We're nearly there!
2573080	2575080	Yes!
2575080	2577080	OK, ladies, welcome back to civilisation.
2577080	2578080	Yeah!
2578080	2579080	Oh!
2579080	2580080	Oh!
2580080	2581080	Oh!
2581080	2582080	Oh!
2582080	2583080	Oh!
2585080	2587080	I'm so glad I made it.
2587080	2589080	I can't believe I made it.
2589080	2591080	I'm getting emotional over that.
2591080	2592080	I've just been that brave.
2592080	2594080	I've been really brave.
2594080	2595080	Oh, for me.
2598080	2601080	The women have had no contact with the outside world
2601080	2604080	and loved ones for six weeks.
2604080	2606080	Hi, Mum.
2607080	2608080	Are you OK?
2616080	2618080	Are you OK?
2618080	2620080	Yeah, it was amazing.
2620080	2623080	It was really fucking hard as well.
2623080	2624080	Hello?
2624080	2625080	Hello?
2627080	2628080	Oh, my God!
2628080	2629080	Baby!
2631080	2633080	We can't wait to see you.
2633080	2634080	Yeah.
2634080	2635080	I've loved...
2635080	2638080	I've missed you all as well more than I ever imagined.
2638080	2640080	Hello, Daddy.
2640080	2642080	I've missed you so much.
2644080	2645080	Oh, God.
2645080	2647080	It's, like, sensational.
2647080	2648080	Oh.
2648080	2649080	Oh, my God.
2649080	2650080	Having been stripped of any luxuries,
2650080	2651080	they're finally reintroduced to the modern world.
2651080	2652080	Oh, my God.
2652080	2653080	How nice does that feel?
2653080	2654080	What's this?
2654080	2655080	Ooh!
2655080	2656080	Oh!
2656080	2657080	What's it like?
2657080	2658080	Oh, look at my hair.
2658080	2659080	Amazing.
2659080	2660080	The way it cuts your bottom.
2660080	2661080	What the hell?
2661080	2662080	My eyebrows!
2662080	2663080	God, it's so clear.
2663080	2664080	Oh, my God.
2664080	2665080	Oh, my God.
2665080	2666080	Oh, my God.
2666080	2667080	Oh, my God.
2667080	2668080	Oh, my God.
2668080	2669080	Oh, my God.
2669080	2670080	Oh, my God.
2670080	2671080	Oh, my God.
2671080	2672080	Oh, my God.
2672080	2673080	Oh, my God.
2673080	2674080	Oh, my God.
2674080	2675080	Oh, my God.
2675080	2676080	Oh, my God.
2676080	2677080	Oh, my God.
2677080	2678080	Oh, my God.
2678080	2679080	Oh, my God.
2679080	2680080	Oh, my God.
2680080	2681080	Oh, my God.
2681080	2682080	Oh, my God.
2682080	2683080	Oh, my God.
2683080	2684080	Oh, my God.
2684080	2685080	Oh, my God.
2685080	2686080	It's so clean.
2686080	2687080	I love clean, being clean, you know.
2687080	2688080	This is amazing!
2688080	2689080	The women's bodies are in a fragile state,
2689080	2693060	and for the first three days, they must stick to a simple diet.
2693060	2694060	No!
2694060	2695060	That drinks.
2695060	2696060	Yay!
2696060	2697060	That is great.
2697060	2698060	Thank you very much.
2698060	2699060	Is this chicken?
2699060	2700060	Oh!
2700060	2701060	Yes, it is.
2701060	2702060	Even the smell of the rice.
2702060	2703060	It's so good.
2703060	2704060	Oh, my God.
2704060	2705060	I mean, it's so good.
2705060	2706060	It's so good.
2706060	2707060	This is good.
2713580	2716060	It's our first meal off the island, girls.
2716140	2718660	Cheers!
2718740	2720540	Cheers!
2722460	2726820	This experiment ultimately shows that, really, it isn't about gender.
2726900	2728500	It's about attitude.
2728580	2732060	Some people have that heart and mind of a survivor.
2732140	2734340	Determined, team players,
2734340	2736180	hard-working, resourceful.
2736260	2741500	What these ordinary women have been through genuinely is remarkable.
2741580	2743860	They've endured unbelievable hardships
2743940	2747940	and they've come out of it empowered and positive.
2748020	2751020	And for that, they've won my respect.
2751100	2752100	Big time.
2761060	2763060	It's like the best company ever, isn't it?
2764340	2766340	Hello!
2768180	2771180	You can't just come off a boat and stay in the same place.
2773220	2774420	Please, walk!
2774500	2775500	Walk!
2777900	2781300	Next time, it's the final instalment of the men's island.
2783860	2785260	I'm going to go to hell for this.
2785340	2786860	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2786940	2787940	I'm a scorpion.
2788020	2789820	People are just starting not to give a shit anymore.
2789900	2791620	Come on, boys!
2791700	2793620	Son!
2793620	2796740	Mother Nature and this island will bite you whenever she feels fit.
2823620	2826180	It only starts on the first week of the trip.
2826260	2827460	Suzanne, stay here!
2827540	2829300	I'll meet you in my cell.
2829380	2830380	Hey, Dan!
2830700	2832060	Thar...
2832140	2833500	Humph!
2834580	2836100	It's a poder safety method,
2836180	2837220	I'd say it's about time.
2837300	2838220	Not yet.
2838620	2839620	The options are like that.
2839700	2841300	You dirty seagulls.
2841380	2842620	It'd be happiness for me to know
2842700	2844980	what exactly those seagulls think about that labor.
2845060	2846540	Some get by time to get the farm going.
2846620	2847660	If you are going to do it,
2847740	2848700	start in the headaches.
2848780	2850940	If you continue to work with a double,
2851020	2852020	not an founders' job.
2852100	2852900	You deal with it.
