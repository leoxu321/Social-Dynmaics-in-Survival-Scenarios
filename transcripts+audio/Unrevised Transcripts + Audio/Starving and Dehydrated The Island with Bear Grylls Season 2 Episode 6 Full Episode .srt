1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,920
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,880
be utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,080
everything themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance so thin now will it be brute

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,700
power or mental strength the winds a day watch him watch him go now go now who will have what

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:58,020
it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than

7
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
ever they'll have to make fire

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:09,660
hunt for food and find water oh living on the island in the middle of Tropical storm season

9
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,580
I'm still wet worse night's sleep like surely I'm gonna die soon hang on

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,740
when pitted against the extremes of nature

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,080
have these Monday women got what it takes to survive

12
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,980
just remember to how you felt when you felt and leave it there

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,380
it's been seven days since 14 British women were marooned on a remote Pacific Island

14
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:59,460
brutal conditions have already claimed two victims

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,780
I need to go it's been with my family and the group paid the price when they split to

16
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,240
find a sustainable water source we cannot walk anywhere on this island without getting lost

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:25,140
finally reunited after three days apart the women find themselves on the northern tip of the island

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,760
they have no water source and many haven't had a drop to drink for two days

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:39,540
it's sunny

20
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:53,100
so it is blaring so hot there is no outside input and it is up to us to survive and thrive

21
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,320
that is a heck of a challenge

22
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,840
oh my gosh

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
despite the oppressive

24
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:13,520
30 degree heat there's something to celebrate for one of the party if you'd

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,180
have asked me a year ago where I'll be spending my 25th birthday I definitely

26
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,440
would not have been saying oh my 25th birthday will be spent abandoned on an

27
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,260
island dehydrated and starving for the last five days the women have barely

28
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:38,160
eaten and had hardly anything to drink finding water it's a priority the only

29
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,860
reason we're not thinking about food is because we're so thirsty our body

30
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,500
basically tries and like compensates for everything that we're lacking when it

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,700
comes to survival I often talk about the rule of three which means you can survive

32
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,100
three minutes without air three days without water three weeks without food

33
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,240
and in temperatures like this the water is not enough for you to survive you

34
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,280
women have got to drink a lot between two or four liters of water a day if

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:12,580
they don't they're finished the Sun obviously makes you feel more dehydrated

36
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,120
and more weak without a sustainable water source they're surviving on rain

37
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,000
water but there hasn't been a drop for 48 hours looking at the sea you just

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,240
want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea you just want to drink the sea water keep dreaming about the sea

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,940
it's really about diet iron brew cold freezing cold diet iron brew with ice

40
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,500
oh my god my other birthday's and I'm stressing out because no one's got me a

41
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,520
card or no one's come out for a meal and I'm just gonna be happy with some a

42
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,020
piece of fruit and some water

43
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,500
I think a bogey just came out my nose

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
eat it! eat it! eat it!

45
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Waste! Waste nothing!

46
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I've always loved adventure.

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,240
In December 2013, I set off on transatlantic rowing race,

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
3,000 miles across to Antigua.

49
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
It's the 30th of January and we have just had a capsize.

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I have split my head open.

51
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I didn't want to give up.

52
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,240
It had been 96 days of pushing my body and pushing my mind

53
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
further than I ever had before,

54
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
but we still had to give up.

55
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
So that's hard to come to terms with.

56
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I will not get off the island.

57
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
I have to prove to myself that I can do it.

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Happy birthday, Lauren.

59
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Superwoman.

60
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
She's keeping us all sane.

61
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
She's keeping us all sane.

62
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Celebrations are short-lived.

63
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,240
The women have a life-or-death priority.

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Seeing the effect that dehydration has,

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I couldn't really have predicted that it could be so disabling.

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

67
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
They were going to be a little bit more than that.

69
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
We ain't coming back until we've found water.

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
We ain't coming back until we've found water.

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Georgie leads a group on a scouting mission

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
into the thick jungle.

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
into the thick jungle.

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
There are no pools, which is what we're after.

75
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
There are no pools, which is what we're after.

76
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,240
I've made sure that the island has got enough water,

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
indigenous animals, and vegetation on it to keep them alive,

78
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it,

79
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
That's quite a deep pool. It's empty.

80
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
It's just the same shit.

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
If we don't find water, we're screwed.

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
What is that?

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh, my God, there's two piglets!

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Oh, my God!

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Oh, my God.

86
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Be careful cos if Mum's there...

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
I can actually see Mum over here.

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Oh, oh, careful. Come away.

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,240
If Mum thinks the kids are threatened,

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
that's when they get really aggressive.

91
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,240
She's lying down. Come away, sweetheart.

92
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
She's massive. She's enormous.

93
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
She's, like, really near.

94
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
The piglets, the first thing I thought of was crackling,

95
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
to be honest.

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I am hungry.

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I don't think I could look into his little piggy eyes

98
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
and then kill him. I'm not ready for that yet.

99
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
But then again,

100
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
by the time I come home,

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,240
I'll probably be a full-blown fucking, I don't know, cannibal.

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
The pigs are given a reprieve.

103
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Right now, everyone's lives depend on finding water.

104
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
What are we going to do?

105
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
You can sit down.

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Oh!

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Ah!

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
We're all buggered.

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
No energy to move.

110
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Brian? You all right?

111
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Are you OK? What's wrong?

112
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Whenever I stand up, I just see all black.

113
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
That's dehydration, babe.

114
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
The situation is now critical.

115
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
We're going foraging. Water.

116
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
In a do-or-die attempt to find water...

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Please be careful.

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
..Georgie and Fi strike out in the midday sun.

119
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I just think...

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I just couldn't sit and wilt in that sun down there.

121
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
The weather here is brutal.

122
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
You know, you've got 90%-plus humidity.

123
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
The heat here is oppressive.

124
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,240
So finding that fresh water source is vital.

125
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
The bottom line is, you go three days without it, you're dead.

126
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
It's so hot today. So, so hot.

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I think we should look on here and then go back.

128
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I think I'm being in a much better way.

129
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I think we should look on here and then go back.

130
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm not eating.

131
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Really fast.

132
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Ooh!

133
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Hard work.

134
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
It's water. Ah! This looks good.

135
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Jesus Christ!

136
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
We did it!

137
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
We did it!

138
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, yeah, baby.

139
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I don't give a fuck where that came from.

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
We're drinking it.

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh!

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Amazing.

143
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
So, we hit the jackpot.

144
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Picked this out.

145
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
OK, it's not over yet.

146
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
But you know what?

147
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
If I die, I don't care.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
At least I don't die thirsty.

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Hmm.

150
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.

151
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,240
But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.

152
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,240
All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.

153
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
And no matter how clean the water looks, you've got to boil it.

154
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Guess what I've got?

155
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Water!

156
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Oh, yeah!

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Oh, my God!

158
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm not going to lie to you.

159
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
You drink it at your own risk.

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,240
It came from a waterfall, and it tastes fine.

161
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Don't drink it.

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Every water from waterfall, river, whatever,

163
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
has to be filtered and boiled.

164
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Because of the parasites, it's just...

165
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
It's a death trap.

166
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Complete.

167
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
The whole island is a death trap.

168
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
The thing is, though, we need to get this fire started,

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
because if we don't get this fire started, we're back to zero again.

170
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
We're back to no fucking water.

171
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
They haven't been able to start a fire for three days.

172
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
If they're to survive, this is their last chance.

173
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I won't stop until the fire is ready.

175
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Because then I know that we can drink.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Yeah.

177
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Just go through that smoke.

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Pretend it's not even smoking.

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I think we've got it, I think we've got it.

180
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Go, stop, stop.

181
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
It's really hard.

182
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
And again, and again.

183
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
It's got enough...

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
It's there, it's there, it's there.

185
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Well done!

186
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Guys, we've got fire!

187
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Well done, girls!

188
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Woo!

189
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Woo!

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Can we just taste the water?

191
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Ah, look, look, look, look, look, look.

192
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Look at that fire.

193
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
The water won't be safe to drink

194
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
until it has boiled some three hours later.

195
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Meanwhile, Lauren's keeping the fire going.

196
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
The fire is so hot, it's burning through everything.

197
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
The busty girl...

198
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Yeah.

199
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
..is doing all the hard work, and she's exhausted.

200
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
I'd say that Lauren and Beth...

201
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Lauren and Beth...

202
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
..are always the first in there to help.

203
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Rosé, they think of things.

204
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Oh, shit!

205
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Oh, shit!

206
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Lauren, Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!

207
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Go to the sea now!

208
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Fucking hell!

209
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Shit!

210
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

211
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Oh, fuck!

212
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Right in there, babe!

213
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Get her right immersed in the sea.

214
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Jesus!

215
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Oh, fuck!

216
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Oh, shit!

217
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Lauren, come this way, this way, this way!

218
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Go to the sea!

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Go into the sea now!

220
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Go right into the sea, cos it's cold.

221
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Day seven on the island,

222
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
and Lauren's been tending a jerrycan of boiling water on the fire.

223
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
She opened the lid and it just exploded in our face.

224
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Jesus! What's happened? What's happened?

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
The pressure of the jerrycan has exploded.

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
How are you feeling?

227
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Fine. OK.

228
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Stay there for now. Keep in the water.

229
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
For the moment, Dr Belinda can't tell how badly scolded Lauren is.

230
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,240
What you say is to run whatever it is under cold water for exactly...

231
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,240
We'll see the extent of it in a minute.

232
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Just everything seems to be going a bit...

233
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
It's just her 15 years old,

234
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
so she thinks Lauren's, like, one of our strongest people.

235
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
So if she goes down, I think it would be a big detriment to us.

236
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
It's like doing your water on your engine.

237
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,240
You've got to let it cool down before you open the top screw top.

238
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
If her burns prove to be severe,

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Lauren will be in trouble.

240
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Lauren may have to be evacuated.

241
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Poor Lauren. She's not having the best birthday ever.

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
She's dehydrated and now scolded by boiling water.

243
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm just going to keep dampening you and letting it cool.

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Hopefully she will be back to full strength soon.

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Lauren's face isn't scolded,

246
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,240
and Dr Belinda believes she can treat the burns on her arm.

247
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Especially in the blistered area. That's the worst bit.

248
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,240
It feels like someone is singeing my arm with a hot poker.

249
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
I feel like people see that I'm feeling just as weak as them

250
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
because I actually feel like some people need strength

251
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
and other people to keep them going,

252
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
and I'm determined to be that person.

253
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
It's alive!

254
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm still standing.

255
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
It won't get boring, it won't get boring.

256
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Despite the jerrycan exploding,

257
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,240
just enough water remains for everyone to have a life-saving drink.

258
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Pick your own bottle.

259
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Is it all the same?

260
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
You just used it once.

261
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
No, I asked for whisky and coke.

262
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Oh, I've went for some aloe vera.

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Original drink.

264
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
And aloe vera is disgusting.

265
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
I tried it with a detox and it tastes like sperm.

266
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
There's a pig! Pig! There!

267
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Oh, yeah!

268
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Now they have a water source, food.

269
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Food should be the women's big priority.

270
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Biggie, biggie, biggies!

271
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
Hello!

272
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
All they've eaten in a week

273
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
are a few handfuls of yucca and coconut.

274
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,240
We've got two of the cutest little piglets here.

275
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Their little tails wag like dogs. They're so cute.

276
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Everything that moves on that island

277
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
really should be seen as a potential source of food,

278
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
and that includes the pigs.

279
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Oh, you're so cute! Come here, Sage!

280
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Onion!

281
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Ooh!

282
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,240
To befriend them is just going to make the decision

283
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
to kill them a thousand times more difficult.

284
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
And really, in survival, there's no room for sentiment.

285
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Sorry, I'm just being joined here.

286
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,240
I can hear you squeaking. What are you squeaking about?

287
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
And everyone's like, oh, they're so cute, they're so cute.

288
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Like, we're going to eat them as pets.

289
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
And I'm like, I'm just thinking, you know,

290
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
put that girl's, like...

291
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
We're literally going to slice and dice those piggies.

292
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Definitely, we're eating them.

293
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Suckling pig.

294
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Nah.

295
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Would you not eat them?

296
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
No, they're so cute.

297
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I don't care that they're cute.

298
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,240
As the time goes on, we'll be hungrier and hungrier,

299
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,240
but I am not killing the little piglets and eating them.

300
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
No way.

301
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
They're so funny.

302
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Argh!

303
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,240
I've been a vegetarian basically since I was born.

304
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I think it's going to be a massive challenge,

305
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,240
if I have to, by choice, eat meat.

306
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
But then again, maybe it's not going to be a choice,

307
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
because I'll be so starving and I'll just have to eat it.

308
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
I would definitely say I'm an animal person

309
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
rather than a people's person.

310
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
You know, animals are less stressful sometimes.

311
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I will train them pigs.

312
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll kick them up the arse.

313
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
The moral argument is,

314
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,240
is do we now eat the pigs,

315
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,240
but then do you kill, essentially, your pet?

316
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Piggy, piggy, piggies.

317
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Sagey, onion.

318
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
With water running low...

319
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Careful, these rocks are uber fucking slippy.

320
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,240
..an expedition party makes the hazardous journey

321
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
back to the waterfall.

322
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
That's it, guys, we're nearly there.

323
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Jamie, hang on.

324
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh!

325
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Shit.

326
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I saved the camera!

327
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Good job.

328
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
That's it there.

329
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Shit doesn't look like it's running, for fuck's sake.

330
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
No!

331
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I don't understand.

332
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
This was pouring with water the other day.

333
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
And it's dry.

334
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
It's like...

335
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Toll-oo.

336
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Toll-oo.

337
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Every day, it's gone.

338
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
The water source may be dry,

339
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
but fortunately in the tropics,

340
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
the weather can change in an instant.

341
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Look at that.

342
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I've never seen such a dirty grey cloud as that.

343
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh, here it comes!

344
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Let's get water quick before this happens.

345
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Can you pass me the bottle one by one and pass them over to me?

346
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Violent Pacific storms can dump an inch of water in an hour.

347
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,240
The women need to take their chances when they can.

348
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

349
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
We need to try and protect the fire!

350
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
The wood's getting saturated.

351
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

352
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

353
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

354
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

355
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
They're using trunks to protect the water.

356
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Congratulations.

357
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,240
They're using Georgie's poncho to save the fire,

358
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
but half the group has tied up trying to collect rainwater.

359
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
I can't fucking believe this.

360
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I can't think it's organised when they feed.

361
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Oh, hello, piggies!

362
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Oh, they're getting sheltered.

363
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Oh, it's cooking itself, really.

364
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
They're going to roast themselves.

365
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Let them roast themselves.

366
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Is that a tornado?

367
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Wow.

368
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Do you want to see what's inside?

369
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
So, there it goes.

370
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
It's like a big thing in the sky.

371
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Honestly, I've never seen anything like it.

372
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
If that touches down, we're in trouble.

373
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Oh, my God.

374
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,240
At their worst, water tornadoes are capable of travelling up to 150 miles an hour.

375
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,240
If this hits the island, it could destroy everything in its path.

376
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
It's like one of those.

377
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
It's growing as well.

378
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
It is growing.

379
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
That's pretty scary.

380
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
We're really vulnerable here and no-one can get through anything like that happens.

381
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Well, hang on.

382
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Is it dissipating or is it just curving?

383
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
It's gone.

384
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
It seems to have just split up and gone.

385
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
We'll get to live another day.

386
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Shame.

387
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,240
While they've kept the fire alight, they've hardly collected any water.

388
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Is that the total amount of what we've just got from that rainfall?

389
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Yeah.

390
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,240
I am struggling.

391
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,240
As much as we nest here, Mother Nature turns up and she just shits on it.

392
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,240
And it's like a fucking mudslide everywhere now.

393
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
It's become clear to the women they can't survive here on Coconut Beach.

394
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
They must move camp.

395
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Whoa!

396
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Five days ago, the women discovered a beach on the western side of the island

397
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,240
with a sustainable water source nearby.

398
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
They christened it Home Beach.

399
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Now, Lauren wants to take everyone back there.

400
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
You need to get to that Home Beach now.

401
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
The beach, the water...

402
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,240
It's just going to make people feel like they can actually do this.

403
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm pretty confident in where that beach is.

404
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
We do have a serious problem with water.

405
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Hopefully, Home Beach is going to sort all that out.

406
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
There's a stream there.

407
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah, and this is the, like, resources.

408
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
We can start making our shelters.

409
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
You guys haven't seen it.

410
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
You guys haven't seen it yet either, have you?

411
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,240
So, I've got this image of this beach that flows for, like, miles.

412
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Palm trees, hammocks, shelter, waterfall, fish jumping from the sea.

413
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Yeah, we saw that. We did see that.

414
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Oh, I'm so excited.

415
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
What's the plan with the fire, guys?

416
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Are we going to try and transport it?

417
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
We haven't got anything metal, have we, yet?

418
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
So, we'll just have to light another one.

419
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
It's all right, we're experts now.

420
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm excited. It's going to be eight.

421
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Who would like the first snail?

422
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Sage and onion remain off the menu.

423
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Tonight, it's just foraged snails.

424
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,240
It's quite salty, quite meaty,

425
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
and then there's this sharp, like, shit, basically.

426
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
And a good meal always prompts a lively conversation.

427
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Is that it? That's it.

428
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
It's small.

429
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
I had the South African with the tiny little penis.

430
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,240
It was definitely a micro-penis because it was smaller than my pinky.

431
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
No, like, you know...

432
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I said it was smaller than my pinky!

433
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
No, seriously, Beth, it's not even funny.

434
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I really feel for them because no girl could feel that inside them.

435
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Can you imagine?

436
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
So, what's the point?

437
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,240
One guy who I was dating just felt like a little twiglet.

438
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
The good thing is that they're often really good at cunnilingus.

439
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
And then you have to get special condoms

440
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,240
because they're so small and it's just going to slip off otherwise.

441
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Do you actually get special condoms for them?

442
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
You can, yeah.

443
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
6.30am, day nine.

444
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Honestly adorable.

445
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm saying this about a pig.

446
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Oh, and they're very cute. It just made me happy.

447
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Today, the women face an arduous trek,

448
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
seeking the beach where they want to build a permanent camp.

449
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
What do you think, Jamie?

450
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Is it worth cracking these open to get a mouthful of coconut before we set off?

451
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
No, no, it's too heavy. There's loads there.

452
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Oh, I really want a coconut. I'm so hungry.

453
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm so hungry, but someone's just said no.

454
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,240
I want you to just take your backpack off and I'm going to give it to Jamie.

455
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
It's a hard walk and you will find it difficult.

456
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
With very little water for the trek,

457
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Abi and Belinda are especially concerned about PhD student Fran.

458
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I know she's not well, but she doesn't want to leave.

459
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
It's really tricky, isn't it?

460
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
She doesn't want to make a fuss and she doesn't want to stop this.

461
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I just want to leave the island.

462
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Five days ago, she collapsed and received emergency medical treatment.

463
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
I'm really worried about Fran.

464
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Every time she tries to do something, she's feeling light-headed and dizzy.

465
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
She's already passed out once due to low blood sugar,

466
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
so clearly her body's not very good at adapting to the day.

467
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Shall we make you the bow carrier?

468
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
It's actually the most important thing ever.

469
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Yes.

470
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I feel like the weakest person in the group,

471
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,240
because everyone, even though they're really tired, they can keep going.

472
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,240
As I've said before, I just feel like another mouth to feed.

473
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Guys!

474
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Oh, no! No! No!

475
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Havala is reluctant to leave Sage and Onion behind.

476
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Now is time, Gordon.

477
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Come out!

478
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
OK, we'll just grab him.

479
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
They're wild animals. They just need to be left alone.

480
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I wanted to try.

481
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
We can't take the pits.

482
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Guys, we're going to Home Beach!

483
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Woo!

484
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Bye, Sage! Bye, Onion!

485
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Bye, dinner! Bye, lunch!

486
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Look at us! We look like savannahs!

487
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
BOOM!

488
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
BOOM!

489
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
BOOM!

490
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
BOOM!

491
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
BOOM!

492
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
9am.

493
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
The women depart for Home Beach.

494
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,240
The last time they went into the jungle, they were lost for three days.

495
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
We're going down, Lauren.

496
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
This time, 25-year old nurse Lauren leads the way.

497
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Then we're just going to head on this ridge thing.

498
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Julie, how are you feeling?

499
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Fuck off!

500
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Fuck off?

501
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Yeah. That's how I'm feeling.

502
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Woo!

503
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
After just half an hour, Becky's in trouble.

504
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Hold up, guys. I've just got a dry mouth.

505
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
My water bottle allocation for the day is almost done.

506
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
How's everyone doing?

507
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Energy level's zero.

508
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,240
The move will eat into the women's fragile energy reserves,

509
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,240
but it's a gamble they must take, whatever the consequences.

510
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Take five.

511
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm feeling so shit.

512
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
If this rain keeps on going,

513
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
I feel like I'm on the brink of collapsing again.

514
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I don't want to tell anyone cos I feel so pathetic.

515
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I know I can do this.

516
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I just need to keep going.

517
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,240
With the group exhausted, Lauren and Fi volunteer to scout ahead.

518
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Anyone want a biscuit?

519
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Oh, my God! Oh, you bitch!

520
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Just a little biscuit. Just a little barbie biscuit.

521
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Oh.

522
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,240
The advance party are pushing ahead through the jungle.

523
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
I think we may have found it.

524
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,240
We have! This is it!

525
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I know. This is our beach!

526
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Oh, my God. So excited.

527
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I feel a surge of energy.

528
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I can hear the sea!

529
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Oh, wow!

530
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Wow! That is amazing.

531
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Woo!

532
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Woo!

533
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Woo!

534
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Look at that!

535
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Even in the pisto drain, this place looks ridiculous.

536
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I just think paradise compared to where we've been.

537
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
The sea looks bluer. Everything looks better. Everything.

538
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Our pigs! The pigs!

539
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Yay!

540
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
They've traipsed all that way after us.

541
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I don't know whether I could eat them now.

542
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Oh!

543
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Aw!

544
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Why the king? They love us!

545
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
What the hell?

546
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Ketchup.

547
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I found a ketchup bottle, and I just think that's a sign.

548
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Mm-hm.

549
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Open ketchup.

550
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Ketchup.

551
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
The journey has beaten Fran.

552
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,240
This beach is extra cold because it's kind of, like, open.

553
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
I don't feel like I can do anything in this weather

554
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
because I can't move.

555
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
It's a little bit damp.

556
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Oh, thank you so much, hubby.

557
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Aw, I love you.

558
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Coming through the jungle again today,

559
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,240
in pouring rain, has tipped her over the edge.

560
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,240
She's been proper poorly. She's cold all the time.

561
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,240
And so when we're cold, it's, for her, it's like bloody hypothermia.

562
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
When you're wet, you're malnourished,

563
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,240
your body temperature just is going to drop,

564
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
and it only takes a two-degree drop

565
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,240
to take you right bang into that danger zone for hypothermia.

566
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,240
So the women have an uphill struggle getting Fran warm.

567
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,240
I am on firewood duty.

568
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,240
We need to get dry firewood.

569
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Nothing is dry.

570
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
There's just no dry standing wood.

571
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
It's not a little bit wet.

572
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Honestly, the place is just soddenly hoarse.

573
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't feel that I could cope with another rainstorm.

574
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,240
I don't think I'm medically fit for this.

575
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
It really is torture for Fran.

576
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,240
She clearly is not a well person.

577
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,240
I don't even have any sort of rescue meds,

578
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
so if she were to collapse,

579
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
it would take a while to get any further medical help to us.

580
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
What's up, brother?

581
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Fran now feels she has no option.

582
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,240
My body can't take it anymore. Over.

583
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Do you then want to kick off the island?

584
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Yes, please. Over.

585
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I hope you feel so much better, honey.

586
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,240
I think you might have died if you stayed.

587
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
And I'm serious.

588
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Thank you.

589
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I think I would as well.

590
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
I am absolutely gutted.

591
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
I absolutely love Fran.

592
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
She's ace.

593
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
She's our little baby.

594
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
It was going to be my first challenge ever.

595
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
But I, for myself, did.

596
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,240
And I'm really gutted that I couldn't complete it.

597
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
It's kind of heartbreaking.

598
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
I tried so hard.

599
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Fran, bye, my darling.

600
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
We love you.

601
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
We love you.

602
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Another one down.

603
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Now we need to go and anchor the others to trees

604
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
and make sure none of the others are thinking of leaving.

605
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
To lose another team member, it's so demoralising.

606
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,240
And you can just feel the atmosphere in camp at the minute

607
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
is just on tenterhooks and everyone's thinking,

608
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
I don't know how long I can keep going like this.

609
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Look at this shit.

610
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
I know.

611
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
What the hell's gone on?

612
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,240
The storm and an extreme high tide

613
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
have washed up a potential treasure trove.

614
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Like Paradise Beach, no longer.

615
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh!

616
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh!

617
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
False alarm, half a hair clip.

618
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Ta-da!

619
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Not only is it a can, it's a can with a lid.

620
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,240
I think one of the real unsung heroes in the survivors' arsenal

621
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
is resourcefulness.

622
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
What's that?

623
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Is that iron brew?

624
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Oh, my God.

625
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Oh, my God.

626
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
I thought it was iron brew.

627
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Oh, my God.

628
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Here, here, hold that, hold that.

629
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I thought it was iron brew.

630
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Oh, my God.

631
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Wait, check the cell by day.

632
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I don't care.

633
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, my God.

634
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Oh, my God.

635
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
Shh.

636
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Oh, my God.

637
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
So powerfully sweet.

638
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
So sugary, like, set up.

639
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,240
And it was just heaven, absolute heaven.

640
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
It actually just dropped on my tongue

641
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,240
and it felt like ecstasy, absolute ecstasy.

642
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,240
The women hope the wood is now dry enough

643
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
to somehow light a fire

644
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
to purify the water from a nearby pond.

645
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
This is filled up good.

646
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Thank God for that.

647
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Yeah, for some reason.

648
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Thank God.

649
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Oh, my God.

650
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Oh, my God!

651
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
It's usually on a fire starter.

652
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Woo!

653
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Hang on, hang on.

654
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Hang on.

655
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Wait, hold on, we haven't lit a fire yet.

656
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
This is, like, so early.

657
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Please don't go out.

658
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Please don't go out.

659
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
To fucking wet.

660
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Shit, what are we going to do?

661
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Oh, my God.

662
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Oh, my God.

663
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Oh, my God.

664
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Oh, my God.

665
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Oh, my God.

666
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Oh, my God.

667
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Oh, my God.

668
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Oh, my God.

669
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Oh, my God.

670
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Oh, my God.

671
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Oh, my God.

672
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Oh, my God.

673
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh, my God.

674
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Oh, my God.

675
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Shit, what we're going to do?

676
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Good work, Georgie.

677
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Nothing happens without a fire.

678
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
We've got those things.

679
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
It's, it's, it's...

680
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
I can't believe how...

681
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
It's an inverted triangle.

682
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Yeah.

683
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Fire.

684
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
And everything comes off with a truck of fire.

685
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
That's it.

686
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Without fire, we are...

687
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I don't have any survival skills, but I'm absolutely happy to step up to the plate if

688
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,240
a crocodile needs killing, or...

689
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Yeah.

690
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,160
snake needs its head chopping off and I think the key to our survival on the

691
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,220
island is teamwork I was actually caught in the tsunami in Sri Lanka we didn't

692
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,940
eat or sleep for four days so I have an understanding of what that mental

693
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,140
pressure is

694
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,680
my stopping enough pressure on it I think I'm not putting enough pressure on

695
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,600
it harder she tries Georgie can't get it to

696
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:33,820
light even now the wood is drier sup Jules it's half past two now no sign of

697
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,180
the fire

698
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:51,700
he's had any spindle left is the thing it's probably right flicking off nice

699
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,240
and slow that's it keep it like that the battle

700
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,580
for an

701
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,360
ember continues through the night

702
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,940
getting a little bit panic we're starving and thirsty I surely I'm gonna

703
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,320
die soon fucking stupid place the women have now been without water for more

704
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,020
than 48 hours and they are dangerously dehydrated I feel really drained and

705
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,360
really faint

706
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm dead

707
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,360
okay to you Lauren

708
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360

709
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,360
yeah me

710
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
fucker

711
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
it wasn't like that

712
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,360
I think we've lost this one haven't we

713
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,140
so this bow drill set really all the parts need to be in perfect proportion

714
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,140
for this to work the problem is the women's drill is now too small because

715
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,880
it's been so used they need to start again their situation is now beyond

716
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,520
critical

717
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,780
feel so dizzy it's fucking hard work when you've not drunk anything and the

718
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,260
heat

719
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm really struggling it feels like a purpose on this island it's just to be

720
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
dehydrated

721
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,780
just to be dehydrated

722
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,000
it's just a bit dehydrated

723
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm so tired.

724
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Pot shot to barbell one, over.

725
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I just wanted to let you know we need some supplies from you.

726
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Medical advice is that the castaways

727
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
are now so critically dehydrated that within a few hours,

728
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
their lives will genuinely be in danger.

729
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So, really, I've got no choice but to intervene,

730
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and the women will be given a working bow drill set.

731
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Right, fire startings, bitters.

732
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Let's do this.

733
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's purring, ladies, it's purring, actually.

734
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, yes!

735
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes! Woo-hoo!

736
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Woo-hoo!

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well done!

738
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
This is amazing, isn't it?

739
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This is great.

740
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Woo!

741
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Now we can start thinking about the bigger things,

742
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
like our bellies, for example.

743
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There's a little something down there

744
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
which is sitting a bit dangerously close to the fire to me.

745
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is amazing.

746
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's cool and clear.

747
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And that view, I feel like we're in a luxury hotel.

748
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And then, shortly, our butler will come.

749
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What have you ordered for butler service?

750
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, oysters.

751
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Oh, no, not oysters. We can get them here.

752
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, yeah!

753
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Order something you can't get here.

754
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What would be your first?

755
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Double cheeseburger.

756
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Absolute whopper with everything on it.

757
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I want to find out what you...

758
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Now, what have you ordered from our butler?

759
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
From our room service.

760
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I've started with some deep...

761
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, sorry, it is seafood, actually.

762
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No, really?

763
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Some deep-fried calamari.

764
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Deep-fried calamari.

765
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh.

766
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then, for some weird reason,

767
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
it's a bit like being pregnant,

768
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want jelly and custard and ice cream.

769
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And I don't even like ice cream.

770
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But I'd like, you know, jelly, custard and ice cream.

771
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And then, a kids' buffet.

772
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh, kids' buffet. I'm with you with that.

773
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Until I vomit.

774
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Day 12 on the island.

775
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The women now have fire and plenty of drinking water,

776
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but they're barely surviving on just 50 calories a day.

777
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It took me I don't know how many hours

778
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
to get that many almonds.

779
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's going to be one almond, if we're lucky.

780
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
After almost two weeks without a meal,

781
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the group is at the point of starvation.

782
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If they don't eat soon, there's a genuine risk

783
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
their organs will start to shut down.

784
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm fucking hungry.

785
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
My tummy has gone away.

786
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I literally have no tummy.

787
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Look.

788
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.

789
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
My stomach's going, I'm going to have to eat myself.

790
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is that not the cutest thing you've ever seen?

791
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Hi, Sage and Onion.

792
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The fate of Sage and Onion hangs in the balance.

793
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The women have befriended them

794
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and now can't agree whether or not

795
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to eat them.

796
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I keep looking at those gorgeous pigs

797
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
as bits of food.

798
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
They're too cute.

799
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We can't, I can't.

800
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now, imagine this.

801
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Barbecue sauce over the ribs, right?

802
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, barbecue sauce, right?

803
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Even the tail, really good, really chewy,

804
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'd still eat it.

805
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think we should spit roast it.

806
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Put a steak up through its bum.

807
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Not through its mouth, through its head, of course.

808
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Obviously, I've got a completely different point of view

809
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
to the rest of the girls.

810
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Because I don't eat meat, but...

811
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Sage and Onion, they're little peglets

812
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and definitely not eating none.

813
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We've got two pigs, Sage and Onion,

814
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
which have become our pet pigs.

815
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
They've followed us all the way from Coconut Beach here,

816
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
which is a long walk for little legs.

817
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They were thriving at the other beach.

818
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What's lacking here that they could get at the other beach?

819
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They were digging up lots of roots at the other beach.

820
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was really muddy,

821
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
so the water collected in the mud was in the sand.

822
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Water doesn't really collect.

823
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We have to set a limit to how much we do

824
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
that compromises our resources over the pigs.

825
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Over the past few days,

826
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
people have been laid down with double vision,

827
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
retching and not being able to walk.

828
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
People are really suffering,

829
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and you need to eat to survive.

830
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Nobody wants to kill anything, but we need to eat.

831
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Understandably, you know, a lot of people find the hard work,

832
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
the whole concept of killing animals,

833
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
it's either cruel, it's upsetting,

834
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and, yes, it's never pleasant to take a life,

835
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but in a survival situation, when it comes down to the wire,

836
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it's a simple choice, them or you.

837
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You're really upset, everybody's really upset.

838
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Can we show of hands that we agree that we do something soon?

839
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So, Jamie, where's your mind thinking at the moment?

840
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't want anything to do with this.

841
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Well, who's going to kill it?

842
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, that's the next question.

843
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I have volunteered myself to do it...

844
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well done, Lauren.

845
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
..just because I know that I'll do it fast.

846
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm going to get a little dehydrated, so I'll have a little drink.

847
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
He's crying out more than he's taken it.

848
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, that's all right.

849
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You see, it was wrong to all get attached to them, wasn't it?

850
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I always say, once you've named something, you're screwed.

851
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.

852
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The reason I'm so upset

853
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
is because they reminded me of my dog.

854
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And...

855
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
..I really thought we were going to have some

856
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
until we left the island.

857
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It makes everything real.

858
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It makes everything...

859
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
..like...

860
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
..raw.

861
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's pretty raw, isn't it? Yes!

862
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's raw.

863
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Erm, I just want to make it the most, like, peaceful...

864
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
..death.

865
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You know, like, if I was panicking,

866
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
then it would feel that.

867
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
If anyone sees a good whacker...

868
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm not annoyed at anybody.

869
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I just don't want to have any part of it.

870
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
As long as I don't see it or hear it,

871
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
it just stops it.

872
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Just gently holding out,

873
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
cos I don't want him to struggle,

874
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I just want him to be relaxed.

875
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But I tell you what,

876
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
they've had a little better life than most pigs in captivity

877
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
that have bred to the pork.

878
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The pork we eat and the chops I buy

879
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and the sausages I buy,

880
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
they've had no life at all.

881
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't know another pig that's gone to bed with a load of people.

882
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Ready? Should race.

883
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Absolutely. Yeah.

884
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
One, two, three.

885
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THEY LAUGH

886
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, Lauren, absolutely amazingly well done.

887
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You did the job really, really well. Really well.

888
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It was quick. Quick.

889
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And it was painless.

890
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That was pretty emotional, wasn't it?

891
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It was pretty horrible.

892
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's never easy to take a life,

893
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
but having learnt from this first kill,

894
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
they actually dispatched the second animal swiftly, cleanly,

895
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
no hesitation.

896
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't distress.

897
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Shall we get it back and get it on the barbecue?

898
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I've never, ever killed an animal before,

899
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
especially as a girl, as well,

900
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
is that I don't think we're designed to want to kill anything,

901
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and that's what has been a huge limit

902
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
on the burning curve for me.

903
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You know, it's reality.

904
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That's what it is, it's brutal reality,

905
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
that if you want to eat,

906
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
then you are going to have to kill something.

907
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Gosh, Lauren, she's...

908
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
She was the first to volunteer for the pig.

909
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
She's very matter-of-fact, very hard-working.

910
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Actually, if I could channel a little bit of Lauren,

911
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'd be very happy, because she's very impressive.

912
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
We needed something that was going to kick-start us

913
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
into not viewing animals as pets,

914
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
but rather as a way that is going to allow us to survive.

915
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
You know, it's going to give us the energy that we need

916
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
to get hunting, get finding water, to find wood,

917
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
because that is all exhausting work.

918
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's very sad, but if I'm perfectly, perfectly honest,

919
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm really looking forward to the meat,

920
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
because I think we're all in dire need of a bit of a meal.

921
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Harvey, just to let you know, the pig's on the fire.

922
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm not being a hypocrite. I'll look later.

923
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm just not ready. Thank you.

924
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There's no way I'm going to end here until it's all done with.

925
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I wouldn't go in there. I'm not eating a pig.

926
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This is a really decisive moment

927
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
in a women's struggle for survival.

928
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now they have the mindset to progress as hunters and killers.

929
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
They've actually crossed a very important cycle

930
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
and a very important psychological line,

931
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and for the first time, they're behaving like survivors.

932
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Are you ready, guys?

933
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

934
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
This tastes good.

935
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh, my God. It's unbelievably delicious.

936
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't like the fact that I'm eating the piggy, but it is good.

937
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like a wild animal.

938
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SHE LAUGHS

939
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Like a cavewoman.

940
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Do you know what that tube is? It's a testicle.

941
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I don't know. I quite like things like that.

942
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Do you know what I mean? It's quite savage.

943
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We needed that.

944
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm not going to lie.

945
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It was gorgeous.

946
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Erm, I could have ate it all myself.

947
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's all good.

948
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's it for now. Over and out.

949
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Next time on The Island...

950
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You lazy bunch of bone-idle bastards!

951
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We're not even halfway through and tensions are beginning to fray.

952
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We're not all just grunts that bash on bits of wood.

953
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The sun would look like you didn't want to do a harder job.

954
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I would say, fuck you to that person.

955
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Fucking calm down, eh?

956
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There is absolutely no food in this camp.

957
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This island is infested.

958
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Gee-bye!

959
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Roundy boy!

960
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Shit!
