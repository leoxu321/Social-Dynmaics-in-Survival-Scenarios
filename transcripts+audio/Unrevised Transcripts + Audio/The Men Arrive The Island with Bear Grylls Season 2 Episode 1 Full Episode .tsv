0	14700	two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14
14700	24180	British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women when pushed to the limits of
24180	32520	human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the winds a day who will have what it
32520	45600	takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men Britain today we've never been further from a
45600	53820	hunter-gatherer origins but I want to know when stripped of everything
54180	57360	has modern man still got that instinct to survive
59760	66600	to find out a marooning 14 ordinary men on a desert island this is crazy this is absolutely
66600	72060	crazy this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever
75360	80400	they'll have to endure six weeks in the height of the harsh tropical storm season
80400	83640	this is the worst you can do
84180	90540	they'll be utterly alone filming everything themselves we have two choices one we go down
90540	99600	the 40-foot Ravine holy well we keep going through this of a jungle they'll have to find their own
99600	109260	water and hunt for their own food we've just got a prehistoric animal you lazy bunch of bone idle
109260	113820	bastards have these modern day men got what it takes to survive
114180	123540	that's the hardest thing I've done
137520	144120	I personally don't think men are as strong now as they were I wouldn't even say 50 years ago even
144180	150300	five years ago because we have it too easy the interesting question to ask actually is if we
150300	155880	lost everything what would happen to us it'd be nice to think I've come off the island feeling
155880	161880	a little bit more macho a little bit more alpha male a little bit more popular with the ladies
163560	168960	I'm about to abandon these men on a remote Pacific island to see if they can survive
170340	173820	they will be utterly alone my oldest was 19.
174180	177900	he only needs me for money in a lift and the youngest one's too cool to hang around with
177900	183060	dad my dream is for them guys to go that's my dad that that's fantastic my dad did that
184860	189360	I don't think I've done anything that's put myself at risk really but I'm scared he's
189360	192840	taking a graphic designer on an island with no other skills whatsoever anything could happen
193860	199680	these 14 ordinary men do not know each other and they have no experience in living in the wild
200760	203640	at the moment I don't enjoy day-to-day life
204180	208560	I've got a stressful job I've got a newborn baby at home I want to go on the island to
208560	214260	get away from the day-to-day I think everyone in life does take certain things for
214260	218460	granted electricity when you turn on the light having a warm shower having breakfast when it's
218460	223140	not there and you wake up in the morning and go where's the next meal coming from it's a man test
223140	231660	isn't it okay guys we're getting closer you are very remote here the next stop that way is New Zealand
234180	240900	out is has all of this cushioning that civilization has experienced over the last 50 years made us
240900	247740	totally lose touch with that survival instinct that I believe is deep within us all okay guys
247740	254040	I need you to be my eyes for any rocks and loads of rocks it takes an extreme situation to find out
254040	262560	what people are really made of what you're about to embark on it will be the toughest thing you will
264180	272640	do this all right you can do it the men's home for the next six weeks is an uninhabited island
272640	279900	in a remote Pacific archipelago the 11 kilometers of coastline is dominated by treacherous cliffs and
279900	288700	rocky headlands vicious swells and powerful ocean currents means there's no easy way onto
288700	293580	the island I'm gonna try and get you guys as close as I can all right
294180	301680	but you will end up swimming any of you guys are weak swimmers it is a good time to say I've never
301680	306480	swam this distance before not even a swimming pool but I will get there I will get there age won't
306480	313320	stop me doing this not often in one's life someone actually challenges your morals challenges you
313320	318900	physically and this does that's why I want to do it who can't swim confidently confident with
318900	320520	unconfident yeah let's go
324180	328680	the men must make the 75 meter swim to the island fully closed
329640	334080	help each other help those who are weaker let's go let's go
335880	342480	strong undercurrents mean the men need to get to shore as quickly as possible
348840	351060	go get out of the water go go go
354180	360400	out of the water go see if they can
365520	370020	wow that was the damnedest thing I ever did
376740	379680	I couldn't have gone much further but that's only a taste of what we've got to come then bring it children yeah well the advice is
379680	381680	take your own piss which is a bit unnerving with only two days survival training initiative will be key
381680	383980	essentially it's water isn't it is that your favorite��요
384180	386180	You've got to save your piss, mate. You've got to save your piss.
386180	388180	Yeah, yeah. Save your piss.
388180	390180	Drink your own piss!
390180	392180	I hope not.
392180	395180	So, they look a bit like a party of drowned rats at the moment.
395180	397180	Kind of let the chaos begin.
397180	401180	But what I do know is, when I return in six weeks' time,
401180	404180	the 14 men, if there are still 14 men there,
404180	407180	which, to be honest, I doubt,
407180	409180	the men that do remain...
409180	411180	..will be changed.
411180	414180	It's time for me and the crew to leave.
414180	417180	We won't be back until the end of the experiment.
419180	421180	For the next six weeks,
421180	424180	the men will have to live entirely on their own wits.
425180	429180	To make sure these men at least have a fighting chance at survival,
429180	431180	I've ensured the island's got enough water,
431180	435180	indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive.
435180	437180	It's teeming with wildlife.
437180	440180	But what they've got to have is the ingenuity
440180	441180	to find it,
441180	442180	catch it and kill it.
442180	444180	What's your name, mate?
444180	445180	Paul.
445180	446180	I'm Ross.
446180	447180	Hello, Ross.
447180	448180	From here on in,
448180	451180	everything you see will be filmed by the men themselves.
451180	454180	Why don't we get everybody together
454180	458180	and then we'll work out something that we're going to do
458180	460180	and then we're all going to be heading that way,
460180	461180	I'm assuming, anyway,
461180	463180	because it looks a little bit safer than this,
463180	465180	cos it'll be dark soon.
465180	468180	Come on, lads, let's make use of some of this energy while we've got it.
468180	470180	All of the men will film,
470180	474180	but four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.
474180	475180	I'm Ross.
475180	476180	Sam.
476180	477180	How you doing, mate?
477180	481180	Who'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.
481180	484180	Oh, I'm like a fucking mule arse, aren't I?
484180	486180	The brains of a donkey!
486180	490180	Obviously, because we are having to film everything ourselves,
490180	494180	we've got to cart all of the camera gear, batteries and everything with us.
494180	495180	Let's do it.
495180	497180	Let's get on with it.
497180	499180	For fuck's sake, this is survival, not Good Morning Britain.
500180	503180	As well as the camera equipment, they'll have a medical kit,
503180	506180	two jerry cans containing a day's supply of water,
506180	510180	basic fishing equipment and a handful of tools.
510180	512180	Guys, how many knives do we have? Let's count them in.
512180	514180	Three knives, three machetes.
514180	515180	Three knives, that's easy.
515180	517180	So, I'll gather round in one group, guys.
517180	520180	I'm Barney and I'm a paramedic from Leicester.
522180	524180	I'm Andy Bennett, builder for Milton Keynes.
524180	526180	We've got a fucking builder, everybody!
527180	529180	Let's hope he's not a cowboy.
530180	532180	My name's Piers, I am a doctor.
534180	537180	I'm Kyle and I'm a website consultant.
541180	544180	My name's Paul, I invented the dice.
548180	550180	I'm a construction contract manager.
551180	555180	It's 4pm. With only two hours of daylight remaining,
555180	559180	the men's priority has to be finding a safe place to shelter for the night.
561180	565180	If they can't, they'll have to sleep rough on the jungle floor,
565180	569180	alongside potentially deadly scorpions, snakes and caiman crocodiles.
571180	574180	We're assuming that the north side of the island
574180	577180	would be nice beachy, sandy, flat seas.
577180	580180	Paul thinks the group's best option is a beach.
580180	581180	Let's go.
582180	584180	And he's convinced they have time to cross the island
584180	586180	to find one before dark.
586180	589180	Who else was imagining sunny beaches
589180	591180	when they thought about coming out here?
591180	593180	These trees here are very sharp.
594180	596180	There you go.
596180	599180	I believe it will now be referred to as the porcupine tree.
599180	600180	Vicious.
602180	605180	The interior of the island is three square kilometres
605180	608180	of mangrove swamp and unbroken jungle.
608180	610180	And I know from experience
610180	612180	that moving through dense island undergrowth
612180	614180	is a slow, exhausting work.
614180	617180	It will do all you can to stop you in your tracks.
617180	621180	And often, the harder you push, the harder it pushes back.
621180	623180	Whoa! Stop!
625180	627180	There's a snake down here.
627180	628180	It's a boa, isn't it?
628180	630180	Take its head off if it's a decent size, mate.
630180	631180	Get stuck in.
631180	632180	Is anyone going to help me?
632180	635180	I'm trying to carry a bag and a machete and kill a snake.
635180	638180	He's looking pretty aggressive. He's coiling, isn't he?
638180	641180	I need a long stick just to put on its head.
642180	643180	Mind you, no snake.
643180	644180	Mind you...
644180	647180	No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that, for fuck's sake.
647180	649180	Listen, should we just throw this case on it?
649180	650180	No.
650180	652180	Part of me thinks, should we just leave it?
652180	654180	Didn't even flinch, did it?
655180	657180	Yeah, yeah, let's keep going.
659180	661180	If we don't get out of this shrub,
661180	663180	we're going to be sleeping here tonight.
663180	665180	It ain't safe and it's not cool.
666180	668180	With just an hour to go until nightfall,
668180	671180	the men have covered barely 400 metres.
671180	672180	Paul!
672180	673180	Yes?
673180	675180	You going to come and get a drink?
675180	676180	The darker it's getting,
676180	678180	the more it's getting a little bit worrying.
678180	679180	Tap on it when you're done.
679180	682180	Somehow I've fallen into chief navigator mode,
682180	683180	but I'm on it.
685180	687180	My days are very stressful.
687180	689180	It really doesn't fucking matter.
689180	690180	I don't give a fuck.
690180	693180	A lot of the time I think that most people are fucking idiots.
693180	695180	Just get that load out, get that load out.
695180	697180	You can't build the internal walls anyway.
697180	701180	Being called a bastard is just a friendly greeting
701180	703180	in the building industry.
703180	705180	Get in there and get it done.
705180	708180	This experience might change me.
708180	710180	Hopefully for the better.
710180	713180	It might make me be a little bit more tolerant of other people.
713180	715180	Come on, fuckers.
715180	717180	This is going to take us fucking hours.
717180	719180	Yeah, it's about to get darker and darker as well.
719180	722180	Yeah, I know, so that's why we've just got to get through it.
722180	723180	We need to start to think,
723180	725180	do we want to be hacking through this stuff
725180	726180	when it's pitch black,
726180	728180	or the next time we see a clearing,
728180	730180	are we going to think about settling down for the night?
730180	733180	Mate, I personally want to just plough on and make it.
733180	735180	I mean, it's going to get darker in here
735180	737180	quicker than it is on the beach.
737180	739180	I say we plough on.
739180	741180	This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy.
744180	746180	I don't know what to say right now.
749180	751180	I never had the money to go travelling.
751180	753180	I've never done anything that's been a bit sort of edgy,
753180	755180	that's been a bit...
756180	758180	..dangerous, I guess.
758180	760180	I don't think I'm as confident as I was
760180	761180	as I say I am,
761180	764180	and I think a lot of what I do can be a front.
764180	767180	The sort of persona of alpha male to me
767180	769180	is everything my stepdad was.
769180	772180	I saw enough of him growing up to realise who not to be.
772180	775180	I guess it's time to find out who I really am.
775180	778180	Keep coming! We're only 100 metres away!
779180	782180	It keeps saying it's like the beach is 100 metres away.
782180	784180	It's all getting a little bit pissed off
784180	786180	because we've been walking for about fucking miles
786180	787180	and it's not here.
787180	789180	The temperatures are freeing.
790180	794180	It's like 51-year-old builder Andy is struggling to keep up.
794180	796180	At the moment, it's like every man for himself.
797180	798180	For fuck's sake.
801180	802180	First.
802180	803180	Cut.
807180	809180	We've not even made any ground
809180	812180	and we are all...fucked.
813180	816180	Joe, pop Randy and help you.
816180	819180	He's got a really awkward box on his arm.
819180	820180	I know it's a ball-legged kid,
820180	822180	but you're carrying one of the fucking easiest things in the world.
822180	823180	I'm a fuck.
823180	824180	I know it's heavy.
824180	825180	I'm a fuck, pal. No, I'm not.
825180	826180	But it's easy.
826180	827180	You want to carry this bag?
827180	828180	It's fucked.
828180	830180	I'll swap you now, mate, if you want.
833180	838180	At the front, Paul pushes on, despite the group's growing descent.
839180	841180	Have we got lights in those cameras, Sam?
841180	842180	Bit of infrared.
842180	844180	How you doing, mate?
844180	845180	Some people ain't playing ball.
845180	847180	In what way? What do you mean?
847180	848180	Oh.
848180	850180	Cracking on with fuck all, you know?
851180	853180	We could all do that, like a hero with a machete.
853180	854180	Come on.
854180	855180	For fuck's sake.
855180	857180	I know we all want to get on, but...
858180	860180	you've got to think of everybody else now. We're a team.
860180	862180	You can't just be selfish, you know?
864180	865180	Oh, there's a bit of light, look.
867180	868180	This is amazing.
868180	869180	I've found the sea.
876180	877180	Ah.
878180	879180	Ah.
879180	882180	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
882180	883180	Oh.
883180	885180	Yeah, it's a good beach.
885180	886180	Come on.
886180	888180	Hooray, boys.
888180	889180	Come on.
889180	890180	Booyah.
890180	891180	Beach.
891180	892180	Ha, ha.
892180	893180	Pina coladas.
893180	894180	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
904180	906180	It's the hardest thing I've ever done.
908180	910180	Come on.
910180	911180	Come on.
911180	912180	Fuck.
915180	918180	I never thought I'd be so happy to see the beach in my entire life.
919180	920180	Well done, mate. Well done.
929180	930180	Fuck.
930180	931180	Nice one, mate.
936180	937180	Oh.
938180	939180	I never doubted myself.
939180	941180	Never underestimate your own abilities.
944180	947180	The sun's just beginning to set, so we're just in time.
947180	949180	And everyone is on such a high right now.
949180	950180	That's a whale.
950180	951180	It's a whale.
951180	952180	Wow.
952180	955180	Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
956180	960180	We're still there watching the sunset, and there's whales swimming past us.
960180	961180	Pretty cool.
961180	963180	You don't get that often, do you?
968180	970180	You're right.
970180	971180	About two minutes sleep, I think.
971180	972180	One time, huh?
973180	979180	16 hours ago, I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote desert island.
979180	982180	I haven't slept for a minute.
982180	984180	Not a minute.
984180	989180	They have spent their first night on the beach with no shelter.
989180	991180	Is that really shit?
991180	993180	Oh, what have we done?
993180	996180	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
996180	998180	You never get that realization.
998180	1001180	You've done something you didn't quite think all the way through.
1001180	1003180	At one point, I was shitting if we were going to get washed away.
1003180	1005180	I was like, did it get that close?
1005180	1007180	I mean, you can see the line, mate.
1007180	1008180	You can see the line.
1008180	1011180	The line's, what, three foot away from where we were?
1013180	1017180	Look at the amount of rubbish on this beach.
1017180	1019180	Has anyone found a left shoe?
1019180	1022180	Yeah, but these, I'm not too sure if I'm going to go for these.
1022180	1024180	What are you?
1024180	1025180	A bit last season.
1025180	1026180	Hey, lads.
1026180	1027180	Look.
1027180	1029180	Found a pink pair.
1029180	1031180	These are bloody comfortable.
1033180	1034180	Look at these bad boys.
1034180	1036180	This is the male version.
1040180	1045180	The men came onto the island with just a day's supply of drinking water.
1045180	1046180	Mouthfuls.
1046180	1052180	But after yesterday's arduous trek in 34-degree heat, it's all but gone.
1052180	1053180	Tropical storm season.
1053180	1055180	Really, there shouldn't be any shortage of water.
1055180	1058180	And obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.
1058180	1061180	But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.
1061180	1063180	All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.
1063180	1069180	From experience, I can tell you, animals aren't fussy about where they crap.
1069180	1071180	Oh, my God.
1071180	1073180	Look at all the crap that's in there.
1073180	1075180	That's fucking horrible.
1075180	1083180	Without boiling, this rancid water would almost certainly give the men stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
1083180	1085180	It's not salty, but...
1085180	1086180	I'll tell you what.
1086180	1088180	I've had hangover shits that smell better than that.
1088180	1089180	Guys, can we...
1089180	1094180	Why don't we all kind of gather in and have some sort of conflab about what we're going to do today?
1094180	1096180	Yeah, I think that might be a very good idea, please.
1096180	1097180	Go on, guys.
1097180	1098180	Gather round.
1098180	1099180	You want a plan of action, lads?
1099180	1100180	Yeah.
1100180	1103180	We 100% need to try and make a fire now.
1103180	1110180	If we don't make a fire and something to boil new water, we are going to be in bad shape by tomorrow morning.
1110180	1112180	Food is becoming a priority very quickly.
1112180	1117180	For a lot of people, we're going to have to get something substantial to eat fairly soon.
1117180	1118180	Right.
1118180	1120180	Meet and adjourn.
1120180	1122180	Shall we dance, sir?
1122180	1123180	Is that ready?
1123180	1124180	Let's go.
1124180	1126180	The men decide to split up.
1126180	1132180	Having eaten nothing since they arrived, the majority of the group head off to look for food,
1132180	1136180	while engineer Dan and builder Andy take on the fire lighting.
1136180	1139180	It's quite a lot of pressure to get this fire going.
1139180	1140180	You're down?
1140180	1141180	I'm up.
1141180	1142180	Yeah.
1142180	1143180	To me?
1143180	1144180	To me.
1144180	1145180	Awesome.
1145180	1147180	That is not an ideal start, is it?
1147180	1149180	That did one stroke.
1149180	1150180	Oh, lads.
1150180	1153180	I shot my load.
1153180	1158180	Round about here, there's about six, maybe ten snails and shit, yeah?
1158180	1165180	Along the coast, 47-year-old Vic has decided to put Joe, the group's youngest member, to work.
1165180	1167180	We should definitely have put some fucking shoes on.
1167180	1169180	That might have been a wise idea, fella.
1169180	1170180	Oh!
1170180	1171180	Just anything.
1171180	1173180	Limpets, crabs, give them a crack.
1173180	1174180	Snails.
1174180	1176180	You spot them, fella, and I'll club them.
1176180	1178180	Do these snails bite?
1178180	1181180	I feel as though something with legs is going to come out of there, innit?
1181180	1182180	A nippy.
1182180	1186180	Don't put your finger where you won't put your dick, because it might get bit.
1186180	1191180	And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the nearest we get to Michelin star.
1191180	1193180	Will we put it on a bed of anything?
1193180	1201180	One.
1201180	1206180	A morning's hard graft provides nothing more than a handful of limpets.
1216180	1217180	Give it a good old cheer.
1217180	1218180	Fucking hell.
1218180	1219180	Yeah.
1219180	1221180	Yeah, it's tough.
1221180	1222180	Limpets.
1222180	1224180	Limpets are horrendous.
1224180	1226180	You don't buy them in supermarkets, do you?
1226180	1228180	So they're not known for being very nice.
1228180	1230180	I don't think they're very nice at all.
1232180	1235180	For now, the men will have to go hungry.
1237180	1238180	Stop.
1239180	1241180	Who said there's no smoke without fire?
1241180	1243180	Lying bastards.
1243180	1245180	The fire's pissed me off a little bit.
1246180	1248180	I just don't know what we're doing wrong.
1249180	1252180	Lighting a fire has become an urgent priority.
1253180	1255180	It's 34 degrees in the shade,
1255180	1259180	and the men have had little to drink in the past 12 hours.
1259180	1261180	We've literally, we've got no water.
1261180	1262180	None at all?
1262180	1263180	None.
1263180	1265180	I had a piss 20 minutes ago,
1265180	1267180	and it was like pissing lion's golden syrup.
1267180	1268180	I had to push it out.
1273180	1275180	That is not viscous and clear.
1275180	1276180	No, it's definitely not.
1276180	1281180	The men are starting to show the telltale signs of serious dehydration.
1282180	1284180	Thirsty, really bloody thirsty.
1291180	1292180	Gone out of me.
1292180	1293180	I said, fuck off.
1295180	1297180	The vultures are circling already.
1298180	1299180	Look at the size of that.
1299180	1300180	Jesus.
1300180	1301180	That's prehistoric.
1302180	1303180	How about your glasses?
1303180	1304180	Do you reckon we can...
1304180	1305180	Can I try your glasses?
1305180	1306180	Try it, mate.
1306180	1307180	Yeah.
1307180	1309180	With their need for fire now critical,
1309180	1310180	web consultant Kyle,
1310180	1312180	has an idea he wants to try.
1313180	1315180	We've got Andy's glasses.
1315180	1318180	Just basically using the sun to focus at one point
1318180	1320180	is giving us quite a lot of heat.
1320180	1321180	Come on.
1322180	1323180	Come on.
1324180	1327180	Hoping that's going to work, the old glasses.
1330180	1331180	Let go, let go.
1334180	1336180	Oh, go on, Andy lad.
1336180	1337180	Sticks.
1337180	1338180	Get the little sticks.
1338180	1339180	Preparation.
1339180	1340180	Where's the next last stick?
1340180	1341180	Where's the rest of the shit?
1341180	1342180	Where's the rest of the stuff?
1342180	1343180	Sticks.
1343180	1344180	Fucking sticks.
1344180	1345180	Get up there.
1345180	1346180	Get up there.
1346180	1347180	Swipe right side.
1347180	1348180	Swipe right side.
1348180	1349180	All right.
1349180	1350180	Put it off.
1350180	1351180	Put it off.
1351180	1352180	Real tight.
1352180	1353180	Breathe it.
1353180	1354180	Go on, Andy.
1354180	1355180	Go on, son.
1355180	1356180	Go on, son.
1356180	1357180	Go on.
1357180	1358180	Slow.
1358180	1359180	Slow hard.
1359180	1360180	Slow hard.
1360180	1361180	He'll go.
1361180	1362180	Come on.
1362180	1363180	That's it.
1363180	1364180	Come on.
1364180	1365180	It's nigger there.
1365180	1366180	Keep going.
1366180	1367180	Keep going.
1367180	1368180	Keep going.
1368180	1369180	Keep going.
1369180	1370180	Sticks.
1370180	1371180	Twigs.
1371180	1372180	You got it.
1372180	1373180	The little twigs.
1373180	1374180	Yeah.
1374180	1375180	Twigs.
1375180	1376180	Yeah, twigs.
1376180	1377180	Found you.
1377180	1378180	Twigs.
1378180	1379180	Slowly, slowly.
1379180	1380180	Slowly, slowly, slowly.
1380180	1381180	Yeah.
1381180	1382180	There we go.
1382180	1383180	Bingo.
1383180	1384180	Well done, you two.
1384180	1385180	It was Kyle that started it.
1385180	1386180	Good.
1386180	1387180	Of course it was.
1387180	1388180	He showed me the way and I followed through.
1388180	1389180	I see.
1389180	1390180	We've done well.
1390180	1391180	We got there.
1391180	1392180	Absolutely brilliant.
1392180	1393180	Well done.
1393180	1394180	What a dark horse.
1394180	1395180	Excuse the pun.
1395180	1396180	We all take it back about the IT guy.
1397180	1398180	Fucking yes.
1398180	1399180	Well done, Kyle.
1399180	1408180	After eight hours of trying, the men finally have a fire on which to boil the stagnant water.
1408180	1412180	I'm going to drink and drink and drink until my piss falls clear.
1412180	1413180	And your verdict is?
1413180	1415180	I mean, it's almost like normal water.
1415180	1417180	There's a bit of sort of pond in there.
1417180	1419180	That is top notch.
1419180	1423180	It doesn't taste like piss, does it?
1423180	1425180	It tastes like metal weight tea.
1425180	1428180	As long as the fire stays lit, the men will have a source of safety.
1428180	1430180	They have a source of safe drinking water.
1430180	1431180	A little bit of that.
1431180	1432180	A little bit of that.
1432180	1433180	One achievement there.
1433180	1442180	But keeping it alight during tropical storm season will be a huge challenge.
1442180	1443180	Shit.
1443180	1444180	Look at that rain.
1444180	1446180	So look like right there, tropical paradise.
1446180	1447180	And then there.
1447180	1448180	Shit hole.
1448180	1449180	Shit hole.
1449180	1450180	It's like Waitrose and Aldi all in one picture.
1450180	1451180	What I'm worried about is that this hot shoe is still wet.
1451180	1452180	Oh shit.
1452180	1453180	Right here?
1453180	1454180	It's not wet.
1454180	1455180	It's just cold.
1455180	1456180	But it's not like the weather.
1456180	1457180	The temperature is protect us from cold.
1457180	1460420	What I'm worried about is everyone's off doing other things,
1460460	1463180	and in a minute, it's going to be pissing down with rain.
1463220	1467660	I actually think it'd be quite important to build a shelter for the fire.
1467700	1471340	I've not got the energy to build a shelter or anything at the moment.
1471380	1473140	If I could, I would, I promise you.
1474740	1476940	A little bit worried about Andy.
1476980	1481100	He seems to have separated himself from the group a little bit.
1481140	1482940	When everybody's together, he walks off.
1482980	1486740	He's now making a bed over there, which just seems a bit childish.
1486740	1489580	Feels like he doesn't want to be part of the group.
1489620	1491100	Hey, hey, I've got a bed.
1491140	1494100	All I want to do at the moment is get some sleep.
1494140	1495740	Just some, you know?
1499460	1501300	I think middle age has made me boring.
1501340	1504700	I've got a beautiful wife, lovely house, nice job, etc.
1504740	1507580	All the stuff that most people strive to get.
1507620	1509940	And yet I'm still searching for something.
1509980	1512180	Perhaps all men get like that, I don't know.
1512220	1514020	Perhaps I make a mid-life crisis.
1514060	1516700	I don't like myself as much as I used to, put it that way.
1516780	1520900	I think I need a new adventure, to put that right.
1534940	1537140	Do you want to help us get a sink, just to cover this up?
1537180	1539140	Cos it's going out already.
1539180	1541020	An hour before sunset...
1541060	1543260	The heavens have opened, as expected.
1544580	1545620	We've got a fire going.
1545660	1546540	Yeah, but we've got to put...
1546540	1547380	This is brilliant.
1547420	1549820	However, it is now pissing down with rain.
1549860	1552460	We've got no cover over it whatsoever.
1552500	1555340	We've got nowhere to sleep whatsoever.
1555380	1559820	So I would say our priority is shelter.
1559860	1561780	Honestly, in the politest way possible,
1561820	1565300	we need to cover up this fucking fire cos it's going to go out.
1565340	1569980	Without the fire, the men will have no means of purifying water to drink.
1570020	1573300	Who is doing the leaves? Is anybody getting the leaves to cover this?
1573340	1575420	That is going out in about half an hour.
1575420	1581140	Yeah, clusterfuck. Or foovar. I don't know what the correct military term is.
1581180	1584140	So now we've got a million people trying to do a million things.
1584180	1586100	Hopefully we'll have a million answers.
1586140	1587580	George is fucking mad.
1594940	1597940	This rain is absolutely unbelievable.
1597980	1600700	You don't ever see rain like this in the UK.
1600740	1603300	Absolutely, completely...
1603340	1604300	Stoking.
1604340	1605260	8pm.
1605260	1608580	The men are still desperately trying to make a watertight shelter
1608620	1610380	to save their fire.
1610420	1612380	Over and under. That's it.
1612420	1614820	See if we can bend it, Bart.
1614860	1619100	In this part of the Pacific, storms can last for days
1619140	1622540	and dump inches of rain in an hour.
1622580	1623580	It's a great night.
1623620	1626980	Obviously, we're staying dry under the shelter that we've made.
1627020	1631340	It's a good job we made it, otherwise we'd be absolutely saturated right now.
1631380	1635060	The roof might need possibly a tweak or two.
1635260	1639780	There is a minor bit of snagging before practical completion.
1639820	1644220	It's just something simple like perhaps taking the whole fucking thing down and redoing it.
1648820	1651380	Has anyone checked on Andy?
1651420	1652660	Fuck, we've got one.
1652700	1654100	Andy!
1654140	1655820	Andy!
1655860	1658020	Andy!
1658060	1659700	We've got a headlight, guys.
1659740	1665100	Andy chose to not help the group in any way, shape or form.
1665100	1666620	And went off on his own.
1666660	1667780	Andy's here.
1667820	1669300	Vicky and Andy's here under the tree.
1669340	1672860	I think Andy needs to get a little bit more involved with this all, to be honest.
1678700	1681260	It absolutely pissed down last night.
1681300	1686500	Everyone was awake and everyone was just so wet through.
1686540	1689860	I was sat there and I was just thinking, what am I doing here?
1689900	1691740	I feel kind of pissed.
1691780	1693820	Yeah. It's weird.
1693860	1693980	Yeah.
1694020	1694940	I feel like...
1694940	1696620	I've had a couple of pints.
1696660	1698180	I can't move my legs.
1698220	1700060	I've sat up, I just can't move.
1700100	1701060	Has the bed paralysed you?
1701100	1702140	Yeah. That's great.
1702180	1704460	Completely numb from cocked down.
1706580	1708260	6am.
1708300	1711780	Last night, a violent tropical storm battered the island.
1713900	1717580	After a desperate struggle, the group managed to save their fire
1717620	1720060	with a small temporary shelter.
1720100	1723420	But the men themselves had no protection from the elements.
1724940	1726660	Video diary.
1726700	1728140	I don't know what day it is.
1728180	1730060	I don't know if it's day two, day three.
1730100	1733100	Still no sleep after getting on the island.
1733140	1737340	I think I've had about, honestly, swear to God, an hour's sleep.
1737380	1738580	I can't do it.
1738620	1742900	I've got to think about myself now, you know?
1742940	1744620	Yeah. I've been up all fucking night.
1744660	1746180	I'm a mess because of it.
1746220	1748780	Sleep really is critical to survival
1748820	1751460	because it affects our physical and our mental health.
1751500	1754500	When you get enough of it, it helps your body to recover,
1754500	1757620	to heal, you process thoughts, process memories,
1757660	1760940	but when you don't get enough of it, that's when you become careless,
1760980	1763140	it affects your decision-making abilities
1763180	1765180	and it can even lead to depression.
1767940	1769420	How you doing, fella?
1769460	1770660	Ooh. What's up?
1772300	1774420	I'm struggling a bit, I think.
1776060	1777780	At the moment. With?
1777820	1779700	The mentality of it all.
1779740	1782580	You know what I mean? You've got to get yourself in, like...
1784500	1789020	..in the zone, as it were, and I'm struggling to find the zone, at the moment.
1790460	1792660	I'm really worried about Joe.
1792700	1797700	He's just kind of wandering around, sitting down, head in his hands.
1797740	1800500	I kind of think he's feeling sorry for himself, really,
1800540	1802380	and he's obviously missing home.
1802420	1804100	What's her name? Charlotte.
1804140	1805980	SHE SIGHS
1806020	1808140	Maximum three. You miss her, mate, don't you?
1808180	1809620	So, he made it in two.
1809660	1811860	SHE SIGHS
1811900	1813660	Yeah.
1813700	1814340	Yeah.
1814340	1816100	Best thing that happened to me, though.
1816140	1818060	How long have you been together? Five years.
1818100	1819940	For the first time ever, since I met her,
1819980	1822820	that I've gone 24 hours without speaking to her, so...
1822860	1824980	In fact, you might...
1825020	1826580	Come on, dude, hug it out!
1828740	1830820	You'll be fine, mate, you'll be absolutely fine, honestly.
1830860	1832380	You'll be fine, honestly.
1832420	1834140	HE SIGHS
1838740	1841060	If I don't have a good night's sleep fairly soon,
1841100	1843300	I'm going to end up throttling someone inadvertently.
1843340	1844260	I'm not joking.
1844260	1845580	I'll lose my rag.
1845620	1846900	I don't want a bed to sleep in.
1846940	1848220	I'm not going to get soaking wet.
1848260	1849340	SHE SIGHS
1851460	1854580	The group are relying on their two builders, Andy and Paul,
1854620	1857940	to construct a new watertight shelter.
1857980	1862060	But both have a very different idea about where to put it.
1862100	1864420	We need to pick a location to build this shelter on.
1864460	1865460	Correct.
1865500	1867460	We have two potential locations.
1867500	1869260	Andy, is your place on the beach?
1869300	1870260	Yeah.
1870300	1871780	SHE SIGHS
1871820	1874060	I can put any of these little bits of thicket and brush
1874060	1875300	into it easily.
1875340	1877660	Look, we've got a pit there for a fire pit.
1877700	1880020	This is an absolutely perfect camp.
1880060	1881700	Job's good.
1881740	1883500	This is not Andy's, is it?
1885340	1888140	You're more exposed to the tides, you're more exposed to the weather,
1888180	1891100	and we're going to get bitten to smotherings by sandflies.
1891140	1893060	It's not an option. No way.
1893100	1896460	Andy's camp, it looks like it'll flood at the tidal surge,
1896500	1899860	there's plastic bottles everywhere, I think we'll get bitten to shit.
1899900	1901460	Pointless. Give me my opinion, mate.
1904060	1906820	Fucking nobody listened to fucking me.
1906860	1910020	I would love to have come down here for Andy's sake and gone,
1910060	1911740	this is fucking brilliant, mate.
1911780	1914460	But the trouble is, we walked in here and I kept my mouth shut,
1914500	1917660	but within 30 seconds, everyone went, are you fucking joking?
1917700	1920260	I'm a builder. People get me in to fix anything.
1920300	1923460	Customers phone me up to put their IKEA bedroom stuff together.
1923500	1925460	It's like, well, fuck you then.
1925500	1930300	With Andy's site rejected, Paul shows the men his preferred location.
1930340	1933260	Because it's elevated, this is not really going to be good.
1933260	1935020	It's not really going to get that wet.
1935060	1938900	It's got a fairly good canopy. We can all sleep here on the dry.
1938940	1941420	Correct. You've got a nice little breeze coming through as well.
1941460	1942420	Yeah, I like this place.
1943860	1945380	Now, what do you want me to do, Paul?
1945420	1948380	Well, what we need now are the cross members.
1949980	1952900	I've bitched about Paul being a volcanic rhinoceros,
1952940	1955420	but you know what, he's single-minded,
1955460	1958420	but he makes clear decisions and sticks by them,
1958460	1961900	and he's been right more than he's been wrong so far.
1961940	1962940	Ah!
1963260	1967300	We're fucking saved. We'll be all right now.
1967340	1969300	We knew there was power on the island.
1973260	1974580	How are you finding it?
1974620	1976940	A bit shocked at how... Difficult.
1976980	1978260	..how difficult it's been.
1978300	1979860	We're all here doing the same shit.
1979900	1983100	We're all not sure whether we should see it or not.
1983140	1987100	Determined to boost Joe's morale and keep his mind off home,
1987140	1991700	father of three, Vic, has asked him to join in with the shelter build.
1991740	1993060	It's a challenge.
1993060	1996020	We'll adapt to all this, quicker than any of us will.
1996060	1997060	Far quicker.
1998260	2001540	It's a case of making sure everybody guides everybody else
2001580	2003020	in the right direction.
2003060	2006980	I do firmly believe we will become an excellent team,
2007020	2011180	er, to the point of becoming almost like a tribe.
2015180	2019740	Can we just say, building camp at the top of a steep hill
2019780	2022860	in the middle of rainy season is the stupidest idea
2022860	2023860	we've ever had?
2023900	2024940	Yeah.
2024980	2025980	Ever had.
2026020	2028820	A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
2028860	2030420	And I'm obviously the weakest link.
2030460	2032660	Joe, you're not the weakest link, you're just missing home.
2032700	2033860	It's a natural thing to feel.
2033900	2035980	I think some people do think I'm the weakest link, mate.
2036020	2036980	Do you think that?
2037020	2037980	I don't think so.
2038020	2038980	No, but I think you do.
2039020	2039980	Do you think so? Yeah.
2040020	2041380	Crikey, what's made you think that?
2041420	2044260	Day one when I met you, you've been shouting orders at me from day dot.
2044300	2045260	Have I? No.
2045300	2046900	We're carrying stuff in and out of a jungle
2046940	2048740	and I've got a really heavy rucksack on my back
2048780	2050940	and you're saying, Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do this.
2050980	2051940	Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do that.
2051940	2053180	I don't know if it happens to anyone else,
2053220	2054420	but I think you feel that I'm the youngest,
2054460	2057340	therefore, naturally, you've got some authority over me.
2057380	2060140	And that's been grinding on me a little bit.
2060180	2065180	Joe intimated that I'd been giving him a hard time,
2065220	2068820	which I truly have only tried to be positive with everybody.
2068860	2070180	I was devastated.
2070220	2071500	You're being aggressive. I'm telling you what.
2071540	2074260	You're being passive aggressive and that's not fair.
2074300	2075420	All right?
2075460	2076860	He just told me I'm being passive aggressive
2076900	2078020	while we're having a laugh.
2081940	2083620	I'm being passive aggressive.
2083660	2085460	I'm being passive aggressive.
2085500	2088900	I'm being passive aggressive, you know.
2088940	2093860	However bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity.
2093900	2096660	Survival is about dogged determination,
2096700	2100300	learning from your failures and never giving up.
2100340	2102180	Churchill once said a great quote.
2102220	2105580	He said, if you're going through hell, keep going.
2107300	2110460	My balls are doing the backstroke in a bucket of sand.
2110500	2111820	I'm hungry. I'm tired.
2111940	2115940	All that's going through my head is, I don't self-arm at home,
2115940	2117940	so why the hell am I self-arming out here?
2119940	2121940	6am.
2121940	2126940	I've never been in an environment where last night you hear a thunderstorm
2126940	2130940	and it's now daylight and it's still thundering and it's still raining.
2131940	2135940	Overnight, torrential rain has once again battered the island.
2135940	2140940	The men have managed to protect the fire, but their spirits are low.
2141940	2145940	It is a bit mind-boggling that you can have this much rain in so long.
2145940	2147940	It just keeps coming.
2147940	2151940	Yesterday, the men started work on a new shelter.
2151940	2155940	But only half built, it was no match for the elements.
2158940	2161940	I'm massively underestimated at this place. Massively.
2161940	2165940	I'm so scared of hiking for as long as I can remember.
2165940	2168940	Last night, when I got my first Hunger Rumble,
2168940	2170940	it was playing on my mind a lot more.
2171940	2172940	It's hard.
2176940	2179940	This is apocalyptic weather.
2179940	2182940	It's going to threaten to wash us out of this camp.
2183940	2187940	For the third night in a row, the men have barely slept.
2188940	2190940	The positive? It's daytime.
2190940	2192940	I can see how crap it is.
2195940	2197940	Here in the tropics, when it rains...
2197940	2200940	It's not just nice British drizzle, it's torrential.
2200940	2202940	We can hardly hold a conversation.
2202940	2206940	You've got to spend so much time and energy trying to keep your fire alight
2206940	2209940	when you could be out there fishing or hunting or making shelters.
2209940	2214940	However strong and determined, after a while, it saps you.
2214940	2218940	It saps your spirit in the same way it saps a life out of a fire.
2220940	2223940	I cannot face another day on here. Honestly, I can't.
2224940	2228940	I'm at the stage of almost a breakdown, to be totally honest.
2228940	2229940	You just can't imagine.
2229940	2231940	I can't imagine how tough it is.
2232940	2233940	Unbelievable.
2236940	2239940	The island's youngest member, Joe, says he's had enough.
2242940	2244940	Four weeks, I think, would be a push for me.
2244940	2246940	Six weeks, anything I'd ever make.
2246940	2248940	The pain that I'm going to go through here,
2248940	2251940	leaving the loved ones at home, Charlotte, all the rest of it...
2251940	2253940	Then why did you sign up?
2253940	2254940	I don't know.
2259940	2262940	10am. The storm finally passes.
2264940	2267940	Determined to leave as soon as possible,
2267940	2271940	graphic designer Joe uses the emergency satellite radio
2271940	2273940	to request an evacuation boat.
2275940	2278940	I just really strongly believe that as a person,
2278940	2281940	physically, mentally and all the rest of it,
2281940	2284940	I'm not going to make the rest of the time on the island.
2284940	2287940	And I've not made any rash decisions, cos I'm aware that you can make decisions
2287940	2288940	in the heat of a moment.
2288940	2289940	And I haven't.
2289940	2291940	I just really fancy a margarita pizza.
2293940	2294940	Joe wants to go home.
2296940	2297940	I can't believe it.
2297940	2299940	He's not been here four days.
2299940	2301940	He's not even started and he wants to go home.
2302940	2305940	Joe has agreed to stay on the island for another 24 hours
2305940	2309940	before making a final decision about whether he wants to leave.
2311940	2313940	You hold it up there, mark it and then we'll cut it.
2313940	2314940	Is it long enough?
2315940	2316940	No.
2316940	2317940	You can go halfway there.
2317940	2319940	You can go halfway there.
2319940	2322940	In the jungle, work continues on the shelter.
2322940	2325940	Can you get that any higher?
2325940	2327940	The group have persuaded Andy to help out,
2327940	2331940	hoping the prospect of a dry night will encourage him to stay.
2331940	2332940	One there.
2332940	2333940	Yeah.
2333940	2334940	And then one down here.
2334940	2335940	Right, so not there then?
2335940	2336940	Eh?
2336940	2337940	So not there then?
2337940	2338940	I didn't say to put it there.
2338940	2341940	The whole reason I said I don't want to tie a sled knot in this piece
2341940	2344940	is because we need to get the piece of wood in there first.
2344940	2349940	Paul is a project manager in a construction company
2349940	2352940	and Andy is a builder.
2352940	2354940	Them two personalities just clash
2354940	2357940	because one wants to tell the other one what to do
2357940	2360940	and then this one wants to tell this one what to do.
2360940	2362940	All we need to do is tie this on here, please.
2362940	2363940	That's all we need to do.
2363940	2364940	Where's the bit of wood?
2364940	2367940	Because I'm not tying a fucking knot if there ain't a bit of wood in it.
2367940	2368940	Look, that ain't going nowhere.
2368940	2369940	That's the shape I want.
2369940	2374940	Andy really has a massive problem with me.
2374940	2377940	Everybody's been tip-toeing around me for the past four days.
2377940	2381940	It's just been a fucking prick.
2381940	2383940	But what can you do?
2383940	2386940	Something's just going to explode at some point.
2386940	2389940	Since yesterday, Andy has been hinting
2389940	2393940	that he too might request evacuation from the island.
2393940	2395940	Why are you threatening to go home, Andy?
2395940	2397940	All sorts of reasons, mate.
2397940	2398940	Come on, spit us out.
2398940	2399940	No, I don't need to.
2399940	2400940	Why are you so aggressive?
2400940	2402940	I'm asking you a simple question.
2402940	2403940	Yeah, you've asked me it three times.
2403940	2404940	The first time should have been enough.
2404940	2405940	Then the second time.
2405940	2406940	Now you're asking a fourth time.
2406940	2407940	No, they were different questions.
2407940	2408940	And then you're calling me aggressive
2408940	2411940	because I don't want to answer a question that you've asked four times.
2411940	2412940	I haven't asked it four times.
2412940	2413940	You have.
2413940	2414940	I said, why do you want to go home?
2414940	2415940	You went, because I do.
2415940	2416940	I went, well, give us a reason.
2416940	2417940	You went, I'm not going to give you a reason.
2417940	2418940	Exactly.
2418940	2419940	So then you asked again.
2419940	2420940	There must be a reason.
2420940	2421940	And then you asked again.
2421940	2422940	I didn't ask again, Andy.
2422940	2423940	You did.
2423940	2424940	What is the fucking matter with you?
2424940	2426940	Nothing the matter with me, son.
2426940	2429940	At all.
2429940	2431940	Do we wedge that there and then prop it up?
2431940	2433940	Whatever Andy wants to do.
2433940	2434940	I've had enough.
2434940	2435940	Hang on.
2435940	2440940	We need your expertise.
2440940	2442940	I said, stop asking me.
2442940	2445940	And he carried on asking me.
2445940	2450940	Fucking unbelievable.
2450940	2453940	With the camp's two builders walking off the job,
2453940	2456940	construction of the shelter grinds to a halt.
2456940	2462940	There's no doubt there's a lot of strong, pretty macho personalities on the men's island.
2462940	2465940	And yeah, they're all trying to find their place in that pecking order.
2465940	2470940	But the danger when you get these high pressure situations like this is that the alpha males
2470940	2473940	start to compete instead of cooperate.
2473940	2476940	And then the danger is it blows a whole group apart.
2476940	2477940	I'm used to being in control.
2477940	2480940	I'm used to being organized, everything running efficiently.
2480940	2482940	It's what I do.
2482940	2485940	That ignorant twat wants to do it his way.
2485940	2486940	Yeah.
2486940	2487940	I have no fucking clue.
2487940	2488940	It makes your head.
2488940	2490940	It's like it wants to implode.
2490940	2492940	Seriously, my world is a punch to the throat.
2492940	2493940	He's down.
2493940	2494940	Gone.
2494940	2495940	Finished.
2495940	2496940	It's over with.
2496940	2497940	I walk away.
2497940	2498940	Happy days.
2498940	2499940	I can't do that here.
2499940	2500940	Bang.
2500940	2501940	Done.
2501940	2502940	Fat cunt.
2502940	2503940	You know what I mean?
2503940	2510940	There's a lot of bad blood in camp at the minute, largely between Paul and Andy.
2510940	2515940	We've got enough on our plate in this island without alpha male dick swinging.
2515940	2519940	I think everyone just needs to man the fuck up, really.
2519940	2526940	I just feel like everything I do, mate, he's just there, ready to fucking knock it down,
2526940	2527940	you know, or criticize.
2527940	2529940	It's like, fuck off, you know?
2529940	2531940	If he goes, I'll stay.
2531940	2533940	People might make problems.
2533940	2543940	So I overheard a conversation with Andy.
2543940	2544940	His exact words were,
2544940	2548940	if Paul leaves, that would be good because then I will stay.
2548940	2550940	I'm not dealing with that sort of immaturity.
2550940	2552940	He's supposed to be a grown man.
2552940	2553940	I'm not being blackmailed.
2553940	2556940	I don't need to be surrounded by this immaturity.
2556940	2558940	I might just have to go.
2558940	2560940	Are you thinking about fucking off?
2560940	2562940	Can't be fucking bothered.
2562940	2563940	Mate, you can't go, mate.
2563940	2564940	You literally can't go.
2564940	2567940	Do you think that you would regret it later on?
2567940	2568940	You will regret it.
2568940	2569940	I think I won't.
2569940	2570940	Just suck it up, mate.
2570940	2571940	Lift up your skirt.
2571940	2573940	Wash the sand out of your vagina, mate.
2575940	2577940	In a disastrous turn of events,
2577940	2580940	three men, including the island's two builders,
2580940	2582940	are now threatening to walk.
2583940	2589940	Andy, Paul and Joe all want to leave this island.
2589940	2592940	I'm amazed that they've come this far
2592940	2594940	and want to give up so early.
2601940	2603940	As yet another storm hits the island,
2603940	2605940	the men call a crisis meeting.
2606940	2608940	I know it sounds cutthroat,
2608940	2611940	but we need to keep as many of those guys here as we can.
2611940	2613940	But for any of them to change their mind is a win.
2615940	2618940	There's been so much discussion about people leaving.
2618940	2622940	My personal opinion is that we are stronger together
2622940	2623940	than we are apart.
2623940	2624940	Agreed.
2624940	2626940	Joe, my hope is that you might have thought differently...
2626940	2627940	We've already done this.
2627940	2628940	I've already had the chat with everyone.
2628940	2629940	People have already said their thoughts.
2629940	2631940	I've already said my thoughts, but...
2631940	2632940	On that note,
2632940	2633940	I will be saying no more.
2633940	2636940	I'll just be waiting for the boat to arrive and to leave, OK?
2638940	2640940	Paul, would you just let us know
2640940	2642940	how you're feeling at the moment?
2642940	2644940	I came to this island as a bit of a release,
2644940	2647940	you know, to get away from my everyday life.
2648940	2650940	I'm not really confrontational.
2650940	2652940	I don't like having arguments with people.
2652940	2655940	I'd rather just step away from the situation.
2655940	2658940	The final nail in the coffin was to hear somebody say
2658940	2661940	that it was good that I was going,
2661940	2663940	which I thought was a bit of a shame,
2663940	2667940	but in another way, it confirmed my decision.
2667940	2670940	And in that case, that's why I decided to go.
2670940	2672940	If one goes, there's no point in the other going.
2672940	2673940	Right, here we go.
2673940	2674940	How we make that decision...
2674940	2675940	Here we go.
2675940	2677940	This is now we're getting to the country.
2677940	2680940	He's segregated himself from the group from day one.
2680940	2682940	We're having a discussion, he doesn't want to know.
2682940	2684940	We haven't got any beds, he makes himself a bed.
2684940	2686940	He goes off in socks.
2686940	2687940	Somehow, that's my fault.
2687940	2689940	I've had no sleep the whole day.
2689940	2690940	Neither has anybody.
2690940	2692940	You've been sleeping.
2692940	2694940	Sorry, mate, you've been sleeping.
2694940	2696940	Andy, nobody's had any sleep.
2696940	2698940	As a group, no-one here has had enough sleep
2698940	2701940	to give them the energy to do what they're about to do the next day.
2701940	2703940	So you pointing a finger at me and saying,
2703940	2706940	well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.
2706940	2708940	I've been having a laugh up until I heard
2708940	2711940	one of my team-mates say they wanted me to go.
2711940	2713940	I was having a right crack.
2713940	2714940	Now I'm not.
2714940	2717940	In a community, not everyone gets on,
2717940	2719940	and that is a fact of life.
2719940	2721940	We can't change that.
2721940	2723940	So let's build our community.
2723940	2726940	You and you, just keep your distance.
2726940	2727940	At least we're together.
2727940	2729940	We're two men up.
2729940	2730940	We can build a shelter in a day
2730940	2732940	rather than taking two days with two men down.
2732940	2734940	The big strong man and the builder.
2734940	2737940	If you two fuck off, then we're fucked, aren't we?
2737940	2739940	See, I don't want to lose two builders,
2739940	2741940	regardless of your characters.
2741940	2743940	We need you to stay.
2743940	2746940	I'm going to walk away, and then that would hopefully...
2746940	2747940	No, listen.
2747940	2749940	So Andy can engage.
2749940	2752940	Enjoy his experience, and hopefully five.
2752940	2754940	Then you're not losing two people, are you?
2754940	2755940	You're losing one.
2755940	2757940	I'm leaving the island.
2757940	2758940	Whether Paul leaves or not.
2758940	2759940	Whether Paul leaves or not.
2759940	2762940	I would rather Paul stay.
2762940	2764940	He's a stronger man than me.
2764940	2766940	He'll be more benefit to you.
2766940	2769940	But either way, I'm sorry, I'm going.
2769940	2772940	For him to fucking say, I'm glad he's going, good,
2772940	2774940	then I'll stay, then all of a sudden
2774940	2776940	he hasn't got his own way again,
2776940	2778940	and it's, oh, I'm going, there's other reasons.
2778940	2780940	It's fucking immaturity.
2780940	2782940	It's sulking, and it's attention-seeking.
2782940	2784940	And you don't want to be scapegoated, I realise this.
2784940	2786940	Pollocks, absolute pollocks. I'm not having it.
2786940	2788940	I am going off this island,
2788940	2791940	because I'm not being held responsible for that.
2791940	2792940	End of story.
2795940	2797940	Next time on The Women's Island...
2797940	2799940	Oh, my God!
2799940	2801940	A huge fucking snake came towards me!
2801940	2804940	Fucking hell!
2804940	2806940	At the minute, we are barely coping
2806940	2808940	with the situation in which we find ourselves.
2808940	2810940	Oh, shit, no, wait, sit forward.
2810940	2812940	We have nothing to drink.
2812940	2814940	We don't know where we are.
2814940	2816940	Hello!
