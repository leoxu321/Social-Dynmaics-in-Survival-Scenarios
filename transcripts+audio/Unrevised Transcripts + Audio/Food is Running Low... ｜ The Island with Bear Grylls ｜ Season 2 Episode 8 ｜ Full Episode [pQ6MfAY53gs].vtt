00:00.000 --> 00:14.560
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

00:14.560 --> 00:22.960
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be

00:22.960 --> 00:33.700
utterly alone with only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything

00:33.700 --> 00:39.460
themselves when pushed to the limits of human endurance hello you can see Pierce's heart beating

00:39.460 --> 00:51.580
through the rib will it be brute power or mental strength the Windsor day who will have what it

00:51.580 --> 00:52.900
takes to stay alive

00:52.960 --> 01:05.080
tonight we follow the women's island survival will be harder than ever they'll have to find

01:05.080 --> 01:10.720
water and hunt for their own food that is the biggest shocker I've ever seen living on the

01:10.720 --> 01:20.820
island in the middle of tropical storm season we expected to survive it when pitted against

01:20.820 --> 01:21.580
the extremes of nature

01:22.960 --> 01:31.000
and these Monday women got what it takes to survive guys come back here really slowly

01:31.000 --> 01:50.800
it's been almost three weeks since I dropped 14 women off on this remote Pacific Island radio in

01:50.800 --> 01:52.800
now medic now

01:52.960 --> 01:58.280
they're three people down I thought she'd hang on in there and with fewer women to hunt and food running

01:58.280 --> 02:04.720
dangerously low surely I'm gonna die soon spa owner Abby one of the oldest of the women has kept the

02:04.720 --> 02:15.400
group together she encouraged the others to make a difficult but necessary survival choice to eat

02:15.400 --> 02:19.500
their pet pigs I don't know about anyone else but I feel like a wild animal

02:22.960 --> 02:41.960
what's your assessment of the situation hairdresser there's a vocabulary for hairdressers so as not to offend the client so I'm always subtle in my work so I'd say it's f***ing had it

02:41.960 --> 02:47.820
after weeks on the island stripped of all luxuries Abby is improvising in her island salon with a novel blue rinse it's probably permanent boat paint or something

02:47.820 --> 02:51.960
it's probably permanent boat paint or something

02:52.960 --> 02:59.960
basins are over there the junior will see to it

02:59.960 --> 03:02.960
quite happy now I've done a bit of hairdressing

03:02.960 --> 03:09.960
oh look at the colour of the sea that's what we want to swim in

03:09.960 --> 03:19.960
in a group like this when you're really starving and struggling all you need is that one person to kind of shine a little beacon of light and say something really witty and funny

03:19.960 --> 03:22.960
and Abby is that person

03:22.960 --> 03:24.960
it's 95 pound please

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
the oven's broken

03:33.960 --> 03:35.960
thanks chef

03:35.960 --> 03:37.960
oh my god

03:37.960 --> 03:42.960
it's been days since women ate the piglets and they haven't had a decent meal since

03:42.960 --> 03:47.960
can I have it with sand please I don't think I've got enough sand in my mouth

03:47.960 --> 03:50.960
they're back to eating scraps of foraged coconut and yucca

03:50.960 --> 03:51.960
and starvation isn't fair

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
and their wife is far away

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
did you notice it was on fire

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
oh wow

03:56.960 --> 04:06.960
you're getting a really burnt one

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
with some eating as little as a dangerously low 200 calories a day

04:07.960 --> 04:10.960
any stores they started off with are basically gone

04:10.960 --> 04:17.960
so the women need to go all out to increase their food intake and their lives are going to depend on that

04:17.960 --> 04:19.960
I'm psyched like you did

04:19.960 --> 04:20.960
spit that out

04:20.960 --> 04:21.960
it's too burnt

04:21.960 --> 04:26.760
that's disgusting i was saying a couple of days ago in jest that i feel like my body's

04:26.760 --> 04:37.000
digesting itself but i just know more i am eating myself from the inside i'm just hoping that we can

04:37.640 --> 04:44.680
get some food do you know what my favorite thing to do at the minute is i go to the imaginary

04:44.680 --> 04:49.560
supermarket in my head with a shopping trolley empty and go up and down the aisles and do

04:49.560 --> 04:55.640
shopping i spent about 10 minutes in the jam and condiments section yesterday did you what did you

04:55.640 --> 05:00.840
get well i mean i went to the i bought marmalade i got shredded and smooth in the edge because i

05:00.840 --> 05:04.520
didn't know what to do and i was going along because i'd obviously bought the imaginary pate

05:04.520 --> 05:07.960
so that i needed to debate which imaginary condiment would go best and then i got to

05:07.960 --> 05:12.520
the bakery and i didn't know whether i wanted crusty bread or soft bread this is the mind of

05:12.520 --> 05:19.240
a lunatic in terms of survival skills i think i'm quite mentally strong

05:19.240 --> 05:19.480
and i'm not a person who's just going to go around doing a lot of stuff but i'm not a person who's

05:19.480 --> 05:19.520
going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to

05:19.520 --> 05:19.540
i'm not going to go around doing a lot of stuff and i'm not going to do a lot of stuff and i'm not going to

05:19.540 --> 05:21.620
I don't think there's much that will rattle me,

05:21.620 --> 05:24.780
but then I've never really been pushed to my limits before.

05:24.780 --> 05:27.500
The biggest challenge is being able to go for a long period

05:27.500 --> 05:29.460
without a good dinner in my belly.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.900
I don't think myself as a natural hunter-gatherer,

05:31.900 --> 05:35.300
but in 34 years, nothing's got between me and Emil yet.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.660
So if there's food on that island, I'll find it.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.540
Unable to digest yucca,

05:45.540 --> 05:48.900
the women's breakfast is not agreeing with Georgina.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.580
I've been sick again. I can't stop.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.900
Oh, my God!

05:51.900 --> 05:54.500
I don't know what I'm... There's nothing to suck up, though.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.300
Are you drinking enough?

05:57.300 --> 05:59.900
Yeah, I've just tried to drink a little more.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.460
I'm driving you mad.

06:01.460 --> 06:05.980
Camp doctor Belinda is concerned about Georgina's condition.

06:05.980 --> 06:10.340
George literally exists on a couple of limpets a day

06:10.340 --> 06:12.180
and maybe a couple of snails.

06:12.180 --> 06:17.020
She does not eat more than about that much tiny square of coconut a day,

06:17.020 --> 06:18.620
so she's probably consuming

06:18.620 --> 06:21.700
under 20 calories per day.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.940
And it's just not sustainable.

06:23.940 --> 06:27.260
Georgina's inability to digest their limited diet

06:27.260 --> 06:30.340
means she could be putting her vital organs at risk.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.980
You had some recting, yeah?

06:32.980 --> 06:37.220
Yeah, well, this is one of the major reasons

06:37.220 --> 06:40.420
why I'm worried about your kidneys.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.340
So we'll just get your temperature.

06:45.060 --> 06:48.420
I mean, I can literally feel my muscles within my body.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.740
They're really wasting away.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.100
Er, and I just heard that was messed up at one of them.

06:56.620 --> 07:00.180
I just need to get some food. Just something.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.980
Because if I don't, then it could be endgame for me, really,

07:02.980 --> 07:04.740
with regards to being on the island.

07:11.220 --> 07:12.420
Off we go.

07:14.540 --> 07:18.420
Everyone is now pitching in to try and find protein that they can share

07:18.420 --> 07:20.100
with Georgina.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.020
A group led by Abi are scouring the shoreline.

07:26.540 --> 07:29.180
They're very hard to get off.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.100
Look at the size of that monster.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.540
Can I have a try? You can.

07:32.540 --> 07:35.180
Just have a try at just banging it.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.540
Do you say that to your boyfriend?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.860
Yeah!

07:38.860 --> 07:39.860
Limp it.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.300
So you've got the cool, the warms and the natural,

07:45.300 --> 07:47.700
so that's got to slight.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.260
It's got a lilac-y tinge in it, but it's nice.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.780
I run my own business.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.460
Sales for last month is really, really good.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.780
I like being in charge of people and a team.

07:57.780 --> 08:00.860
I'll work at something till I am successful at it.

08:00.860 --> 08:01.860
I have a bad back.

08:01.860 --> 08:04.740
It causes me quite a lot of problems and quite a lot of pain.

08:04.740 --> 08:07.420
I get through it and I don't let it stop me doing anything at the moor.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.500
I'll snow ski, I'll ride, I'll push myself.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Good lad.

08:15.380 --> 08:15.820
First day we came up... Yeah. ..they were like,

08:15.820 --> 08:16.820
Yeah.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.180
..on that back wall.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.860
There's just no bloody limpets.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.140
It's like we've eaten them all.

08:23.140 --> 08:24.180
It's warm down there.

08:24.180 --> 08:25.660
Yeah, well, I'm not going down there to get down there.

08:25.660 --> 08:26.660
It's not where you've been for a while.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.180
I'm not risking my life to get a frigging limpet.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.340
No chance.

08:30.860 --> 08:32.940
With limpets few and far between,

08:32.940 --> 08:36.980
the women desperately need to find a protein-rich meal for Georgina.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.020
Get the knife! Get the knife!

08:40.020 --> 08:42.020
What is that? Get the machete!

08:42.980 --> 08:44.020
Where's the machete?

08:44.820 --> 08:46.020
Just get the fucking machete.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.820
Georgia spotted a stingray in the shallows.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.820
Wow! It's fast!

08:56.820 --> 08:58.820
Oh, no chance.

09:00.820 --> 09:02.820
How fast did that move?

09:02.820 --> 09:04.820
That was like lightning fast.

09:06.820 --> 09:07.820
Where did the bottles go?

09:07.820 --> 09:11.820
The miss has cost them a potential 4,000-calorie meal.

09:11.820 --> 09:15.820
We would have had a proper belly food, you know, proper belly food.

09:15.820 --> 09:19.820
As opposed to this much dried coconut every day.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.820
Georgina must once again go to bed hungry.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.820
But she's not the only one who's suffering.

09:37.820 --> 09:42.820
I've got pants as my pillow and smelly socks.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.820
47-year-old Abi has been diagnosed

09:45.820 --> 09:48.820
with back pain since a horse-riding accident in her teens.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.820
Oh, God.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.820
Abi's not happy. She's in pain.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.820
So, I hope she's OK.

10:01.820 --> 10:05.820
Since arriving on the island, she's been sleeping on the hard ground.

10:05.820 --> 10:08.820
I have nowhere comfortable I can go.

10:08.820 --> 10:11.820
Honestly, it's laying down on the floor.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.820
I think my back's absolutely screwed.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.820
It's really hard to explain,

10:17.820 --> 10:19.820
because it's not something you can see.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.820
And it is my health,

10:21.820 --> 10:24.820
and it's not something that anyone can help me with.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.820
I don't want to be a liability to anyone else

10:26.820 --> 10:29.820
and not be able to do the things that I came to do,

10:29.820 --> 10:31.820
which was to help and be a grafter.

10:41.820 --> 10:43.820
So, I've got the scales here.

10:43.820 --> 10:47.820
I've calibrated them and set the dial to zero.

10:47.820 --> 10:52.820
But it's all the women's health that's a concern for Dr Belinda.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.820
After noticing the steep decline in Georgina's physical condition,

10:56.820 --> 10:59.820
she wants to closely monitor the group's weight loss.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.820
Abi!

11:01.820 --> 11:04.820
I used to go to Slimming Club, right, every Monday.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.820
I feel like I'm back there.

11:06.820 --> 11:11.820
If I am ten and a half stone today, I'll be a happy bunny.

11:11.820 --> 11:16.820
£135.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.820
Got my goal.

11:18.820 --> 11:22.820
In 21st-century Britain, we're all obsessed with body image.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.820
But when the pounds are dropping off

11:24.820 --> 11:26.820
because of starvation and malnutrition,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.820
it's a dangerous mindset to have,

11:28.820 --> 11:32.820
and it really is not a cause for celebration.

11:32.820 --> 11:35.820
But you can see your waist is tiny-ton round.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.820
Let me see your tiny little waist.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.820
Aw, look at that little waist.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.820
SHE LAUGHS

11:46.820 --> 11:48.820
George.

11:48.820 --> 11:49.820
You've lost a lot.

11:49.820 --> 11:51.820
You're wasting away, aren't you, sweetheart?

11:51.820 --> 11:54.820
I have to say, I don't find starvation a good way of losing weight.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.820
I don't think we should be celebrating.

11:56.820 --> 11:59.820
I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.820
Georgina has lost a dangerous £21 in weight,

12:05.820 --> 12:08.820
and collectively, the group have lost almost ten stone,

12:08.820 --> 12:10.820
the weight of an entire person.

12:12.820 --> 12:16.820
We're at a critical stage where our bodies have got no food...

12:18.820 --> 12:21.820
..and so can't sustain themselves.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.820
We're not on a diet.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.820
We're starving.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.820
Concerned about their dramatic weight loss,

12:31.820 --> 12:34.820
Georgina calls a group together.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.820
I do feel like I may have nosedived

12:37.820 --> 12:40.820
in terms of food deprivation a lot quicker than the rest of you.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.820
I can see that I've been a lot weaker than the rest of you.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.820
And I really do think that food still needs to be number one priority.

12:46.820 --> 12:49.820
I just don't know how long we can sustain five limpets.

12:49.820 --> 12:50.820
I don't think we can.

12:50.820 --> 12:52.820
I think we're all a little bit in denial

12:52.820 --> 12:55.820
about how critical it is that we start finding food.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.820
The need to find protein for Georgina is now urgent.

13:05.820 --> 13:07.820
With only a few hours of daylight left,

13:07.820 --> 13:09.820
a group led by Lauren are setting traps.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.820
And the hope is snaring a pig.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.820
Nice little track, isn't it?

13:16.820 --> 13:20.820
Unless you're wanting to survive off shredded old pits of coconut

13:20.820 --> 13:22.820
and the old yucca plant,

13:22.820 --> 13:24.820
then it's time to face up to the fact

13:24.820 --> 13:29.820
that I'm going to have to maybe, you know, get a bit brutal.

13:29.820 --> 13:30.820
Are you ready?

13:30.820 --> 13:31.820
Yeah, it works.

13:31.820 --> 13:32.820
Yeah.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.820
Rise and shine, beautiful.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.820
It's a glorious day.

13:44.820 --> 13:46.820
7am.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.820
And the women have endured another bad night's sleep.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.820
Oh, bloody hell.

13:58.820 --> 14:03.820
In pain, 47-year-old Abi confides in her closest friend, Beth.

14:03.820 --> 14:06.820
Every night when I said, this is the time I dread,

14:06.820 --> 14:08.820
I'm so uncomfortable.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.820
Even just turning from my back to my right

14:11.820 --> 14:13.820
is like a knife going into the nerve.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.820
It's like, argh!

14:15.820 --> 14:17.820
I'm now really concerned.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.820
She hasn't really moaned.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.820
One of Abi's problems is that she's worried

14:25.820 --> 14:27.820
that she doesn't like giving up.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.820
She likes to keep going and keep going.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.820
She's such a hard worker.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.820
She's just fucking amazing.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.820
Let's see what's in this sucker.

14:38.820 --> 14:41.820
She's a proper, proper grafter.

14:41.820 --> 14:43.820
And I love that.

14:43.820 --> 14:46.820
But her mind is saying one thing and her body's saying something else

14:46.820 --> 14:48.820
and she's got to listen to her body.

14:51.820 --> 14:54.820
At camp, Abi calls an urgent meeting.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.820
Over the last few days, my back's gone downhill massively

14:59.820 --> 15:02.820
to the point where I'm in a lot of pain

15:02.820 --> 15:05.820
and it's now worse than it's ever been.

15:05.820 --> 15:07.820
I know certain people here,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.820
kind of said, do less.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.820
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be happy doing less.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.820
But the fact is, I have to get off the island

15:16.820 --> 15:19.820
because I'm not helpful to you anymore.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.820
I'm really sorry and I feel like a shit.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.820
I can't... I actually can't believe it.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.820
I'm just completely shocked.

15:30.820 --> 15:33.820
I knew that she was in pain, I knew that she was having back pain,

15:33.820 --> 15:36.820
but it's just happened so fast.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.820
I'm really gutted to see you go

15:38.820 --> 15:41.820
because I think we could have done really well here with you

15:41.820 --> 15:44.820
and I think we'd be a little bit weaker without you.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.820
I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me now

15:47.820 --> 15:51.820
that is completely terrified because there is only ten of us.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.820
Because everything now is going to be completely harder.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.820
And I can't imagine how we're going to get through

15:56.820 --> 15:58.820
and we're going to feed ourselves.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.820
I think hunger's going to become such a problem.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.820
And me pussy mate.

16:06.820 --> 16:08.820
I don't know what I'm going to do.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.820
So sad.

16:12.820 --> 16:16.820
I'm annoyed for her that she had to go because of her back.

16:16.820 --> 16:22.820
And I'm annoyed for me that I'm going to have to stay out here.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.820
But we just got on really well

16:26.820 --> 16:28.820
and it was just really nice to know that she was there.

16:31.820 --> 16:32.820
Bye.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.820
I miss you already, come back!

16:37.820 --> 16:40.820
I don't know about you, but I feel thoroughly fed up.

16:41.820 --> 16:42.820
Yeah.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.820
I feel as a group, get smaller and smaller,

16:44.820 --> 16:46.820
you're like, how are we meant to do this?

16:46.820 --> 16:47.820
Exactly.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.820
How on earth are we meant to do this?

16:49.820 --> 16:50.820
Exactly.

16:52.820 --> 16:53.820
Yeah, it's shit.

16:54.820 --> 16:55.820
It's really shit.

16:58.820 --> 17:01.820
The group has lost Abi, one of their most valued members.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.820
Now they'll each have to work

17:05.820 --> 17:09.820
even harder to find food for 34-year-old Georgina,

17:09.820 --> 17:11.820
who is dangerously weak from starvation.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.820
How do I have the patience for that, Lauren?

17:16.820 --> 17:18.820
Neither do I, really, but...

17:19.820 --> 17:21.820
I really want to eat something.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.820
The women haven't caught a single fish

17:24.820 --> 17:27.820
since they first stepped foot on the island.

17:27.820 --> 17:30.820
They're attempting to set nets for the first time.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.820
I'm literally solely focused on getting through the days

17:33.820 --> 17:34.820
and getting food.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.820
And I'm going to go after it, and I'm going to get it.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.820
And I'm going to get it for the other girls as well, you know?

17:40.820 --> 17:42.820
I feel sorry for George,

17:42.820 --> 17:45.820
because he's just been absolutely nailed by illness,

17:45.820 --> 17:48.820
and so failure is not an option.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.820
Whoa!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.820
That's not even stable at all.

17:54.820 --> 17:55.820
Hello!

17:56.820 --> 17:59.820
On a desert island, one of your best sources of food

17:59.820 --> 18:01.820
is obviously going to come from the sea,

18:01.820 --> 18:03.820
but none of the women are able to do that.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.820
None of the women are experienced at sea fishing,

18:05.820 --> 18:08.820
so the reality is it's going to take them hours and hours

18:08.820 --> 18:10.820
of painstaking trial and error,

18:10.820 --> 18:13.820
being patient if they're going to hone their skills.

18:13.820 --> 18:17.820
It's as sturdy as we're going to get it.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.820
Who knows? Could be fish tonight.

18:26.820 --> 18:30.820
It's now 12 hours since Lauren and the group set the nets.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.820
I'm hoping that we've got about ten fish in our net.

18:33.820 --> 18:36.820
Come on, net. Do us good. Do us good.

18:36.820 --> 18:39.820
Their last hope of feeding Georgina tonight

18:39.820 --> 18:41.820
rests on a decent haul.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.820
There's one of our floats.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.820
Is the net here? Is it?

18:50.820 --> 18:52.820
Is there a fish in it? No.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.820
Ah! Bastard.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.820
That's such a shame.

19:00.820 --> 19:03.820
I don't know if we'll ever be able to untangle that net.

19:03.820 --> 19:05.820
No, we're not.

19:06.820 --> 19:08.820
How the fuck are we going to catch fish?

19:17.820 --> 19:20.820
I feel pathetic today. No.

19:20.820 --> 19:24.820
Honestly, I haven't been able to function at all today.

19:24.820 --> 19:27.820
With no fish and Georgina's health hanging in the balance,

19:27.820 --> 19:30.820
it's a race against time to find food.

19:30.820 --> 19:33.820
To make sure these women have a fighting chance of survival,

19:33.820 --> 19:36.820
I've made sure that the island's got enough water,

19:36.820 --> 19:39.820
indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive,

19:39.820 --> 19:44.820
but only if they've got the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill it.

19:46.820 --> 19:48.820
Fingers crossed.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.820
Yesterday, Lauren and Beth set animal traps

19:51.820 --> 19:53.820
in the island's jungle interior.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.820
They're going back to see if they've been successful.

19:57.820 --> 20:01.820
Something has eaten the bait but not set off the trap.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.820
Got the knife.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.820
It's not a game and it's a long time without food

20:08.820 --> 20:10.820
and we can't survive without food.

20:10.820 --> 20:13.820
I think it's about time that, you know,

20:13.820 --> 20:16.820
we get out there and start hunting some animals.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.820
One of my main things that's pushing me for this challenge

20:20.820 --> 20:22.820
is finding out who I am.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.820
Can I survive? Can I hunt for my own food?

20:25.820 --> 20:27.820
We don't do that nowadays.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.820
Super cheesy lasagne.

20:29.820 --> 20:30.820
Cheesy dip.

20:30.820 --> 20:32.820
Johnson cheesy dip.

20:33.820 --> 20:36.820
Just think it's getting back to our animalistic roots

20:36.820 --> 20:39.820
and what happens if you have to go hunting for it,

20:39.820 --> 20:43.820
kill it yourself, skin it or whatever, and then cook it.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.820
It's been set off.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.820
It has.

20:51.820 --> 20:53.820
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.820
They've caught a pig by its leg in one of their traps.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.820
Fuck!

21:04.820 --> 21:06.820
That is one huge pig.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.820
I can't believe that.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.820
Before killing it, Lauren and Beth decide to return to camp

21:11.820 --> 21:13.820
to plan and prepare their tools.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.820
Oh, my God, we're going to eat tonight. I know.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.820
Like we've never eaten before.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.820
Yay!

21:20.820 --> 21:22.820
Georgie, we've caught one.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.820
We've caught a pig.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.820
You are kidding me. No.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.820
Because there's a pig in the trap.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.820
We literally walked in and heard this noise.

21:30.820 --> 21:31.820
It's right there. Yeah.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.820
Oh, my God.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.820
Oh, my God.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.820
Oh, my God.

21:39.820 --> 21:40.820
Everybody needs that food,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.820
but I recognise that I really need that food.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.820
It's a little bit of a mental feeling.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.820
And who knew that a pig in a snare would...

21:50.820 --> 21:52.820
..would feel like such an emotional thing?

21:55.820 --> 21:59.820
We're just going to have to absolutely throw our bodies at it.

21:59.820 --> 22:00.820
Don't look at it in the eye.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.820
Don't have your eyes wide and looking at it,

22:02.820 --> 22:04.820
so don't show any of your teeth.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.820
Approach it really quietly. OK.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.820
And so, once we've got it on the ground,

22:08.820 --> 22:10.820
you need to tie its hooves together

22:10.820 --> 22:12.820
and we're also letting loose its neck,

22:12.820 --> 22:14.820
so someone will have to be pulling on its neck.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.820
Does anyone else want to kill the pig?

22:17.820 --> 22:19.820
I don't feel confident that I could.

22:19.820 --> 22:20.820
I don't know enough.

22:20.820 --> 22:24.820
If you need help at any stage, I'm more than happy to help.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.820
Yeah. OK.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.820
At the minute, I'm the only one in the house

22:28.820 --> 22:30.820
at the minute, I'm the only one in the group

22:30.820 --> 22:32.820
that could actually physically kill an animal

22:32.820 --> 22:34.820
because no-one else wants to do it.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.820
And so I feel that's a responsibility as well.

22:37.820 --> 22:40.820
I don't see them as an animal any more,

22:40.820 --> 22:43.820
which is so strange for me.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.820
I love animals to pieces,

22:44.820 --> 22:47.820
but I just feel completely detached from that now.

22:51.820 --> 22:52.820
It's been over an hour

22:52.820 --> 22:55.820
since Lauren and Beth found the pig in the trap.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.820
A decisive kill is in store.

22:58.820 --> 23:01.820
It is now crucial to the whole group.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.820
I'm going to go for the head.

23:03.820 --> 23:04.820
Then I'm going to go for the legs.

23:04.820 --> 23:05.820
I'm ready to go.

23:05.820 --> 23:06.820
So come in with your hooves,

23:06.820 --> 23:08.820
and I'm going to go with the side of the leg.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.820
So you've got it.

23:10.820 --> 23:11.820
Get in.

23:21.820 --> 23:23.820
Someone grab this.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.820
Come round this side.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.820
Beth, come round this side.

23:26.820 --> 23:27.820
The trap.

23:29.820 --> 23:30.820
OK, right.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.820
Make some moves.

23:33.820 --> 23:34.820
Hang on.

23:34.820 --> 23:35.820
Right.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.820
OK, Beth.

23:36.820 --> 23:37.820
Step.

23:37.820 --> 23:38.820
Beth.

23:44.820 --> 23:45.820
Try and...

23:50.820 --> 23:51.820
Fuck.

23:55.820 --> 23:56.820
Fuck's sake.

23:58.820 --> 24:02.820
That's...

24:02.820 --> 24:04.820
That's so frustrating.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.820
We lived and learned on that one.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.820
I think that you need to get on him quicker.

24:09.820 --> 24:11.820
I feel like I fucked that one up.

24:11.820 --> 24:12.820
Damn it.

24:12.820 --> 24:13.820
Damn it.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.820
Could have bloody...

24:14.820 --> 24:16.820
And now I feel like we've let down everybody else.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.820
You know, the ones waiting at camp, thinking,

24:18.820 --> 24:20.820
oh, they've got a pig and they're eating tonight.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.820
And George isn't very well.

24:22.820 --> 24:23.820
She's being sick.

24:23.820 --> 24:24.820
So...

24:26.820 --> 24:27.820
Yeah.

24:27.820 --> 24:28.820
Nice.

24:28.820 --> 24:29.820
Good.

24:29.820 --> 24:30.820
Good.

24:30.820 --> 24:31.820
All right.

24:31.820 --> 24:32.820
How much we got?

24:32.820 --> 24:33.820
Not enough.

24:33.820 --> 24:34.820
Could do with a bit more of everything.

24:34.820 --> 24:35.820
Maybe around the next bit.

24:35.820 --> 24:36.820
But I think we've exhausted this little section.

24:36.820 --> 24:47.820
With the hunter failure, Georgina has no choice but to join Georgie and Becky on another

24:47.820 --> 24:48.820
bleak search for shellfish.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.820
It's so hot, isn't it?

24:49.820 --> 24:50.820
Yeah.

24:50.820 --> 24:51.820
It's really humid.

24:51.820 --> 24:52.820
Really hot.

24:52.820 --> 24:53.820
Already weak from malnutrition, the effort is further depleting Georgina's dainties.

24:53.820 --> 24:54.820
Yeah.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.820
We've got a little bit of everything.

24:55.820 --> 24:56.820
There's some more.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.820
creating Georgina's dangerously low reserves.

25:01.820 --> 25:05.820
The function of my being is struggling.

25:07.820 --> 25:11.820
I feel like the switch has been turned off every time I stand up.

25:15.820 --> 25:17.820
I don't know what to do about it, either.

25:17.820 --> 25:21.820
It's like a vicious circle. You need the energy to get the food.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.820
But you haven't got the energy without the food.

25:27.820 --> 25:30.820
I honestly don't know where these girls are getting their energy from.

25:31.820 --> 25:33.820
Swim time! It certainly is.

25:34.820 --> 25:36.820
Let's go for a swim, babe. Yeah.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.820
I'm just really worried about how weak I am.

25:39.820 --> 25:42.820
I just don't want to be the person who's, like, a dead weight.

25:42.820 --> 25:45.820
You're not going to be. And you're not going to be.

25:45.820 --> 25:48.820
But I feel like I am. It's just so not like me.

25:48.820 --> 25:51.820
I don't know if I'm going to be the person I want to be.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.820
Honestly, it's like the lights have gone off,

25:53.820 --> 25:55.820
and it's really...

25:56.820 --> 25:58.820
..it's really quite alarming.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.820
Listen, you are not... Thank you.

26:05.820 --> 26:08.820
Listen, you are not leaving this island, right?

26:08.820 --> 26:10.820
For one, listen to me. But I do.

26:10.820 --> 26:14.820
Listen, you are not leaving this island to the fucking end game, right?

26:14.820 --> 26:19.820
I don't care if I have to carry you on my fucking back, and nor does she.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.820
And you would. And I would. Totally. And I would.

26:21.820 --> 26:22.820
I would.

26:26.820 --> 26:29.820
I'm really, really worried about Georgia Kay.

26:29.820 --> 26:32.820
Literally, I'm watching her deteriorate before my eyes.

26:32.820 --> 26:35.820
She's not eating the yucca, she's not very keen on the limpets,

26:35.820 --> 26:38.820
and I'm just really worried she's not going to make it, to be honest.

26:38.820 --> 26:42.820
The one thing we need for George is food.

26:42.820 --> 26:46.820
Who knows? Maybe we can get one more island miracle

26:46.820 --> 26:50.820
and turn George's fate around, which would be amazing.

26:51.820 --> 26:56.820
So far, all the women's attempts

26:56.820 --> 26:59.820
at hunting and fishing on the island have failed.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.820
Oh, look! Like pot noodle. Yeah.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.820
Desperately hungry, they've resorted to scavenging

27:05.820 --> 27:07.820
for nourishment on the beach.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.820
Budweiser!

27:09.820 --> 27:11.820
Full of sea water.

27:16.820 --> 27:18.820
What's that? Some perfume.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.820
Men's perfume. It's like that.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.820
Oh, now I'm getting horny!

27:26.820 --> 27:29.820
Oh, first time I've thought about a man.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.820
Jamie could hump this smell.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.820
Maybe if you wear that, I might start humping you. Oh, gosh.

27:37.820 --> 27:41.820
The women have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet for weeks,

27:41.820 --> 27:45.820
and the health of one of the group is causing grave concern.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.820
I'm really worried about George.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.820
She sleeps all the time, she's been sick.

27:50.820 --> 27:53.820
She's just not well.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.820
I don't know whether she's going to last.

27:56.820 --> 27:59.820
Who are we going to talk about food with?

28:03.820 --> 28:06.820
We can't afford to lose anyone else in this group.

28:08.820 --> 28:12.820
One rich source of food on the island is its bird life.

28:12.820 --> 28:16.820
Catching one of the island's larger birds could mean 2,000 calories

28:16.820 --> 28:18.820
to share with Georgina.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.820
Now, I have no idea if this will work.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.820
We can only try.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.820
Psychotherapist Havilah has fashioned a bird trap

28:28.820 --> 28:31.820
out of a stick, some string and a coconut.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.820
I'm going to put my trap in here.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.820
This is quite good territory.

28:37.820 --> 28:39.820
Birds are often flocking here.

28:39.820 --> 28:42.820
We don't want to get nice, pretty birds.

28:43.820 --> 28:47.820
But to lure her prey, she's going to need bait.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.820
Oh, there's a hermit crab.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.820
I don't want to do this.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.820
Not very good at machetes.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.820
Hello, beautiful.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.820
Go on, go to Daddy.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.820
One, two, three.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.820
My dad has been a pigeon racer from a young age,

29:06.820 --> 29:08.820
so I understand birds.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.820
I know how to handle them, I know what to do.

29:11.820 --> 29:13.820
And if it comes to it...

29:13.820 --> 29:15.820
I'll kill one.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.820
No, no, no, no, no.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.820
I wouldn't take any pleasure from it.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.820
I don't really want to kill anything,

29:21.820 --> 29:23.820
but I could if I'm hungry.

29:25.820 --> 29:28.820
In those situations, what needs to be done needs to be done.

29:36.820 --> 29:38.820
Yeah, I've done it, so I've killed it.

29:42.820 --> 29:45.820
Havilah will need to return in the morning.

29:46.820 --> 29:50.820
So dinner tonight will be once again a handful of limpets...

29:51.820 --> 29:53.820
..at around seven calories a pop.

29:53.820 --> 29:56.820
So I think we've got five each, I think.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.820
I don't know if you want to count them up.

29:58.820 --> 29:59.820
Whoa!

29:59.820 --> 30:00.820
Wow!

30:00.820 --> 30:02.820
Pop that in your mouth.

30:03.820 --> 30:04.820
Thank you, big horse.

30:04.820 --> 30:05.820
Well done.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.820
It's like a lollipop, I can't believe it.

30:09.820 --> 30:11.820
I know what it's like, and it's not a lollipop.

30:11.820 --> 30:13.820
From here, it looks like a bellend.

30:13.820 --> 30:14.820
Oh!

30:15.820 --> 30:17.820
This tastes like her boyfriend's ball.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.820
How I would imagine testicles taste.

30:23.820 --> 30:27.820
And those limpets, bloody hell, oh, my God.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.820
It reminded me of...

30:29.820 --> 30:33.820
..if I was to put my boyfriend's testicle in my mouth

30:33.820 --> 30:35.820
and take a bite...

30:36.820 --> 30:38.820
..like, a rubbery consistency

30:38.820 --> 30:41.820
and then a pop of, like, juice and goo,

30:41.820 --> 30:44.820
and, oh, my God, I now can't get that image out of my head.

30:45.820 --> 30:48.820
It makes me get thinking about it.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.820
By the way, she's never teabagged him.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.820
What does teabagging mean?

30:54.820 --> 30:57.820
Who's going to explain that one?

30:57.820 --> 30:59.820
Put the testicles in your mouth.

30:59.820 --> 31:00.820
Why?

31:00.820 --> 31:02.820
Why not?

31:05.820 --> 31:07.820
Oh, Gillian, you dirty bitch.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.820
Classy.

31:09.820 --> 31:11.820
WHISTLE BLOWS

31:11.820 --> 31:13.820
WHISTLE BLOWS

31:13.820 --> 31:15.820
WHISTLE BLOWS

31:17.820 --> 31:20.820
Another day, and once again, no breakfast.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.820
Who'd like some pancakes and bacon?

31:24.820 --> 31:26.820
Oh, damn.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.820
Pancakes, bacon, maple syrup...

31:32.820 --> 31:33.820
..stack.

31:37.820 --> 31:39.820
George, can I get you anything?

31:39.820 --> 31:42.820
Ravaged by hunger, Georgina is too frail to leave camp.

31:43.820 --> 31:44.820
I'm absolutely floored

31:44.820 --> 31:46.820
by what I can only presume is malnutrition.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.820
I don't want to be the one who's ill or sickly

31:48.820 --> 31:50.820
because I'm not that person at home.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.820
There's enough people who need feeding and drinking

31:52.820 --> 31:54.820
without just having a dead weight to carry.

31:55.820 --> 31:56.820
OK, so...

31:58.820 --> 32:00.820
..not nice, but if there is a birdie there,

32:00.820 --> 32:02.820
you need to take a knife.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.820
Havilah's bird tracking team

32:04.820 --> 32:06.820
is now looking for the birdie.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.820
They're looking for the birdie.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.820
They're looking for the birdie.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.820
They're looking for the birdie.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.820
Havilah's bird trap, if successful,

32:14.820 --> 32:16.820
could provide a much-needed meal.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.820
Have you killed birds before age?

32:19.820 --> 32:21.820
Yeah, but I don't like doing it.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.820
It kind of was enforced on me as a child.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.820
Insects have eaten my bait.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.820
Trial and error, Georgie, trial and error.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.820
But I need to go away and rethink it.

32:42.820 --> 32:45.820
I think we are actually starving, you know?

32:45.820 --> 32:47.820
You never sit at home and think,

32:47.820 --> 32:50.820
oh, I'll just have one limb pit today,

32:50.820 --> 32:52.820
or I won't eat today.

32:52.820 --> 32:54.820
I'll eat in three weeks.

32:54.820 --> 32:56.820
It just doesn't happen.

32:58.820 --> 33:00.820
With Havilah's bird trap a failure,

33:00.820 --> 33:03.820
there's no choice but to venture back into the jungle.

33:03.820 --> 33:06.820
We're going to set some pig traps

33:06.820 --> 33:09.820
so we can get some pigs.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.820
What's your favourite type of pork?

33:11.820 --> 33:14.820
I think it's got to be pulled pork, but done right.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.820
Having come so close to making a kill 24 hours ago,

33:18.820 --> 33:22.820
Laura and Beth and Belinda are back on the trail of the pig.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.820
Let's try and find some tracks and trap it up.

33:26.820 --> 33:30.820
It could be their only hope of keeping Georgina on the island.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.820
Here's the dead-eaten crab, isn't it?

33:32.820 --> 33:33.820
Mm-hm.

33:33.820 --> 33:35.820
It's been here snuffling.

33:35.820 --> 33:39.820
Stop on that branch right in front of you, darling.

33:39.820 --> 33:40.820
There's a massive bird.

33:40.820 --> 33:42.820
There's a massive boa.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.820
See this branch here?

33:44.820 --> 33:46.820
Look, at the top.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.820
Wow.

33:48.820 --> 33:49.820
Shall we try and catch it?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.820
Yes.

33:51.820 --> 33:53.820
I'm happy to go for him.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.820
The boa constrictor snake is a formidable foe.

33:56.820 --> 34:00.820
This guy will kill its prey by biting, grabbing,

34:00.820 --> 34:03.820
then rapping and suffocating,

34:03.820 --> 34:05.820
and then will swallow it whole.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.820
They're very fast, they can strike half their body length,

34:08.820 --> 34:10.820
and you do not want to get hurt.

34:10.820 --> 34:13.820
You want to get a snake bite in a survival situation.

34:13.820 --> 34:14.820
You see him?

34:14.820 --> 34:17.820
I think he's gone, actually, inside, going down,

34:17.820 --> 34:19.820
so he's probably going to come out in a minute.

34:22.820 --> 34:24.820
Well, he's out. He's coming down!

34:24.820 --> 34:25.820
He's out.

34:25.820 --> 34:27.820
OK, now he's in striking mode.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.820
The way to kill it is to pin its head.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.820
If you control the head, you control the body,

34:33.820 --> 34:36.820
and then either stave its head in with a rock

34:36.820 --> 34:38.820
or cut its head off with a machete.

34:38.820 --> 34:39.820
But if you can catch them,

34:39.820 --> 34:41.820
this is great survival food.

34:41.820 --> 34:44.820
Look at all the meat on this guy.

34:45.820 --> 34:46.820
Whoa!

34:46.820 --> 34:48.820
Right, there we go. There's your...

34:50.820 --> 34:52.820
Well done, Bish. Got him.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.820
Well done, well done, well done.

34:56.820 --> 34:57.820
I didn't get him.

34:57.820 --> 34:58.820
I didn't get him, I didn't get him.

34:58.820 --> 34:59.820
Oh, she didn't, she didn't.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.820
Man, you can even just do a machete on him.

35:03.820 --> 35:04.820
Hold.

35:04.820 --> 35:05.820
No.

35:07.820 --> 35:08.820
Hold.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.820
Good, good one, good one.

35:10.820 --> 35:12.820
Well done, well done, well done.

35:14.820 --> 35:17.820
OK, well done, guys. Well done, well done.

35:17.820 --> 35:19.820
High five!

35:19.820 --> 35:20.820
Yeah!

35:20.820 --> 35:25.820
We seized the opportunity and just went and did it.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.820
Oh, wow. Sorry, Mr Snake.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.820
Snake starters followed by limpets and snails.

35:31.820 --> 35:34.820
This is really going to lift the spirits on camp,

35:34.820 --> 35:36.820
which is great.

35:36.820 --> 35:37.820
Let's go home.

35:38.820 --> 35:40.820
I wonder when on our jungle trekking days

35:40.820 --> 35:44.820
how many things we went past without knowing.

35:47.820 --> 35:48.820
Guys?

35:48.820 --> 35:49.820
Yeah?

35:49.820 --> 35:50.820
Guys?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.820
Come back here really fucking slowly.

35:52.820 --> 35:53.820
Where are you?

35:53.820 --> 35:55.820
Shh!

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
Don't shout.

35:56.820 --> 35:57.820
There, there, there, there, there.

35:57.820 --> 35:58.820
There.

35:58.820 --> 35:59.820
You see it?

35:59.820 --> 36:00.820
Oh, yeah.

36:00.820 --> 36:01.820
A pig.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.820
Fucking hell.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.820
Is it dead?

36:10.820 --> 36:11.820
It's not dead.

36:11.820 --> 36:13.820
It's just closed its eyes.

36:13.820 --> 36:14.820
Here's the thing.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.820
Do we jump it now?

36:16.820 --> 36:17.820
Yep.

36:17.820 --> 36:19.820
I don't know.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.820
It seems like too much of a gift from the gods.

36:21.820 --> 36:22.820
I'm not going to do it.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.820
He's right here.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.820
Basically, it's me.

36:26.820 --> 36:28.820
I'm going to go for the head.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.820
I'm going to go for the trunk.

36:30.820 --> 36:34.820
Right now, I'm trying to get the noose around his neck.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.820
They're going to come in straight out

36:36.820 --> 36:39.820
and tie his face together.

36:39.820 --> 36:45.820
If they need it, smack with a rock in front of them.

36:45.820 --> 36:47.820
We can't always stay in.

36:47.820 --> 36:49.820
We don't have the fucking game room.

36:49.820 --> 36:50.820
We're strong.

36:50.820 --> 36:51.820
We're big.

36:51.820 --> 36:52.820
We're clean.

36:52.820 --> 36:53.820
We're good.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.820
I'm not going to think about it.

36:55.820 --> 36:56.820
Yeah, of course.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.820
Yeah.

37:06.820 --> 37:19.820
We can't always stay in.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.820
We don't have the fucking game room.

37:21.820 --> 37:23.820
A hunting party led by Lauren

37:23.820 --> 37:25.820
has stumbled across a sleeping pig

37:25.820 --> 37:27.820
in the middle of the jungle.

37:29.820 --> 37:32.820
It could offer salvation for Georgina,

37:32.820 --> 37:34.820
who's desperately malnourished.

37:34.820 --> 37:35.820
The law of the jungle

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820
really is rooted in opportunity,

37:37.820 --> 37:39.820
and you've got to take your chances when you can.

37:39.820 --> 37:42.820
The women need to learn from passing decisions.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.820
Just seize the moment.

37:44.820 --> 37:45.820
The stakes are high.

37:45.820 --> 37:46.820
If they fail,

37:46.820 --> 37:49.820
the group are going to slide further into starvation.

37:51.820 --> 37:52.820
Are we committed?

37:52.820 --> 37:53.820
Yeah.

37:53.820 --> 37:54.820
100%?

37:54.820 --> 37:55.820
Yeah.

37:55.820 --> 37:56.820
100%?

37:56.820 --> 37:57.820
Yeah.

37:57.820 --> 37:58.820
OK.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.820
This time, they're prepared

37:59.820 --> 38:01.820
and have sharp weapons for the kill.

38:05.820 --> 38:06.820
OK.

38:06.820 --> 38:07.820
Let's go.

38:07.820 --> 38:08.820
Let's go.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.820
Let's go.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.820
Let's go.

38:12.820 --> 38:13.820
Let's go.

38:13.820 --> 38:14.820
Let's go.

38:14.820 --> 38:15.820
All right.

38:15.820 --> 38:16.820
OK.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.820
All right.

38:17.820 --> 38:18.820
All right.

38:18.820 --> 38:19.820
All right.

38:19.820 --> 38:20.820
OK.

38:20.820 --> 38:21.820
Wait a minute.

38:21.820 --> 38:22.820
I've got to get my hand to the door.

38:22.820 --> 38:23.820
OK.

38:23.820 --> 38:24.820
All right.

38:24.820 --> 38:25.820
OK.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.820
Wait.

38:26.820 --> 38:27.820
Let's go.

38:27.820 --> 38:28.820
Yeah.

38:28.820 --> 38:29.820
What are we going to do?

38:29.820 --> 38:30.820
Let's go.

38:30.820 --> 38:31.820
We're going to take your chance.

38:31.820 --> 38:32.820
OK.

38:32.820 --> 38:33.820
Whatever.

38:33.820 --> 38:34.820
All right.

38:34.820 --> 39:04.220
Okay, everyone? Everyone okay?

39:04.220 --> 39:06.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. You okay, Beth?

39:06.900 --> 39:08.900
Yeah.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.220
Okay, I'm just gonna put the knife to the side, out of the way.

39:11.220 --> 39:14.220
And we'll just wait. We'll just wait.

39:14.220 --> 39:16.220
Oh, gosh, that's horrible.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.220
You're amazing, Laura.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.220
It's amazing what that looks like.

39:23.220 --> 39:26.220
It's fucked up.

39:26.220 --> 39:28.220
I don't know why I'm laughing. It's nerves.

39:28.220 --> 39:30.220
It's complete adrenaline.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.220
Oh, wow.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.220
Good work, team.

39:37.220 --> 39:39.220
It's quite amazing, wasn't it, really?

39:39.220 --> 39:41.220
I'll never forget this.

39:41.220 --> 39:43.220
What a day.

39:47.220 --> 39:51.220
That's the most intense thing

39:51.220 --> 39:57.220
that has ever fucking happened to me in my entire life.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.220
It was something that was almost caveman-like.

40:00.220 --> 40:03.220
We just sort of behaved in this really uniform way

40:03.220 --> 40:06.220
that I never thought that I had in me.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.220
Whoa!

40:10.220 --> 40:13.220
And now we're gonna eat every single morsel,

40:13.220 --> 40:17.220
not let one ounce of that little piggy go to waste.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.220
H, we caught the pig.

40:19.220 --> 40:21.220
Are you kidding? No.

40:21.220 --> 40:23.220
That's what that is over there.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.220
Are you kidding? I'm not fucking kidding.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.220
Oh, my God, mind blown. I don't know what to say.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.220
Thank you. Thank you!

40:30.220 --> 40:32.220
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have...

40:32.220 --> 40:34.220
Oh!

40:34.220 --> 40:36.220
I'm so excited!

40:38.220 --> 40:40.220
Jeez, Louise!

40:40.220 --> 40:42.220
Yep.

40:42.220 --> 40:44.220
And, Harvey, we have a starter.

40:44.220 --> 40:48.220
Oh, my God, I've just seen it in that bucket.

40:48.220 --> 40:50.220
Starters and me.

40:50.220 --> 40:53.220
Do you know what? You guys, you're just more of a woman

40:53.220 --> 40:55.220
than I'll ever be, all of you.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.220
Did you hear, George? Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

40:58.220 --> 41:00.220
Shit.

41:00.220 --> 41:01.220
And...

41:01.220 --> 41:03.220
My adrenaline is, like, through the roof.

41:03.220 --> 41:05.220
Does it really get quite in the trap?

41:05.220 --> 41:07.220
No, I was fast asleep and jumped it. Never.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.220
Oh, my God.

41:09.220 --> 41:13.220
For 34-year-old Georgina, the pig means more than just dinner.

41:15.220 --> 41:17.220
Bloody hell, it's massive.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.220
I'm just so made up. We've got food.

41:21.220 --> 41:23.220
Oh, crap, I'm so happy.

41:25.220 --> 41:29.220
I can't tell you the feeling of absolute relief

41:29.220 --> 41:33.220
that's just run through my entire body

41:33.220 --> 41:37.220
at the thought of having some food.

41:37.220 --> 41:40.220
Lauren and Beth obviously do an incredible job.

41:40.220 --> 41:42.220
I just can't believe it.

41:44.220 --> 41:46.220
I could not have done that two and a half, three weeks ago.

41:46.220 --> 41:49.220
If you'd have put me on the island and I'd have seen that ball,

41:49.220 --> 41:52.220
I would have done my absolute most to stay away from it.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.220
But I'm hungry now,

41:54.220 --> 41:58.220
and my mind is not the same mind.

41:58.220 --> 42:00.220
As it was three weeks ago.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.220
The fire's all toasting, ready for it.

42:05.220 --> 42:10.220
Even the vegetarian in the group, Jamie, is relieved for Georgina.

42:10.220 --> 42:13.220
I love it. It's brilliant.

42:23.220 --> 42:26.220
They have big legs on that thing, aren't they?

42:26.220 --> 42:27.220
Lots of big legs.

42:27.220 --> 42:30.220
I'm going to be on the bottom of me tonight.

42:31.220 --> 42:35.220
The women will now have to butcher, skin and carve their kill.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.220
It's not pleasant.

42:37.220 --> 42:39.220
Dead pig smells.

42:39.220 --> 42:42.220
Inside, I'm like...

42:42.220 --> 42:44.220
You're going to be sick.

42:44.220 --> 42:46.220
I've got to do it to survive.

42:46.220 --> 42:47.220
Oh, dear.

42:47.220 --> 42:49.220
A little bit of shit came out.

42:50.220 --> 42:52.220
I'm starving, are you?

42:58.220 --> 43:03.220
The pig will provide the women with roughly 50,000 calories.

43:03.220 --> 43:06.220
Some fat, if anyone wants some fat.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.220
For the first time, they have more food

43:13.220 --> 43:15.220
than they can possibly eat in one sitting.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.220
How is it, George?

43:17.220 --> 43:19.220
Warm.

43:19.220 --> 43:22.220
We have not eaten like this for, like, over three weeks,

43:22.220 --> 43:25.220
and, my God, it's been a long time coming.

43:25.220 --> 43:27.220
Could you buy that in a restaurant?

43:27.220 --> 43:29.220
That fresh, that's rib.

43:29.220 --> 43:32.220
Let's literally get the meat in my mouth now

43:32.220 --> 43:34.220
and don't take it away.

43:34.220 --> 43:36.220
Mmm.

43:36.220 --> 43:40.220
Harvey, I can see you eating that with your eyes closed.

43:43.220 --> 43:45.220
Are you having an orgasm while you're eating it?

43:45.220 --> 43:48.220
Do you know what? I've never experienced this in my life.

43:48.220 --> 43:50.220
I feel like a savage.

43:50.220 --> 43:54.220
I've had so little calories in me every day,

43:54.220 --> 43:59.220
and this pig may be my salvation.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.220
You're going to turn it round now.

44:01.220 --> 44:03.220
This will help you.

44:03.220 --> 44:06.220
I've been rescued by the pig hunters.

44:06.220 --> 44:09.220
My mother would be appalled if she saw me eating like this.

44:10.220 --> 44:12.220
Sorry, Mum.

44:12.220 --> 44:15.220
The pork's providing the women with a valuable source

44:15.220 --> 44:18.220
of protein, fat, vitamins, minerals,

44:18.220 --> 44:21.220
but more importantly, it's giving them what I call

44:21.220 --> 44:23.220
the golden window of opportunity.

44:23.220 --> 44:26.220
The women have about three days to capitalise on that win.

44:26.220 --> 44:29.220
This is their chance to improve their quality of life

44:29.220 --> 44:32.220
and use that energy to regroup and hunt again.

44:32.220 --> 44:34.220
Hello, Mr Snake.

44:34.220 --> 44:36.220
Hello, Mr Snake.

44:36.220 --> 44:37.220
Look at that.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.220
Now for the second course.

44:39.220 --> 44:41.220
How are you feeling, Hobbs? Do you want to do it?

44:41.220 --> 44:43.220
I'm going to do it. Go for it.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.220
And despite her screamishness,

44:45.220 --> 44:47.220
Havilah has volunteered to skin the snake.

44:47.220 --> 44:49.220
Oh, look at that.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.220
It's his oesophagus.

44:51.220 --> 44:52.220
What it is?

44:52.220 --> 44:56.220
I love to stuff a turkey at Christmas,

44:56.220 --> 44:58.220
and it means you've got to get in the skin.

44:58.220 --> 45:00.220
Ready? Like a sock.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.220
Come on. Ready? There we go.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.220
Wow. So, yeah, go very slow.

45:04.220 --> 45:06.220
Yeah, got it.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.220
Amazing.

45:08.220 --> 45:11.220
I've just skinned a boa constrictor.

45:11.220 --> 45:14.220
I'd never do that in my real life.

45:14.220 --> 45:17.220
Well done. Not many girls could do that, you know.

45:17.220 --> 45:19.220
Yeah. Not many.

45:19.220 --> 45:21.220
And if anybody judges any of the girls,

45:21.220 --> 45:23.220
here, for what they've done today,

45:23.220 --> 45:25.220
they can fuck off.

45:27.220 --> 45:30.220
I've been able to help everyone today,

45:30.220 --> 45:33.220
and I'm really proud of that.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.220
An incredible day.

45:35.220 --> 45:37.220
Emotionally draining.

45:37.220 --> 45:40.220
But the end result is that we have food,

45:40.220 --> 45:44.220
and we'll be able to keep going for that bit longer.

45:44.220 --> 45:47.220
Next time on The Women's Island...

45:47.220 --> 45:49.220
Oh, my God!

45:49.220 --> 45:51.220
That is the biggest shocker I've ever seen.

45:51.220 --> 45:53.220
People are not prioritising the water,

45:53.220 --> 45:55.220
and it's pissing me off.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.220
The group is completely on their arse.

45:57.220 --> 45:59.220
Julie! Julie!

45:59.220 --> 46:01.220
I'm so weak.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.220
We're going to have to pull the plug on this,

46:04.220 --> 46:07.220
and I've got to think about removing you all from the island.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.220
Boy, I love your skill.

46:19.220 --> 46:20.220
Fine, let's have some tea on that.

46:20.220 --> 46:22.220
Let's have some food but only at the hotel.

46:22.220 --> 46:23.220
Thank you.

46:23.220 --> 46:24.220
Oh, my God.

46:24.220 --> 46:27.220
This is insane, really Rosa.

46:27.220 --> 46:28.220
All right, everybody.

46:28.220 --> 46:29.220
There it is.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.220
I like it.

46:30.220 --> 46:32.220
You're on theου

46:32.220 --> 46:33.220
I like it.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.220
Oh, wow.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.220
Oh, wow.

46:35.220 --> 46:36.220
Seriously.

46:36.220 --> 46:37.220
I'm so killing it.

46:37.220 --> 46:40.220
Irene, I want to go to the pool to see if my pod is cleaned up.

46:40.220 --> 46:42.220
Well, I think we should go.

46:42.220 --> 46:44.220
We were playing a game

46:44.220 --> 46:45.220
and the only thing we were able to do

46:45.220 --> 46:46.220
was bring Universal Neoер.
