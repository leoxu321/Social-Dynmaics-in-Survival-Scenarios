00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one is inhabited by 14 British

00:15.000 --> 00:25.620
men while a separate island is home to 14 British women for six weeks they'll be utterly alone with

00:25.620 --> 00:33.500
only the clothes they stand up in and a handful of basic tools filming everything themselves

00:33.500 --> 00:43.860
when pushed to the limits of human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the

00:43.860 --> 00:54.900
Windsor day who will have what it takes to stay alive tonight we follow the women's island

00:55.620 --> 01:09.180
survival will be harder than ever the search for water and hunt for food is now a matter of life or

01:09.180 --> 01:21.840
death living on the island in the middle of tropical storm season when pitted against the

01:21.840 --> 01:25.600
extremes of nature and the

01:25.600 --> 01:31.960
these Monday women got what it takes to survive your bodies are just starting to fail I'm right on

01:31.960 --> 01:36.280
the brink of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons over

01:40.240 --> 01:42.220
foreign

01:49.600 --> 01:55.240
get the knife get the knife first 10 women remain of the 14 I dropped off

01:55.600 --> 02:00.940
on the remote Pacific Island you are not leaving this island I don't care if I have to carry you on

02:00.940 --> 02:05.860
my back as they approach the four-week mark they're entering a new and potentially dangerous

02:05.860 --> 02:11.200
phase of the experiment I just don't find starvation a sexy weight to get skinny without

02:11.200 --> 02:17.080
enough food and water their bodies could be in serious danger of shutting down I think it's

02:17.080 --> 02:22.660
about time that we get out there and get a bit brutal yesterday the women finally managed to

02:22.660 --> 02:24.220
trap their first big prey

02:25.600 --> 02:34.560
and ate their biggest meal yet anybody watches this in judges any of the girls here for what they've done today they can fuck all

02:34.560 --> 02:40.740
it's day 26

02:40.740 --> 02:43.620
oh

02:43.620 --> 02:46.360
what's that it's moving

02:46.360 --> 02:50.600
i knew there was things here that tried to burrow into your skin

02:50.600 --> 02:55.240
don't worry about hurting me just get it out

02:55.600 --> 02:59.600
The plague of parasites from yesterday's pig carcass has hit camp.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
Basically, camp is in festivities.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.600
Oh, Christ.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.600
Let's wash down and we'll basically give each other a visual check.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.600
Who says we don't have to take our clothes off to have a good time?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.600
Hello!

03:13.600 --> 03:15.600
She looks a bit angry.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.600
She was angry a bit, didn't she?

03:17.600 --> 03:20.600
Turns out I've had a tick right on my bum.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.600
It's made a right mess.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.600
I've got one there a bit. It's got its head in there.

03:25.600 --> 03:30.600
These blood-sucking insects burrow their heads deep under the skin to feed,

03:30.600 --> 03:34.600
exposing the women to a host of dangerous tropical diseases.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.600
And as I went like that with my fingernail,

03:37.600 --> 03:43.600
the arse ends of this tick came up with its legs moving.

03:43.600 --> 03:48.600
Well, I've... Oh, God, it knocked me sick.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.600
Two, three.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
OK.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
I think it's piggies' revenge.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.600
Despite their recent pig kill,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.600
the women now have been living on an extreme low-calorie diet

04:05.600 --> 04:08.600
with very little water for the past four weeks.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.600
From here, there's barely any research

04:10.600 --> 04:13.600
about the effects of extreme survival on the body.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.600
And because of this, they're now entering dangerous medical territory.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.600
Without an adequate and constant supply of food and water,

04:21.600 --> 04:24.600
they're going to risk long-term damage to their vital organs,

04:24.600 --> 04:26.600
and they don't want that.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.600
Like that?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.600
Yeah. It caught the pig.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.600
We cooked it as well, and now we're staying up all night

04:34.600 --> 04:38.600
to preserve it in salt water from the sea

04:38.600 --> 04:42.600
so that everybody can eat meat for the next three days.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.600
Hunters Lauren and Beth, along with Havilah and Becky,

04:45.600 --> 04:50.600
are working through the night to ensure they make the most of yesterday's pig kill.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.600
Hey, that's island life.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.600
While they're doing that, we are going to dig a hole in the ground

04:56.600 --> 04:58.600
to bury the jerrycan.

04:58.600 --> 05:03.600
So it's going to be a bit like a fridge, but a fridge for, like, cavemen.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.600
With temperatures in excess of 30 degrees,

05:06.600 --> 05:09.600
the coolest place to store the meat is underground.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.600
Let's get it as deep as we can.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.600
To do this, Lauren and Beth have requisitioned

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
one of the women's two jerrycans,

05:17.600 --> 05:20.600
which, up to this point, has been used to filter, boil,

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
and store their drinking water.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.600
Um, I'm kind of not happy about that.

05:25.600 --> 05:30.600
Which is a cause of concern for lifelong vegetarian Jamie.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600
I know it's quite a big deal,

05:32.600 --> 05:37.600
but it's also quite a big deal for me drinking water.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.600
There's no way I'm drinking out of that.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.600
It's got to be done.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
People must be fed.

05:50.600 --> 05:58.600
I'm a bit devastated about still being awake at this time in the morning.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.600
This is not the same as tottering in at 5am on a pair of heels,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
really, really drunk.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.600
Having worked through the night,

06:06.600 --> 06:11.600
the pig preservers head back to camp with the jerrycan filled with pork.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.600
I think people have their priorities wrong.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.600
I'm not saying that they shouldn't have done that to preserve the pig,

06:19.600 --> 06:23.600
because I also didn't want the pig to go to waste.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.600
I mean, I know I'm a vegetarian, so it's easy for me to say,

06:27.600 --> 06:32.600
but it's almost like that was prioritised over our water,

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
and that's what I'm pissed off about.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
OK, we're just going to cover this valve,

06:36.600 --> 06:39.600
because we don't want any little nasties.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.600
On the island, Jamie's helped establish

06:42.600 --> 06:45.600
a successful water purification system,

06:45.600 --> 06:47.600
using one jerrycan for filtering

06:47.600 --> 06:49.600
and the other jerrycan for cleaning.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.600
The jerrycan is a kettle for boiling.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.600
It's fucked up the whole water system.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.600
I've been sitting there for days doing it.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
One jerrycan, get it on the boil.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.600
Filter in the other jerrycan, get that on the boil.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.600
And even then, we're struggling with the water.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.600
Now we've got one shitty jerrycan without a lid.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
So now I'm suffering.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
Midday.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.600
With tonight's dinner stored in their makeshift fridge,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
the women who stayed up preserving the pig

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
are resting on the beach.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
You smell so clean.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
No, I don't.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
I'm sniffing you.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.600
55-year-old Julie is hard at work,

07:28.600 --> 07:31.600
determined to supplement the women's dinner.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
She's spotted a dead fish.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.600
What I'm going to do is...

07:38.600 --> 07:42.600
..I'm going to tie this up and tie it to my ankle

07:42.600 --> 07:44.600
and see if anything else comes to eat it

07:44.600 --> 07:46.600
that I can scoop up in my kiddie net.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
What a lacking talent.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.600
I make up for in enthusiasm.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.600
My mum used to say that.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
Oh, Julie.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
8.62 altogether.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.600
I'm single, divorced.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
I've bought the house.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.600
This is my second house that I've bought.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.600
And I've done it all on my own.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.600
I think I'm hard-working.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.600
Once I start, I'll really give it, you know,

08:10.600 --> 08:12.600
till I'm absolutely dropping.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.600
It's like I'm behind myself with a big stick all the time.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.600
I don't give myself a break.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
Just be careful.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.600
I don't want a shark taking your leg off.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.600
This is the strangest fishing I've ever seen.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
Julie is killing me.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.600
I absolutely love her.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
I'll keep throwing it out like a distressed fish.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.600
I don't know anything about fishing.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
I could be a couple of hours.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.600
I'll give you the show.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
I'll give you the show.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
Oh, Julie.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
Further down the beach...

08:50.600 --> 08:52.600
Give me a really good chunk towards you.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.600
..Jamie's made a discovery

08:54.600 --> 08:56.600
that could make her water more palatable.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
That is lime leaves, isn't it? Yeah.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.600
I've been picking heaps and heaps of these lime leaves

09:02.600 --> 09:04.600
and putting it in this boiled water.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.600
It just takes away some of that rotten taste.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
Totally tropical taste.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.600
No.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.600
LAUGHTER

09:15.600 --> 09:19.600
I'm fucking determined we're going to get something out of this ocean.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.600
On the shoreline, Julie is still hard at it.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
No, she didn't!

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
Yeah! Go, Julie!

09:32.600 --> 09:33.600
Wow.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.600
No, she just lost it!

09:37.600 --> 09:39.600
Fish fell back in the water.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.600
I just fucking despair, I do, honest to God.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.600
2pm. Julie is still fishing.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.600
Have you ever seen anyone fish like that before in your life?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
No.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.600
I don't think any fish could have gone here.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
LAUGHTER

09:57.600 --> 10:00.600
Whilst the rest of the women are more interested in sunbathing

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
and relaxing on the beach.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.600
Oh!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
This is why we came here.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.600
This bay is an absolute dream, isn't it?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.600
Woo!

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
Exhausted!

10:13.600 --> 10:17.600
Beth and Lauren wake to discover none of the other women have done any work.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.600
We've dayed up, we cooked breakfast for everybody,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.600
we cooked supper for everybody,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
and then we needed kind of a little bit of a break today,

10:23.600 --> 10:26.600
and because we've had a break, everybody else has had a fucking break,

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
and nothing's happened.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.600
Do you know what?

10:29.600 --> 10:34.600
Sometimes I find this island sends me round the fucking bend.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.600
Everyone was agreeing, you know,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.600
you guys need to have a bit more of a chill day.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.600
Well, everyone seems to have taken that as everybody's going to have a relaxing day.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.600
So we're back at 4 o'clock in the evening.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.600
There's no wood for the fire.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.600
Just feel like everyone's taking the piss, really.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.600
So infuriating.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.600
I mean, in a minute, Lauren and I are going to start cooking again.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.600
On the preserved meat, and I guarantee you,

10:58.600 --> 11:00.600
people that have been doing fuck-all all day

11:00.600 --> 11:02.600
are going to be sitting front row and going,

11:02.600 --> 11:05.600
all yum-yum-yum, eating all the big bits.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.600
And that is just winding my fucking bobbin up.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.600
MUSIC PLAYS

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
Oh, my God.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.600
Mmm, that smells funky, doesn't it?

11:16.600 --> 11:20.600
Lauren and Beth have dug up the jerrycan of preserved meat.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.600
I mean, that jerrycan does smell of fucking vomit, though, doesn't it?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.600
I think it's borderline.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.600
It goes off very quickly, doesn't it?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.600
With no other food collected during the day,

11:31.600 --> 11:34.600
the women risk eating the suspect pork.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.600
Come and grab a coconut bowl and fill up.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
What do you think, girls?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.600
I think it's going to be good.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
It's going to be good.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.600
What do you think, girls?

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
Mmm.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
It doesn't taste right, does it?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
It makes you feel a bit ill.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.600
It is absolutely disgusting.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
Like, it tastes gross.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
It's disgusting.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
But, you know, when it's the only thing you've got to eat...

11:57.600 --> 11:59.600
The pork may have been foul,

11:59.600 --> 12:03.600
but at least Jamie's flavoured lime water has hit the spot.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
Oh, my God, Jamie, it's so good.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.600
That was really exciting.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.600
It's the best thing ever. Oh!

12:11.600 --> 12:15.600
That's almost better than cunnilingus.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.600
I don't like them being down there.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
What?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
I get scared.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.600
I don't... Like, what the fuck are they doing?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.600
And their little beady eyes.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.600
Don't like it. Don't like it at all.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.600
I'm like, get up, get up!

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
Oh, my God.

12:41.600 --> 12:45.600
Excuse the farting.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
What's that fucking smell?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
I know, it's awful.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.600
Last night, the women ate the rancid preserved pork,

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
but it's backfired on them this morning.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
God, that was awful.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.600
I'm going to have to go.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.600
Oh, no, you're not going to be safe, are you?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.600
I don't know. I don't feel very well.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.600
Sorry!

13:04.600 --> 13:07.600
I'm basically shitting myself,

13:07.600 --> 13:09.600
and I've no idea when it's going to happen,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
and I have 30 seconds to go.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.600
Basically, then what happens is that you have explosive water,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.600
diarrhoea coming out of you.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
Twice now I haven't been able to make it,

13:23.600 --> 13:28.600
and I've had to bring back, like, my soiled pants and wash them.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.600
Harvey, can you take this... I'll take the head.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
Can you take the white thing for me?

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
With the preserved pork no longer edible,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
the women remove the pig's remains

13:37.600 --> 13:39.600
and jerrycan a pewter.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.600
This is the first time they've taken the jerrycan

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
and the pitted meat from the camp.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
It's rancid.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
Is the head in here?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.600
Rotting head.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
Fucking tick!

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
I think we just ditched all of this shit.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
Yeah, none of it's moving back.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
We don't need that canister, we don't need any of this.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.600
I don't need this in my life right now!

13:59.600 --> 14:02.600
Unconvinced they could salvage a rancid jerrycan

14:02.600 --> 14:05.600
and use it to purify the water again,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
the women throw it away.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
Oh, sorry.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
I'm coming out.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.600
I've learned from experience that big disasters

14:12.600 --> 14:15.600
are often made up of quite small mistakes,

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
but they have consequences,

14:17.600 --> 14:19.600
and it sets off like a chain reaction,

14:19.600 --> 14:22.600
and that chain can be very hard to break.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.600
Now, with only one jerrycan to produce all their water,

14:25.600 --> 14:30.600
the women are unknowingly heading towards a dehydration crisis.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.600
We've lost half our buckets and half our containers now.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.600
But we'll find more buckets and containers.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
We couldn't possibly have brought those back.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
I mean, they were just a rack.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.600
In one stroke, the women have halved the amount of drinking water

14:44.600 --> 14:47.600
they can produce and have permanently disrupted

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
their purification system.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.600
Vegetarian Jamie is unimpressed.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
I'm not happy.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.600
That's how much water I've got left.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.600
I had that in this morning, so that's all I've drank today.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.600
I'm pissed off at the fucking situation.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.600
And I think I've got PNT.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
Uh-oh.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
Yeah.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.600
Four weeks in,

15:12.600 --> 15:15.600
and the women are entering uncharted survival territory.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.600
It's fucking hard.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.600
Like, it's not a joke. It's really hard.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.600
And I miss everybody.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.600
I miss my family so much,

15:23.600 --> 15:27.600
and I miss my boyfriend so much and my best friend so much,

15:27.600 --> 15:31.600
and all I want to do is, you know, have something substantial to eat

15:31.600 --> 15:35.600
or have some water that doesn't taste like the bottom of a swamp.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.600
But I just keep telling myself I have to keep pushing on.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.600
The women have unwittingly put themselves at risk of dehydration

15:45.600 --> 15:48.600
after discarding a contaminated jerry can.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
It means they can now only boil and purify half the amount of drinking water.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
When that happened yesterday, I was like...

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
Yeah.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
She lost it.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.600
Don't ask for much, do you?

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
Coconut's a problem.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
Exactly.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.600
Jamie is furious with the other women and decides to take drastic action.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
I'm really annoyed, actually.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
I'm going on strike now.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.600
I'm going to do what I want, when I want.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.600
I'm not doing anything else apart from the water.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.600
Because I cannot live without water.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
Rolling!

16:23.600 --> 16:25.600
Jamie has withdrawn her labour from the group

16:25.600 --> 16:28.600
and will now only do the one job that benefits her,

16:28.600 --> 16:31.600
collecting and purifying the water.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.600
I'm going to be water bitch.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.600
Because nobody else gets a shit.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
I don't understand.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
Where do you think it fucking comes from?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
A tap?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
I work on my own now,

16:43.600 --> 16:47.600
so it's quite fun not having anybody to tell me what to do.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.600
I don't really like anybody bossing me about.

16:50.600 --> 16:55.600
On the island, ideally, I would really like a fun bunch of girls.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
Anyone that took themselves too seriously,

16:58.600 --> 17:00.600
I would find that a bit difficult.

17:00.600 --> 17:07.600
It's just a never-ending circle of chores to be done.

17:07.600 --> 17:12.600
In camp, the women are working through their long list of daily jobs.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.600
We have basic chores that have to be done on a daily basis

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
or else we won't survive.

17:17.600 --> 17:22.600
Getting wood for the fire, getting water and finding food.

17:22.600 --> 17:26.600
And if we don't succeed in those, everything goes to hell in a handguard.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.600
After this, I'm going to filter the water.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.600
I'm going to filter the water and then I'm going to have a bath,

17:33.600 --> 17:38.600
brush my teeth, wash my clothes, chill out.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.600
Surviving takes hard graft

17:40.600 --> 17:43.600
and everyone working together as a community.

17:43.600 --> 17:48.600
You've got to do all you can to keep a group cohesive and together,

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
because when it's together, it's strong.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.600
It's not strong when it's fragmented and broken.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.600
Definitely have more water than you.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
You bitch.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
You talk too much.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
Shut up.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
You took the bag off.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
You shouldn't have seen mine.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.600
The water wonderers return.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.600
Jamie starts purifying the water.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.600
It's a process that takes up to three hours

18:11.600 --> 18:16.600
but will now only produce one can's worth of water to drink.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
I feel like I'm going to faint.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
Julie and Havilah have moved on to their next job of the day,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
collecting firewood.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.600
Is that hard work, girls?

18:25.600 --> 18:28.600
So hard work.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
I have to sit down.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.600
Down all the way.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
Drained?

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
Drained.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.600
My mum had an expression and it's very true.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.600
Only willing horses get work to death.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.600
My mum used to say that.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
Dead now.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.600
She was work to death.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
She was.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.600
You've got some colour, Jamie.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Good.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.600
I'm going to bed in the Scottish again.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
2pm.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
While the other women remain hard at work,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.600
Jamie is relaxing on the beach and it hasn't gone unnoticed.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.600
I feel like I haven't stopped today.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.600
Like, it's one job after the other after the other.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
It's how it is.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
Being here, you've just got to be so busy.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
You've got to work as a team as well.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
I know.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
I know.

19:23.600 --> 19:28.600
I struggle to understand how some people function

19:28.600 --> 19:30.600
on just doing one thing a day.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.600
Hey, tits McGee!

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
Who the fuck thought?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.600
Jamie again, sunbathing on the beach.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.600
There is a large handful of us that work solidly the whole time.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
Not for ourselves, though.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
For the whole team.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
So the whole team can benefit from it.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
I'm no good.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
I'm no good.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
Not everyone can benefit from it.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
I'm naked here.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
Stop filming me.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.600
And not everyone has that same level of responsibility

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
and it's a joke.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.600
Jamie is so annoying.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.600
If she hadn't have gone and got water,

20:06.600 --> 20:09.600
then she would have done absolutely nothing for the whole day.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.600
Especially cos there's so much to do right now.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
It just made me really frustrated and angry.

20:15.600 --> 20:20.600
Kind of a little bit like, where's the fucking team spirit gone, man?

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
Bike meeting!

20:21.600 --> 20:26.600
Something had to be said because I was getting fucked off.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.600
We are a small group now.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.600
There's only ten of us.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
And so we need everybody to be hands on deck.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
And that isn't happening.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
It's becoming really obvious, like,

20:37.600 --> 20:40.600
that certain people are doing lots of things

20:40.600 --> 20:44.600
and sometimes I do feel like some people aren't doing as much.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
Everybody is naked.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
Everybody is naked.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
Everybody is naked.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
Everybody is naked.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
Everybody is naked.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
Everybody is naked.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
Everybody is naked.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
Everybody is depleted of energy in a way.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.600
Get over that and accept that everyone has to pull their weight.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.600
Does everyone feel like they are contributing the same?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
That's what I would want.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
Well, I do.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
I do, yeah, actually.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
I don't like sitting here, and people are making out,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
as if some people are being lazy in the camp

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
and not pulling their weight.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
It's not just a one-job day, which is my thing.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
No, of course not.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
But, you know, the jobs continue.

21:18.600 --> 21:23.600
There are certain jobs that I don't feel that I actually need to partake in.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
What do you mean by that?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
I can help with things that will benefit me.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.600
That means anything to do with water.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.600
But things that won't benefit me?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
No, I don't care.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
It's just crazy, crazy talk.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.600
It's just the lack of acknowledgement that, in fact,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
they weren't pulling their weight.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
How can you be so selfish?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.600
How can you not give a shit about anybody else?

21:46.600 --> 21:50.600
I mean, it's just complete bullshit.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.600
I don't like getting told what to do and when to do it.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.600
So if I want to lie down and sunbathe for an hour,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.600
everybody else can fuck off.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.600
Lauren's upset, Jamie's upset.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.600
Interesting they've heard them both say

22:03.600 --> 22:05.600
that they've been bullied by the other one.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.600
I just think they should just hug it out.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.600
Hug it out over a nice glass of warm swamp water.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.600
With all the infighting, they've not noticed

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
that the water supply is dwindling.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
It's turning to a standstill.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.600
Realistically, the women need to drink

22:19.600 --> 22:21.600
about three litres of water a day.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
At the moment, with only one jerrycan,

22:23.600 --> 22:26.600
they're averaging just one, and you can't sustain that.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
Maybe a little drop more, darling?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
Today, Jamie has managed to boil and filter

22:34.600 --> 22:36.600
the one remaining jerrycan,

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
but water is already running low.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.600
Doesn't look very much to me.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
No, it's not much at all.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.600
With not enough water to go round,

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
Julie and Georgina take the line

22:46.600 --> 22:49.600
to the last cup before leaving camp to go fishing.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
There's only so much water in a jerrycan,

22:51.600 --> 22:55.600
and it just so happens that you are at the back of the queue

22:55.600 --> 22:57.600
because you're doing other things

22:57.600 --> 22:59.600
and you don't get to fill up your bottle,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
then there's barely any water left for you.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
I've got a nice bit of tangled net here,

23:03.600 --> 23:05.600
which I'm going to try and get some crabs with.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.600
Good, good.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.600
Did you get your water?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.600
Yeah, to me. Have you got yours?

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
Yeah.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
Do you want to put it in there?

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
It's all right, I can manage it.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
OK.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.600
Come on, fellas.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.600
Just even a little one.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.600
Big saustern, isn't it?

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Yeah.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.600
Back in camp, Lauren and Becky are getting ready to hunt.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
They're prepared, just in case.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.600
We have no water to drink.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.600
We're going to have to go, aren't we?

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
Yes, boss.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.600
Lauren, Beth and Becky have to leave camp to hunt

23:43.600 --> 23:45.600
with nothing to drink.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.600
Trying to look for food in around here

23:49.600 --> 23:52.600
is like trying to look for a needle in a haystack.

23:52.600 --> 23:56.600
I definitely feel like Beyoncé in the Survivor video now.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
It's not as glamorous.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.600
Bit humid in here, isn't it?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
Hot, no water either.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
Not the best idea.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.600
Without water, the heat is beating them,

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
and the hunting party have no choice

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
but to return to camp empty-handed.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.600
Oh, my God, that sun is hot.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
It is hot.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
Come on, fishies.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.600
On the rocks, Julie and Georgina have now been fishing

24:24.600 --> 24:27.600
for four hours in 30-degree heat.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.600
Oh, here's a boxfish.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
Bugger off.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
Look at that.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.600
Don't you go any further forward on that wall.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.600
Shit.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
Oh, dear. My head just went, then.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
Just sit down.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
Oh, dear me.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.600
I nearly hit the deck then, Julie.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.600
Everything went white.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
Oh, fucking hell.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
Do you mind if we make our way back?

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
I just feel a bit rough.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
I think the two of us have got sunstroke.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.600
With their water intake now down to just one litre a day,

24:56.600 --> 24:58.600
the women don't know it,

24:58.600 --> 25:01.600
but they are chronically dehydrated.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.600
If they don't start upping their fluid intake immediately,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
their kidneys will struggle to cope,

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
toxins build up in your body,

25:08.600 --> 25:11.600
and I reckon within days, their internal organs will shut down.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.600
And I'm not being dramatic about this.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
They're in a lot of trouble.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
They're in a lot of trouble right now.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.600
Oh, my God.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.600
We've been out in the sun too long.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.600
How are you doing, Jules?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
It's a good source of love.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.600
Every time we moved, like, to sit up, stand up or sit down,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
you know, we'd go all, ooh.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.600
You know what I mean?

25:37.600 --> 25:40.600
I feel like we've been stupid to sit out in the sun in that heat

25:40.600 --> 25:43.600
with no water in the middle of the day.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.600
It's so frustrating.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.600
It's so frustrating because we could see all the fish there

25:47.600 --> 25:49.600
and we desperately wanted to...

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
I'm coming with you next time, Brie.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
..catch them back.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.600
I'm too tired to even speak.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
I hate being like this.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
It's horrible.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.600
Not having the energy to do anything.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.600
Yesterday, Julie and Georgina went fishing without enough water

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
and collapsed from dehydration.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.600
I can't stand this lack of strength in myself

26:27.600 --> 26:29.600
and lack of energy

26:29.600 --> 26:32.600
and inability to keep going all day

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
because my body just won't let me.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.600
Since discarding a contaminated jerrycan

26:37.600 --> 26:39.600
and halving their water production,

26:39.600 --> 26:41.600
it's slowly dawning on the water.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.600
They've told the women that they're facing chronic dehydration.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.600
There's just not enough water for everyone at the moment.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.600
We've all got pretty much empty bottles at the moment,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
so I now need to wait for this to get boiled,

26:52.600 --> 26:54.600
which is going to take a long time.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.600
Oh, fuck!

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
Oh!

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
What's up?

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
Water's just tipped over.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
Oh, for fuck's sake!

27:04.600 --> 27:08.600
Now, we've got one shitty jerrycan and it falls predictably.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
I knew it was going to fucking fall,

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
but by the time she's picked it up,

27:12.600 --> 27:15.600
all the water's fallen out.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
I'm not drinking it off.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.600
Nobody is.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.600
I am feeling weak right now.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.600
Are you?

27:25.600 --> 27:27.600
I can't get up the sand.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.600
It's like an effort to walk.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
And it's so tiring.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
I don't know about you, Georgie, but I keep going light-headed.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
Do you?

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
Yeah, every time I bend over.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
It's terrible.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
That seems really strange,

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
but every time I sort of bend down to do something

27:42.600 --> 27:46.600
and then get back up, I get really dizzy.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.600
I think everyone's feeling the same, aren't they?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
I am really, really concerned about each of us

27:53.600 --> 27:55.600
because we're not drinking enough.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.600
I mean, some people are drinking less than a litre a day.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.600
I think it's just got worse and worse and worse.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.600
Each of us is feeling like we're going to faint

28:03.600 --> 28:06.600
at several points during the day.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
Having spotted the tell-tale signs

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
of serious dehydration,

28:09.600 --> 28:12.600
Dr Belinda calls an emergency meeting.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
The biggest killer out here,

28:14.600 --> 28:17.600
our biggest, highest risk is dehydration.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.600
We should be getting two litres to four litres a day.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.600
If everyone has one small bottle when you wake up,

28:24.600 --> 28:27.600
then at least you're a quarter of the way there already.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.600
Look, we are in scary territory

28:29.600 --> 28:32.600
where we just don't know what's happening to our bodies

28:32.600 --> 28:36.600
and there could be an effect on our vital organs as well.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
Your kidneys,

28:37.600 --> 28:40.600
and also your central nervous system.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.600
So if you experience any weird symptoms at all, do tell me.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.600
On that note, I just need a sample of your urine.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.600
It's going to give me a general idea of any alarming kidney problems.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
Hi, Belinda.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
Yay, thank you.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.600
Belinda will send the samples

28:59.600 --> 29:02.600
to my support medical team on a nearby island.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.600
So if any of us are in extreme danger, then what happens?

29:06.600 --> 29:09.600
You'd be evacuated off.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
If there's any indication of serious damage to your kidneys,

29:12.600 --> 29:15.600
then we would need to look into that immediately.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.600
And is it possible for some of us to be in this state

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
without knowing about it?

29:20.600 --> 29:24.600
Yeah, because a lot of the symptoms mimic problems that we actually have.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.600
Tiredness is a big thing with kidney failure.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
Nausea as well.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.600
We could well be in this serious situation, be unaware of it.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.600
And it was quite alarming what she had to say, really,

29:39.600 --> 29:43.600
about the way that our bodies can start to fail.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.600
I suppose I should have paid more attention

29:45.600 --> 29:47.600
to what was going to happen to my body.

29:47.600 --> 29:51.600
I was surprised that I was potentially at such risk.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.600
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
Oh, my God!

29:58.600 --> 30:01.600
Whose is that short one? Georgina.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.600
It's like Guinness.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.600
To investigate their health further,

30:09.600 --> 30:11.600
Dr Belinda also weighs the women.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.600
115.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.600
I don't know what you were before.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.600
I think I was 120.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.600
We're quite fragile in a sense,

30:21.600 --> 30:27.600
and the fact is that the things that are kind of deteriorating in my body

30:27.600 --> 30:29.600
are my gums and my tits.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.600
If that continues, then I will probably end up being skeletal

30:33.600 --> 30:35.600
within about two or three weeks.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
And just kind of give up and just be like,

30:38.600 --> 30:40.600
do you know what, let the fucking vultures peck at me.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.600
I was one too far.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Oh, so you've lost a lot, haven't you?

30:44.600 --> 30:47.600
You are 116.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.600
I can't have lost nine pounds.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
You do look really, really thin.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.600
I expected to lose a few pounds each week.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.600
You're not fucking nine pounds.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.600
Bit of a fucking hike, isn't it?

31:06.600 --> 31:09.600
At that rate, I'm not...

31:09.600 --> 31:12.600
You're going to be fucking carrying me off on a stretcher.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
You know what I mean?

31:14.600 --> 31:16.600
I'm so fucking tired.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
You're tired cos you never bloody stop.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
Well, that's...

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
You're like a bloody Duracell bunny, Julie.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
I'm not.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
You are.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
Really not.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
You are.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
The women may feel at rock bottom,

31:28.600 --> 31:32.600
but an instinct to stay alive really is deep within us all.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.600
You know, our subconscious wants us to survive and to thrive.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.600
Let's have a little scavenge

31:37.600 --> 31:39.600
and see what we can find in this shit heap.

31:39.600 --> 31:43.600
The group make a last-ditch attempt to produce more drinking water.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
Having discarded one of the jerrycans,

31:45.600 --> 31:49.600
Fi, Julie and the others forage for a second suitable container

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
to boil water.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
What's that there?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
Basically just a load of shit.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
Nothing very useful, I don't think.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
Metal is something that really is important.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.600
I haven't seen any.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
It's all plastic.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.600
It's all plastic.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.600
It's all plastic.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.600
I mean, it's all plastic, and you can't obviously boil it.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.600
I am certain it's plastic.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.600
If we don't get the things we need, we won't survive.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
It's as simple as that.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
Plastic bottles.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.600
Plastic cans.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.600
Basically, plastic.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.600
And that's it.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.600
Oh, we don't want that!

32:25.600 --> 32:28.600
They've failed to find any metal containers,

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
but Julie is not giving up.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
We have to find something.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.600
Desperately dehydrated, she hunts further afield

32:36.600 --> 32:38.600
to find a second container.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
We'll be tired.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.600
We'll be high again in a minute.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
Julie!

32:43.600 --> 32:45.600
Julie!

32:46.600 --> 32:48.600
You all right?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.600
Julie!

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
Jesus.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
Julie!

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
Julie!

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Fucking hell, Jules.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
Come on.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
It's day 35,

33:03.600 --> 33:07.600
and 55-year-old Julie has collapsed from dehydration.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.600
I'm just so weak.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
I'm so weak.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
Get Bea and get on the blower.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
No.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
Jules, just no.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
Don't ring anyone.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.600
I'll get up now.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
No, you won't. No, you won't. Just no.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.600
Bea, Julie's passed out.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
Stay there, Jules. Stay there.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
Go ahead. Fox Rock.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
We've got a situation here in that Jules

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
has passed out.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.600
With Dr Belinda away from camp collecting water

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
and out of reach,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.600
my emergency medical team on a nearby island

33:39.600 --> 33:41.600
is immediately scrambled.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
How are you feeling?

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
I think it was just...

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
It's all right. Just precautionary, OK?

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
What do you want to do, Julie?

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
How do you feel about trying to sit up for me?

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
How does it feel?

33:55.600 --> 33:57.600
Just hold your pulse while you're sat up there.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Yeah.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
Without drinking coffee.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
Without drinking at all.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.600
Without drinking today.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
I haven't had a lot today, to be honest.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
Nice.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.600
You need to be constantly hydrated

34:08.600 --> 34:11.600
to do the smallest tasks here.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
And it really does go to show

34:13.600 --> 34:16.600
that just in one little moment here,

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
it can all change.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.600
I'm happy you're bright enough. Everything's fine.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
Honestly, girl, please.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.600
I'm so nervous.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.600
Right.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
She's dehydrated.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.600
You're all dehydrated.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.600
If you can just keep an eye on her.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.600
You put a whole load of fit soldier on iron like this

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
for weeks and weeks,

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
and they'd struggle with it as well.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
No, definitely not a game.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.600
Oh, you're awful good to me.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.600
I don't think I'm a drama queen,

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
but I think...

34:50.600 --> 34:54.600
..I could have just closed my eyes and drifted off.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.600
I'm not cool like that.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.600
Even the strongest women are slowly dying of thirst.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.600
I might need to lie down again.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.600
For nearly five weeks,

35:16.600 --> 35:19.600
the group has been subsisting on barely any food,

35:19.600 --> 35:21.600
and they remain down one jerry can,

35:21.600 --> 35:24.600
producing half the water they need to survive.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
Basically, I think I...

35:26.600 --> 35:29.600
..either almost fainted

35:29.600 --> 35:31.600
or very briefly...

35:31.600 --> 35:34.600
..very briefly lost consciousness.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.600
The signs of chronic dehydration

35:39.600 --> 35:42.600
really are now starting to show amongst women.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
And to give you an idea,

35:43.600 --> 35:46.600
just losing just 5% of your body weight in water

35:46.600 --> 35:49.600
leads to irritability, headaches, lightheadedness.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.600
When you get to 8%, the lack of water causes fainting fits.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
After that, delirium.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.600
Delirium, an hallucination set in.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.600
And when you get to 15% to 20% of your body weight lost,

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
you're dead.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.600
It's literally just our minds now getting us through it.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.600
It's literally just people being like,

36:09.600 --> 36:11.600
I am going to finish this, I am going to finish this,

36:11.600 --> 36:14.600
that is keeping us going, like you did yesterday.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
No, it isn't. I'm not going home.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
I'm not going home. Exactly.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
The group's on their arse at the minute, Georgia.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
The group is completely on their arse.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.600
The results of everyone's work

36:24.600 --> 36:28.600
and the results of everyone's emergency urine tests are back.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.600
Foxtrot, Foxtrot, this is...

36:31.600 --> 36:36.600
All 10 altogether can hear you loud and clear. Over.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.600
Paramedic Mike and survival expert Ross,

36:39.600 --> 36:42.600
my rapid response unit on a nearby island,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
have urgently asked to speak to the whole camp.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.600
I'm looking at your urine results and things.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.600
Yeah, and I'm looking at your weight charts and everything.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.600
And I'm looking at people whose kidney function

36:53.600 --> 36:55.600
is on a decline.

36:55.600 --> 37:00.600
And I cannot stand by and let that decline continue.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.600
Based on the fact that what I'm looking at

37:03.600 --> 37:05.600
and what I saw the other day...

37:05.600 --> 37:07.600
..and your dietary input,

37:07.600 --> 37:11.600
it's not enough to keep you going

37:11.600 --> 37:14.600
without causing you all, or certainly...

37:14.600 --> 37:17.600
..a number of you, some long-term problems.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.600
Your bodies are just starting to fail at this point.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.600
Now, there's no easy way to say this.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
I'm teetering right on the brink

37:26.600 --> 37:30.600
of pulling you all off the island for medical reasons. Over.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
Bloody hell.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.600
Yeah, I think everyone really understands. Over.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.600
The solution is use the other jerry can.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
I can't say it any other way.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.600
You need to be drinking, at a minimum,

37:50.600 --> 37:53.600
three litres of water per day.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.600
Worst-case scenario, when you're all sitting in a hospital,

37:56.600 --> 38:00.600
the thought of drinking out of a slightly disgusting jerry can

38:00.600 --> 38:03.600
that's had pigs in it will not seem as bad

38:03.600 --> 38:06.600
as potentially a lifetime on dialysis.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
Copy that.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.600
If you do not get control...

38:14.600 --> 38:16.600
..in 36 hours' time, you're out.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.600
In 36 hours' time, you're coming off the island. Over.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.600
There you go.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.600
The women have just 36 hours to pull back from the brink.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.600
They're not fucking about.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.600
We are going to be pulled off this island.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
I mean, very fucking seriously.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.600
I know that we all need water, full stop,

38:37.600 --> 38:40.600
and that's the only thing that's going to stop our kidneys failing.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.600
Secondarily, let's get some regular food into us.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.600
That's going to help with our general energy levels.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.600
For us to get to the end of this,

38:47.600 --> 38:50.600
it's about keeping our energy levels up

38:50.600 --> 38:52.600
and hydration levels up

38:52.600 --> 38:55.600
so that we actually survive for the next couple of days

38:55.600 --> 38:57.600
and don't go into renal failure.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.600
And if we don't, then we're going to be taken off

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
and we're all going to look like massive dickheads.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.600
I know some people are struggling more than others,

39:05.600 --> 39:08.600
but what we need to do is, you know,

39:08.600 --> 39:13.600
try and work together without causing arguments,

39:13.600 --> 39:14.600
disagreements, arguments.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
Unnecessary stress.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
Everyone's knackered, everyone is tired,

39:18.600 --> 39:21.600
everyone has no energy, hasn't eaten food,

39:21.600 --> 39:24.600
we're all in the same boat, but we all need to come together.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.600
Exactly. We have to get through it.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
We have to pull together.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.600
And in a way, it's going to force us to do that.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.600
At times, we work as individuals and not really work as a team,

39:35.600 --> 39:38.600
but we're going to have to. We have to work together now.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.600
When a group faces a life-threatening crisis,

39:43.600 --> 39:46.600
do you lie down and die, or do you pick yourself up

39:46.600 --> 39:49.600
and determine that you're going to control your destiny?

39:49.600 --> 39:52.600
You're going to go out there, you're going to be resourceful,

39:52.600 --> 39:55.600
you're going to work hard, and you're going to turn the situation around.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.600
If these women have any hope of surviving, it means teamwork,

39:59.600 --> 40:02.600
and that takes courage and hard graft.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.600
I've got to cross that swamp. Yeah.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.600
With everyone agreed they need the crucial second jerrycan,

40:11.600 --> 40:13.600
Fi has volunteered to return.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.600
They retrieve and sanitise it,

40:15.600 --> 40:18.600
so the women can immediately double their water intake.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.600
That can is going to be full of all sorts of shit and bugs.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.600
I'm not really breathing very deeply.

40:24.600 --> 40:29.600
Rank with putrid pork, it's been sweltering in the swamp for ten days.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.600
Oh, nice. Splashed on my foot.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.600
But sometimes the island can be unexpectedly generous.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
Not that smelly, is it?

40:38.600 --> 40:40.600
Absolutely amazing.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.600
It doesn't smell rank on any level.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.600
Maybe the maggots have done the job.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.600
There's a lot to be said for maggots.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.600
I'm so glad we got that jerrycan back, actually.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.600
Now the two-jerrycan system is back up and running,

40:55.600 --> 40:58.600
the women should at last be able to hit the daily target

40:58.600 --> 41:00.600
of three litres of water each.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.600
So, we've got one can on the boil.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.600
And I just want to get this one filtered.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.600
I'm less stressed now about the water.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
Just drink that anyway, shut up.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.600
Get it down you.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.600
I'll just squeeze a wee out.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.600
Thank God.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.600
But I don't want to...

41:18.600 --> 41:20.600
I'm not leaving.

41:21.600 --> 41:25.600
We've been walking too long before we find some yucca.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.600
With the water production line back on a roll,

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
Jamie is happy to return to work,

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
joining forces with Lauren and Beth

41:32.600 --> 41:34.600
to find some fresh water to drink.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.600
It's been a long journey.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.600
She's joined forces with Lauren and Beth

41:38.600 --> 41:41.600
to find carbohydrates the group urgently needs.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
God, I can barely walk.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.600
It's really hard.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.600
It's hard, you know, being in a group

41:47.600 --> 41:49.600
and put under so much stress.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.600
And nobody's perfect.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.600
Everybody has their moments.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.600
But we have to stick together as a team.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.600
Our muscles are stronger.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.600
I can see some yucca.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.600
What have you got there?

42:02.600 --> 42:03.600
Woo!

42:03.600 --> 42:05.600
Boom!

42:05.600 --> 42:06.600
Woo-hoo!

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
Oh!

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
Woo-hoo!

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

42:09.600 --> 42:11.600
Yeeees!

42:11.600 --> 42:12.600
Woo-hoo!

42:12.600 --> 42:14.600
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

42:14.600 --> 42:17.600
Yeah, we're cooking on gas now, girls.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.600
Look, once you see one, you see them all.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
Oh, my.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
A lot.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.600
Small but perfectly formed.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
Uh-oh.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.600
Lauren has always.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.600
The girls got yucca.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
Yeah, we got yucca.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
Woo!

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
That's amazing, Lauren.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
Yeah, Lauren!

42:40.600 --> 42:42.600
Yes, not just me.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.600
High-five!

42:44.600 --> 42:46.600
Yay!

42:46.600 --> 42:49.600
Check out my yucca.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.600
Do you like a piece of my yucca?

42:51.600 --> 42:53.600
In and around all night.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
Please, you're right on the edge. It's freaking me out.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.600
It's all right, love.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.600
A rehydrated Julie is with Georgie and Beth,

43:04.600 --> 43:08.600
determined to finally land that elusive fish for supper.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.600
OK, another little fishy.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.600
And they've come up with a new way to attract fish,

43:13.600 --> 43:15.600
a sparkling lure.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.600
And that is a state-of-the-art bit of fishing kit there.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.600
Fishing tackle. Right.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.600
Coca-Cola, give us some luck.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.600
If I get pulled in, I'm going to swim round that way.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.600
You won't.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.600
I'm so cack-handed at everything.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.600
Ooh!

43:33.600 --> 43:34.600
I can see, like...

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
Ooh!

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
Ooh!

43:37.600 --> 43:38.600
As hard as you can.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.600
Oh!

43:41.600 --> 43:44.600
Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

43:44.600 --> 43:47.600
Caught a fish! Is it alive?

43:47.600 --> 43:50.600
Well done, Julie!

43:50.600 --> 43:53.600
Oh, my God! I thought you were going to...

43:53.600 --> 43:55.600
Sucker!

43:55.600 --> 43:57.600
Dinner!

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
Basically, whatever it takes to stay.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.600
Whatever it takes.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
Go on, Georgie.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.600
Go on, Jules.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
We'll trade that fisherman to give us some fish.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.600
Hola!

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
Hola!

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
He's coming.

44:13.600 --> 44:18.600
Not content with just one small fish, Julie spots another opportunity,

44:18.600 --> 44:22.600
the first passing boat the women have seen in these waters.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.600
I don't know, Jules, it's your turn to get the backs out.

44:25.600 --> 44:29.600
He's not going to want to see a 55-year-old's backs.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.600
I don't know, mate, your backs are way better than mine.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.600
You have fish?

44:34.600 --> 44:35.600
You have fish?

44:35.600 --> 44:37.600
One fish?

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
Fish!

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
We have none.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.600
We have none. No fish.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.600
He's going to throw it!

44:42.600 --> 44:45.600
Oh, you're very, very kind.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.600
Whoa!

44:48.600 --> 44:49.600
Thank you very much.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.600
Thank you.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
Bless you. Bless you.

44:52.600 --> 44:55.600
Good luck.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.600
Gracias, amigo!

44:58.600 --> 44:59.600
Now, I think that is...

44:59.600 --> 45:00.600
Ah!

45:00.600 --> 45:02.600
I think that is a...

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
Barracuda.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.600
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.600
Ah!

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
I could just go, ah!

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
And bite it and eat it raw.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.600
I'm so hungry.

45:11.600 --> 45:16.600
I don't know whether that was actually playing by Queensberry rules,

45:16.600 --> 45:19.600
but innovation, innovation, innovation.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.600
Whoo!

45:21.600 --> 45:23.600
We caught a fish!

45:23.600 --> 45:24.600
Yeah!

45:24.600 --> 45:26.600
Oh, my God, it's massive!

45:26.600 --> 45:28.600
Whoo!

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
This is a Barracuda.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
Barracuda.

45:30.600 --> 45:31.600
Barracuda.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.600
Barracuda.

45:32.600 --> 45:33.600
Barracuda.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.600
Barracuda.

45:34.600 --> 45:35.600
Barracuda.

45:35.600 --> 45:36.600
Yeah!

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
Barracuda.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.600
Oh, my God, you guys are incredible.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.600
Incredible, I love it.

45:44.600 --> 45:47.600
Smells amazing.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.600
We should have got this place licked.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.600
You know, ten women, hey,

45:50.600 --> 45:53.600
this place should have been ship-shaped.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.600
Tragically, not the case.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.600
There's the hero of the moment.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.600
I don't even want to talk.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.840
I don't even want a twirl. It's still tasty.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.400
But at least we've started now.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.280
Not too late.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.160
Next time on The Men's Island.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.360
It's little old me.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.960
Unfortunately, I don't trust you.

46:18.600 --> 46:19.440
Whoa!

46:19.440 --> 46:21.000
There's a death trap round here.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.120
Snake!

46:22.120 --> 46:22.960
Okay.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.400
We have no food.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.240
Stop it!

46:25.240 --> 46:26.240
Holy shit!

46:55.240 --> 47:00.200
THE MEN'S ISLAND
