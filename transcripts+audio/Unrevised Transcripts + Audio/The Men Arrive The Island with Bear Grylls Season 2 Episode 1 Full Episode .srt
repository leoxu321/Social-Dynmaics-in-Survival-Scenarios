1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,700
two uninhabited Pacific Islands more than 5,000 miles from the UK one will be inhabited by 14

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:24,180
British men while a separate island will be home to 14 British women when pushed to the limits of

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,520
human endurance will it be brute power or mental strength the winds a day who will have what it

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:45,600
takes to stay alive tonight we follow the men Britain today we've never been further from a

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,820
hunter-gatherer origins but I want to know when stripped of everything

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,360
has modern man still got that instinct to survive

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,600
to find out a marooning 14 ordinary men on a desert island this is crazy this is absolutely

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,060
crazy this could be the worst decision we've ever made this time it'll be harder than ever

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
they'll have to endure six weeks in the height of the harsh tropical storm season

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,640
this is the worst you can do

11
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,540
they'll be utterly alone filming everything themselves we have two choices one we go down

12
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,600
the 40-foot Ravine holy well we keep going through this of a jungle they'll have to find their own

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:49,260
water and hunt for their own food we've just got a prehistoric animal you lazy bunch of bone idle

14
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,820
bastards have these modern day men got what it takes to survive

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:03,540
that's the hardest thing I've done

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,120
I personally don't think men are as strong now as they were I wouldn't even say 50 years ago even

17
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,300
five years ago because we have it too easy the interesting question to ask actually is if we

18
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,880
lost everything what would happen to us it'd be nice to think I've come off the island feeling

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,880
a little bit more macho a little bit more alpha male a little bit more popular with the ladies

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm about to abandon these men on a remote Pacific island to see if they can survive

21
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,820
they will be utterly alone my oldest was 19.

22
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,900
he only needs me for money in a lift and the youngest one's too cool to hang around with

23
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,060
dad my dream is for them guys to go that's my dad that that's fantastic my dad did that

24
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,360
I don't think I've done anything that's put myself at risk really but I'm scared he's

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,840
taking a graphic designer on an island with no other skills whatsoever anything could happen

26
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,680
these 14 ordinary men do not know each other and they have no experience in living in the wild

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,640
at the moment I don't enjoy day-to-day life

28
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,560
I've got a stressful job I've got a newborn baby at home I want to go on the island to

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,260
get away from the day-to-day I think everyone in life does take certain things for

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,460
granted electricity when you turn on the light having a warm shower having breakfast when it's

31
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,140
not there and you wake up in the morning and go where's the next meal coming from it's a man test

32
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,660
isn't it okay guys we're getting closer you are very remote here the next stop that way is New Zealand

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,900
out is has all of this cushioning that civilization has experienced over the last 50 years made us

34
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,740
totally lose touch with that survival instinct that I believe is deep within us all okay guys

35
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,040
I need you to be my eyes for any rocks and loads of rocks it takes an extreme situation to find out

36
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:22,560
what people are really made of what you're about to embark on it will be the toughest thing you will

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,640
do this all right you can do it the men's home for the next six weeks is an uninhabited island

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,900
in a remote Pacific archipelago the 11 kilometers of coastline is dominated by treacherous cliffs and

39
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,700
rocky headlands vicious swells and powerful ocean currents means there's no easy way onto

40
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,580
the island I'm gonna try and get you guys as close as I can all right

41
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,680
but you will end up swimming any of you guys are weak swimmers it is a good time to say I've never

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,480
swam this distance before not even a swimming pool but I will get there I will get there age won't

43
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,320
stop me doing this not often in one's life someone actually challenges your morals challenges you

44
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,900
physically and this does that's why I want to do it who can't swim confidently confident with

45
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,520
unconfident yeah let's go

46
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,680
the men must make the 75 meter swim to the island fully closed

47
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,080
help each other help those who are weaker let's go let's go

48
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,480
strong undercurrents mean the men need to get to shore as quickly as possible

49
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,060
go get out of the water go go go

50
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,400
out of the water go see if they can

51
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,020
wow that was the damnedest thing I ever did

52
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,680
I couldn't have gone much further but that's only a taste of what we've got to come then bring it children yeah well the advice is

53
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
take your own piss which is a bit unnerving with only two days survival training initiative will be key

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,980
essentially it's water isn't it is that your favorite��요

55
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
You've got to save your piss, mate. You've got to save your piss.

56
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Yeah, yeah. Save your piss.

57
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Drink your own piss!

58
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,180
I hope not.

59
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,180
So, they look a bit like a party of drowned rats at the moment.

60
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Kind of let the chaos begin.

61
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,180
But what I do know is, when I return in six weeks' time,

62
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,180
the 14 men, if there are still 14 men there,

63
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,180
which, to be honest, I doubt,

64
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
the men that do remain...

65
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,180
..will be changed.

66
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,180
It's time for me and the crew to leave.

67
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,180
We won't be back until the end of the experiment.

68
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
For the next six weeks,

69
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,180
the men will have to live entirely on their own wits.

70
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,180
To make sure these men at least have a fighting chance at survival,

71
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
I've ensured the island's got enough water,

72
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,180
indigenous animals and vegetation on it to keep them alive.

73
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
It's teeming with wildlife.

74
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,180
But what they've got to have is the ingenuity

75
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
to find it,

76
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
catch it and kill it.

77
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
What's your name, mate?

78
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Paul.

79
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
I'm Ross.

80
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Hello, Ross.

81
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
From here on in,

82
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,180
everything you see will be filmed by the men themselves.

83
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Why don't we get everybody together

84
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,180
and then we'll work out something that we're going to do

85
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,180
and then we're all going to be heading that way,

86
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm assuming, anyway,

87
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,180
because it looks a little bit safer than this,

88
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
cos it'll be dark soon.

89
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Come on, lads, let's make use of some of this energy while we've got it.

90
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,180
All of the men will film,

91
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,180
but four of the group are trained and experienced camera operators.

92
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm Ross.

93
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Sam.

94
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
How you doing, mate?

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Who'll be living under exactly the same conditions as everyone else.

96
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Oh, I'm like a fucking mule arse, aren't I?

97
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
The brains of a donkey!

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Obviously, because we are having to film everything ourselves,

99
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,180
we've got to cart all of the camera gear, batteries and everything with us.

100
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Let's do it.

101
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
Let's get on with it.

102
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,180
For fuck's sake, this is survival, not Good Morning Britain.

103
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,180
As well as the camera equipment, they'll have a medical kit,

104
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,180
two jerry cans containing a day's supply of water,

105
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,180
basic fishing equipment and a handful of tools.

106
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,180
Guys, how many knives do we have? Let's count them in.

107
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Three knives, three machetes.

108
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Three knives, that's easy.

109
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,180
So, I'll gather round in one group, guys.

110
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm Barney and I'm a paramedic from Leicester.

111
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
I'm Andy Bennett, builder for Milton Keynes.

112
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
We've got a fucking builder, everybody!

113
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,180
Let's hope he's not a cowboy.

114
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,180
My name's Piers, I am a doctor.

115
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,180
I'm Kyle and I'm a website consultant.

116
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,180
My name's Paul, I invented the dice.

117
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I'm a construction contract manager.

118
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,180
It's 4pm. With only two hours of daylight remaining,

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,180
the men's priority has to be finding a safe place to shelter for the night.

120
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,180
If they can't, they'll have to sleep rough on the jungle floor,

121
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,180
alongside potentially deadly scorpions, snakes and caiman crocodiles.

122
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,180
We're assuming that the north side of the island

123
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,180
would be nice beachy, sandy, flat seas.

124
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Paul thinks the group's best option is a beach.

125
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Let's go.

126
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
And he's convinced they have time to cross the island

127
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
to find one before dark.

128
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Who else was imagining sunny beaches

129
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,180
when they thought about coming out here?

130
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
These trees here are very sharp.

131
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,180
There you go.

132
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,180
I believe it will now be referred to as the porcupine tree.

133
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Vicious.

134
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,180
The interior of the island is three square kilometres

135
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,180
of mangrove swamp and unbroken jungle.

136
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
And I know from experience

137
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,180
that moving through dense island undergrowth

138
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
is a slow, exhausting work.

139
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,180
It will do all you can to stop you in your tracks.

140
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,180
And often, the harder you push, the harder it pushes back.

141
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Whoa! Stop!

142
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
There's a snake down here.

143
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,180
It's a boa, isn't it?

144
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
Take its head off if it's a decent size, mate.

145
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
Get stuck in.

146
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,180
Is anyone going to help me?

147
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm trying to carry a bag and a machete and kill a snake.

148
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,180
He's looking pretty aggressive. He's coiling, isn't he?

149
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
I need a long stick just to put on its head.

150
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Mind you, no snake.

151
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Mind you...

152
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,180
No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that, for fuck's sake.

153
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Listen, should we just throw this case on it?

154
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
No.

155
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Part of me thinks, should we just leave it?

156
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Didn't even flinch, did it?

157
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Yeah, yeah, let's keep going.

158
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
If we don't get out of this shrub,

159
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,180
we're going to be sleeping here tonight.

160
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
It ain't safe and it's not cool.

161
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,180
With just an hour to go until nightfall,

162
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
the men have covered barely 400 metres.

163
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Paul!

164
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Yes?

165
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
You going to come and get a drink?

166
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
The darker it's getting,

167
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
the more it's getting a little bit worrying.

168
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Tap on it when you're done.

169
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Somehow I've fallen into chief navigator mode,

170
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,180
but I'm on it.

171
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
My days are very stressful.

172
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,180
It really doesn't fucking matter.

173
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
I don't give a fuck.

174
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
A lot of the time I think that most people are fucking idiots.

175
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Just get that load out, get that load out.

176
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,180
You can't build the internal walls anyway.

177
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Being called a bastard is just a friendly greeting

178
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
in the building industry.

179
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Get in there and get it done.

180
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,180
This experience might change me.

181
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Hopefully for the better.

182
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,180
It might make me be a little bit more tolerant of other people.

183
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Come on, fuckers.

184
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
This is going to take us fucking hours.

185
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Yeah, it's about to get darker and darker as well.

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Yeah, I know, so that's why we've just got to get through it.

187
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
We need to start to think,

188
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
do we want to be hacking through this stuff

189
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
when it's pitch black,

190
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
or the next time we see a clearing,

191
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
are we going to think about settling down for the night?

192
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,180
Mate, I personally want to just plough on and make it.

193
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
I mean, it's going to get darker in here

194
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,180
quicker than it is on the beach.

195
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,180
I say we plough on.

196
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy.

197
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
I don't know what to say right now.

198
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,180
I never had the money to go travelling.

199
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,180
I've never done anything that's been a bit sort of edgy,

200
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,180
that's been a bit...

201
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
..dangerous, I guess.

202
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
I don't think I'm as confident as I was

203
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
as I say I am,

204
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,180
and I think a lot of what I do can be a front.

205
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,180
The sort of persona of alpha male to me

206
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
is everything my stepdad was.

207
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,180
I saw enough of him growing up to realise who not to be.

208
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,180
I guess it's time to find out who I really am.

209
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Keep coming! We're only 100 metres away!

210
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,180
It keeps saying it's like the beach is 100 metres away.

211
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,180
It's all getting a little bit pissed off

212
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180
because we've been walking for about fucking miles

213
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
and it's not here.

214
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
The temperatures are freeing.

215
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,180
It's like 51-year-old builder Andy is struggling to keep up.

216
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
At the moment, it's like every man for himself.

217
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
For fuck's sake.

218
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
First.

219
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Cut.

220
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,180
We've not even made any ground

221
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,180
and we are all...fucked.

222
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,180
Joe, pop Randy and help you.

223
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,180
He's got a really awkward box on his arm.

224
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
I know it's a ball-legged kid,

225
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,180
but you're carrying one of the fucking easiest things in the world.

226
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
I'm a fuck.

227
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
I know it's heavy.

228
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
I'm a fuck, pal. No, I'm not.

229
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
But it's easy.

230
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
You want to carry this bag?

231
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
It's fucked.

232
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
I'll swap you now, mate, if you want.

233
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,180
At the front, Paul pushes on, despite the group's growing descent.

234
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,180
Have we got lights in those cameras, Sam?

235
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Bit of infrared.

236
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
How you doing, mate?

237
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
Some people ain't playing ball.

238
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
In what way? What do you mean?

239
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Oh.

240
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Cracking on with fuck all, you know?

241
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
We could all do that, like a hero with a machete.

242
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Come on.

243
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
For fuck's sake.

244
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
I know we all want to get on, but...

245
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,180
you've got to think of everybody else now. We're a team.

246
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
You can't just be selfish, you know?

247
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
Oh, there's a bit of light, look.

248
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
This is amazing.

249
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
I've found the sea.

250
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Ah.

251
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Ah.

252
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

253
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Oh.

254
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Yeah, it's a good beach.

255
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Come on.

256
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Hooray, boys.

257
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Come on.

258
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Booyah.

259
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Beach.

260
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Ha, ha.

261
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
Pina coladas.

262
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

263
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
It's the hardest thing I've ever done.

264
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Come on.

265
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Come on.

266
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Fuck.

267
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I never thought I'd be so happy to see the beach in my entire life.

268
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Well done, mate. Well done.

269
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Fuck.

270
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Nice one, mate.

271
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Oh.

272
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
I never doubted myself.

273
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Never underestimate your own abilities.

274
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,180
The sun's just beginning to set, so we're just in time.

275
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,180
And everyone is on such a high right now.

276
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
That's a whale.

277
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
It's a whale.

278
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
Wow.

279
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

280
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,180
We're still there watching the sunset, and there's whales swimming past us.

281
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Pretty cool.

282
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
You don't get that often, do you?

283
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
You're right.

284
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
About two minutes sleep, I think.

285
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,180
One time, huh?

286
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,180
16 hours ago, I dropped 14 ordinary British men on a remote desert island.

287
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,180
I haven't slept for a minute.

288
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Not a minute.

289
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,180
They have spent their first night on the beach with no shelter.

290
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Is that really shit?

291
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Oh, what have we done?

292
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

293
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
You never get that realization.

294
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,180
You've done something you didn't quite think all the way through.

295
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
At one point, I was shitting if we were going to get washed away.

296
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,180
I was like, did it get that close?

297
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
I mean, you can see the line, mate.

298
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
You can see the line.

299
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
The line's, what, three foot away from where we were?

300
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,180
Look at the amount of rubbish on this beach.

301
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Has anyone found a left shoe?

302
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Yeah, but these, I'm not too sure if I'm going to go for these.

303
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,180
What are you?

304
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
A bit last season.

305
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Hey, lads.

306
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
Look.

307
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Found a pink pair.

308
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,180
These are bloody comfortable.

309
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Look at these bad boys.

310
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,180
This is the male version.

311
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,180
The men came onto the island with just a day's supply of drinking water.

312
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Mouthfuls.

313
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:32,180
But after yesterday's arduous trek in 34-degree heat, it's all but gone.

314
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Tropical storm season.

315
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Really, there shouldn't be any shortage of water.

316
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,180
And obviously, rain itself is drinkable without purification.

317
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,180
But once it hits the ground, it becomes contaminated.

318
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
All sorts of bacterias and nasties there.

319
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:49,180
From experience, I can tell you, animals aren't fussy about where they crap.

320
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Oh, my God.

321
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Look at all the crap that's in there.

322
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
That's fucking horrible.

323
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Without boiling, this rancid water would almost certainly give the men stomach cramps and diarrhoea.

324
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
It's not salty, but...

325
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
I'll tell you what.

326
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I've had hangover shits that smell better than that.

327
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
Guys, can we...

328
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,180
Why don't we all kind of gather in and have some sort of conflab about what we're going to do today?

329
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah, I think that might be a very good idea, please.

330
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Go on, guys.

331
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Gather round.

332
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
You want a plan of action, lads?

333
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Yeah.

334
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,180
We 100% need to try and make a fire now.

335
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:30,180
If we don't make a fire and something to boil new water, we are going to be in bad shape by tomorrow morning.

336
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Food is becoming a priority very quickly.

337
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,180
For a lot of people, we're going to have to get something substantial to eat fairly soon.

338
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Right.

339
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Meet and adjourn.

340
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Shall we dance, sir?

341
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Is that ready?

342
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Let's go.

343
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
The men decide to split up.

344
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Having eaten nothing since they arrived, the majority of the group head off to look for food,

345
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,180
while engineer Dan and builder Andy take on the fire lighting.

346
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,180
It's quite a lot of pressure to get this fire going.

347
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
You're down?

348
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
I'm up.

349
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Yeah.

350
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
To me?

351
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
To me.

352
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Awesome.

353
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
That is not an ideal start, is it?

354
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,180
That did one stroke.

355
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Oh, lads.

356
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,180
I shot my load.

357
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Round about here, there's about six, maybe ten snails and shit, yeah?

358
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Along the coast, 47-year-old Vic has decided to put Joe, the group's youngest member, to work.

359
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
We should definitely have put some fucking shoes on.

360
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
That might have been a wise idea, fella.

361
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Oh!

362
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Just anything.

363
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
Limpets, crabs, give them a crack.

364
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Snails.

365
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
You spot them, fella, and I'll club them.

366
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Do these snails bite?

367
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,180
I feel as though something with legs is going to come out of there, innit?

368
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
A nippy.

369
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Don't put your finger where you won't put your dick, because it might get bit.

370
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,180
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the nearest we get to Michelin star.

371
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Will we put it on a bed of anything?

372
00:19:53,180 --> 00:20:01,180
One.

373
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,180
A morning's hard graft provides nothing more than a handful of limpets.

374
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Give it a good old cheer.

375
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Fucking hell.

376
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,180
Yeah.

377
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Yeah, it's tough.

378
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Limpets.

379
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Limpets are horrendous.

380
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,180
You don't buy them in supermarkets, do you?

381
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,180
So they're not known for being very nice.

382
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,180
I don't think they're very nice at all.

383
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,180
For now, the men will have to go hungry.

384
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Stop.

385
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Who said there's no smoke without fire?

386
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Lying bastards.

387
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
The fire's pissed me off a little bit.

388
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,180
I just don't know what we're doing wrong.

389
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Lighting a fire has become an urgent priority.

390
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
It's 34 degrees in the shade,

391
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,180
and the men have had little to drink in the past 12 hours.

392
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
We've literally, we've got no water.

393
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
None at all?

394
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
None.

395
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I had a piss 20 minutes ago,

396
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
and it was like pissing lion's golden syrup.

397
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I had to push it out.

398
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
That is not viscous and clear.

399
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
No, it's definitely not.

400
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,180
The men are starting to show the telltale signs of serious dehydration.

401
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Thirsty, really bloody thirsty.

402
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Gone out of me.

403
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
I said, fuck off.

404
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
The vultures are circling already.

405
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,180
Look at the size of that.

406
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Jesus.

407
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
That's prehistoric.

408
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
How about your glasses?

409
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
Do you reckon we can...

410
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Can I try your glasses?

411
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Try it, mate.

412
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Yeah.

413
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
With their need for fire now critical,

414
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
web consultant Kyle,

415
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
has an idea he wants to try.

416
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
We've got Andy's glasses.

417
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,180
Just basically using the sun to focus at one point

418
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
is giving us quite a lot of heat.

419
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
Come on.

420
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Come on.

421
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,180
Hoping that's going to work, the old glasses.

422
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Let go, let go.

423
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Oh, go on, Andy lad.

424
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
Sticks.

425
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Get the little sticks.

426
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Preparation.

427
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Where's the next last stick?

428
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Where's the rest of the shit?

429
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Where's the rest of the stuff?

430
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Sticks.

431
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Fucking sticks.

432
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Get up there.

433
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
Get up there.

434
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Swipe right side.

435
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Swipe right side.

436
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
All right.

437
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Put it off.

438
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Put it off.

439
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Real tight.

440
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Breathe it.

441
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
Go on, Andy.

442
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Go on, son.

443
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Go on, son.

444
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Go on.

445
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Slow.

446
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Slow hard.

447
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Slow hard.

448
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
He'll go.

449
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Come on.

450
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
That's it.

451
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Come on.

452
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
It's nigger there.

453
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Keep going.

454
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Keep going.

455
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
Keep going.

456
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
Keep going.

457
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Sticks.

458
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
Twigs.

459
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,180
You got it.

460
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
The little twigs.

461
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Yeah.

462
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Twigs.

463
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
Yeah, twigs.

464
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Found you.

465
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
Twigs.

466
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Slowly, slowly.

467
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

468
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Yeah.

469
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
There we go.

470
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Bingo.

471
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Well done, you two.

472
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
It was Kyle that started it.

473
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Good.

474
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Of course it was.

475
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
He showed me the way and I followed through.

476
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I see.

477
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
We've done well.

478
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
We got there.

479
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Absolutely brilliant.

480
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Well done.

481
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
What a dark horse.

482
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
Excuse the pun.

483
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
We all take it back about the IT guy.

484
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Fucking yes.

485
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Well done, Kyle.

486
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:28,180
After eight hours of trying, the men finally have a fire on which to boil the stagnant water.

487
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,180
I'm going to drink and drink and drink until my piss falls clear.

488
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
And your verdict is?

489
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
I mean, it's almost like normal water.

490
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
There's a bit of sort of pond in there.

491
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
That is top notch.

492
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,180
It doesn't taste like piss, does it?

493
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,180
It tastes like metal weight tea.

494
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,180
As long as the fire stays lit, the men will have a source of safety.

495
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
They have a source of safe drinking water.

496
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
A little bit of that.

497
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
A little bit of that.

498
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
One achievement there.

499
00:23:53,180 --> 00:24:02,180
But keeping it alight during tropical storm season will be a huge challenge.

500
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
Shit.

501
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Look at that rain.

502
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
So look like right there, tropical paradise.

503
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
And then there.

504
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
Shit hole.

505
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,180
Shit hole.

506
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180
It's like Waitrose and Aldi all in one picture.

507
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
What I'm worried about is that this hot shoe is still wet.

508
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Oh shit.

509
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Right here?

510
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
It's not wet.

511
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
It's just cold.

512
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
But it's not like the weather.

513
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
The temperature is protect us from cold.

514
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,420
What I'm worried about is everyone's off doing other things,

515
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,180
and in a minute, it's going to be pissing down with rain.

516
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,660
I actually think it'd be quite important to build a shelter for the fire.

517
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,340
I've not got the energy to build a shelter or anything at the moment.

518
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,140
If I could, I would, I promise you.

519
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,940
A little bit worried about Andy.

520
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,100
He seems to have separated himself from the group a little bit.

521
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,940
When everybody's together, he walks off.

522
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,740
He's now making a bed over there, which just seems a bit childish.

523
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,580
Feels like he doesn't want to be part of the group.

524
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,100
Hey, hey, I've got a bed.

525
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,100
All I want to do at the moment is get some sleep.

526
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,740
Just some, you know?

527
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,300
I think middle age has made me boring.

528
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,700
I've got a beautiful wife, lovely house, nice job, etc.

529
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,580
All the stuff that most people strive to get.

530
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,940
And yet I'm still searching for something.

531
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,180
Perhaps all men get like that, I don't know.

532
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,020
Perhaps I make a mid-life crisis.

533
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,700
I don't like myself as much as I used to, put it that way.

534
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,900
I think I need a new adventure, to put that right.

535
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,140
Do you want to help us get a sink, just to cover this up?

536
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,140
Cos it's going out already.

537
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,020
An hour before sunset...

538
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,260
The heavens have opened, as expected.

539
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,620
We've got a fire going.

540
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,540
Yeah, but we've got to put...

541
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,380
This is brilliant.

542
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,820
However, it is now pissing down with rain.

543
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,460
We've got no cover over it whatsoever.

544
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,340
We've got nowhere to sleep whatsoever.

545
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,820
So I would say our priority is shelter.

546
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,780
Honestly, in the politest way possible,

547
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,300
we need to cover up this fucking fire cos it's going to go out.

548
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,980
Without the fire, the men will have no means of purifying water to drink.

549
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,300
Who is doing the leaves? Is anybody getting the leaves to cover this?

550
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,420
That is going out in about half an hour.

551
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:21,140
Yeah, clusterfuck. Or foovar. I don't know what the correct military term is.

552
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,140
So now we've got a million people trying to do a million things.

553
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,100
Hopefully we'll have a million answers.

554
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,580
George is fucking mad.

555
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
This rain is absolutely unbelievable.

556
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,700
You don't ever see rain like this in the UK.

557
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,300
Absolutely, completely...

558
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,300
Stoking.

559
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,260
8pm.

560
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,580
The men are still desperately trying to make a watertight shelter

561
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,380
to save their fire.

562
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,380
Over and under. That's it.

563
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,820
See if we can bend it, Bart.

564
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,100
In this part of the Pacific, storms can last for days

565
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,540
and dump inches of rain in an hour.

566
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
It's a great night.

567
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,980
Obviously, we're staying dry under the shelter that we've made.

568
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,340
It's a good job we made it, otherwise we'd be absolutely saturated right now.

569
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,060
The roof might need possibly a tweak or two.

570
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,780
There is a minor bit of snagging before practical completion.

571
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,220
It's just something simple like perhaps taking the whole fucking thing down and redoing it.

572
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,380
Has anyone checked on Andy?

573
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,660
Fuck, we've got one.

574
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
Andy!

575
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,820
Andy!

576
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,020
Andy!

577
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,700
We've got a headlight, guys.

578
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,100
Andy chose to not help the group in any way, shape or form.

579
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,620
And went off on his own.

580
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,780
Andy's here.

581
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,300
Vicky and Andy's here under the tree.

582
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,860
I think Andy needs to get a little bit more involved with this all, to be honest.

583
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,260
It absolutely pissed down last night.

584
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,500
Everyone was awake and everyone was just so wet through.

585
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,860
I was sat there and I was just thinking, what am I doing here?

586
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,740
I feel kind of pissed.

587
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,820
Yeah. It's weird.

588
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:13,980
Yeah.

589
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,940
I feel like...

590
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,620
I've had a couple of pints.

591
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,180
I can't move my legs.

592
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,060
I've sat up, I just can't move.

593
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,060
Has the bed paralysed you?

594
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,140
Yeah. That's great.

595
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,460
Completely numb from cocked down.

596
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,260
6am.

597
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,780
Last night, a violent tropical storm battered the island.

598
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,580
After a desperate struggle, the group managed to save their fire

599
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,060
with a small temporary shelter.

600
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,420
But the men themselves had no protection from the elements.

601
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,660
Video diary.

602
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,140
I don't know what day it is.

603
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,060
I don't know if it's day two, day three.

604
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Still no sleep after getting on the island.

605
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,340
I think I've had about, honestly, swear to God, an hour's sleep.

606
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,580
I can't do it.

607
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,900
I've got to think about myself now, you know?

608
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,620
Yeah. I've been up all fucking night.

609
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,180
I'm a mess because of it.

610
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,780
Sleep really is critical to survival

611
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,460
because it affects our physical and our mental health.

612
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
When you get enough of it, it helps your body to recover,

613
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,620
to heal, you process thoughts, process memories,

614
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,940
but when you don't get enough of it, that's when you become careless,

615
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,140
it affects your decision-making abilities

616
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
and it can even lead to depression.

617
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,420
How you doing, fella?

618
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,660
Ooh. What's up?

619
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,420
I'm struggling a bit, I think.

620
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,780
At the moment. With?

621
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,700
The mentality of it all.

622
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,580
You know what I mean? You've got to get yourself in, like...

623
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,020
..in the zone, as it were, and I'm struggling to find the zone, at the moment.

624
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,660
I'm really worried about Joe.

625
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,700
He's just kind of wandering around, sitting down, head in his hands.

626
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,500
I kind of think he's feeling sorry for himself, really,

627
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,380
and he's obviously missing home.

628
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,100
What's her name? Charlotte.

629
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,980
SHE SIGHS

630
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,140
Maximum three. You miss her, mate, don't you?

631
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,620
So, he made it in two.

632
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,860
SHE SIGHS

633
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,660
Yeah.

634
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,340
Yeah.

635
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,100
Best thing that happened to me, though.

636
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
How long have you been together? Five years.

637
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,940
For the first time ever, since I met her,

638
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,820
that I've gone 24 hours without speaking to her, so...

639
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,980
In fact, you might...

640
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,580
Come on, dude, hug it out!

641
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,820
You'll be fine, mate, you'll be absolutely fine, honestly.

642
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,380
You'll be fine, honestly.

643
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,140
HE SIGHS

644
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,060
If I don't have a good night's sleep fairly soon,

645
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,300
I'm going to end up throttling someone inadvertently.

646
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm not joking.

647
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,580
I'll lose my rag.

648
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,900
I don't want a bed to sleep in.

649
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,220
I'm not going to get soaking wet.

650
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,340
SHE SIGHS

651
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,580
The group are relying on their two builders, Andy and Paul,

652
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,940
to construct a new watertight shelter.

653
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,060
But both have a very different idea about where to put it.

654
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,420
We need to pick a location to build this shelter on.

655
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
Correct.

656
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,460
We have two potential locations.

657
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,260
Andy, is your place on the beach?

658
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,260
Yeah.

659
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,780
SHE SIGHS

660
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,060
I can put any of these little bits of thicket and brush

661
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
into it easily.

662
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,660
Look, we've got a pit there for a fire pit.

663
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,020
This is an absolutely perfect camp.

664
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,700
Job's good.

665
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,500
This is not Andy's, is it?

666
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,140
You're more exposed to the tides, you're more exposed to the weather,

667
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,100
and we're going to get bitten to smotherings by sandflies.

668
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,060
It's not an option. No way.

669
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,460
Andy's camp, it looks like it'll flood at the tidal surge,

670
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,860
there's plastic bottles everywhere, I think we'll get bitten to shit.

671
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,460
Pointless. Give me my opinion, mate.

672
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,820
Fucking nobody listened to fucking me.

673
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,020
I would love to have come down here for Andy's sake and gone,

674
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,740
this is fucking brilliant, mate.

675
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,460
But the trouble is, we walked in here and I kept my mouth shut,

676
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,660
but within 30 seconds, everyone went, are you fucking joking?

677
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,260
I'm a builder. People get me in to fix anything.

678
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,460
Customers phone me up to put their IKEA bedroom stuff together.

679
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,460
It's like, well, fuck you then.

680
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,300
With Andy's site rejected, Paul shows the men his preferred location.

681
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,260
Because it's elevated, this is not really going to be good.

682
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,020
It's not really going to get that wet.

683
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,900
It's got a fairly good canopy. We can all sleep here on the dry.

684
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,420
Correct. You've got a nice little breeze coming through as well.

685
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,420
Yeah, I like this place.

686
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,380
Now, what do you want me to do, Paul?

687
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,380
Well, what we need now are the cross members.

688
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,900
I've bitched about Paul being a volcanic rhinoceros,

689
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,420
but you know what, he's single-minded,

690
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,420
but he makes clear decisions and sticks by them,

691
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,900
and he's been right more than he's been wrong so far.

692
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
Ah!

693
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,300
We're fucking saved. We'll be all right now.

694
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,300
We knew there was power on the island.

695
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,580
How are you finding it?

696
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,940
A bit shocked at how... Difficult.

697
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,260
..how difficult it's been.

698
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,860
We're all here doing the same shit.

699
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,100
We're all not sure whether we should see it or not.

700
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,100
Determined to boost Joe's morale and keep his mind off home,

701
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,700
father of three, Vic, has asked him to join in with the shelter build.

702
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,060
It's a challenge.

703
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,020
We'll adapt to all this, quicker than any of us will.

704
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Far quicker.

705
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,540
It's a case of making sure everybody guides everybody else

706
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,020
in the right direction.

707
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,980
I do firmly believe we will become an excellent team,

708
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,180
er, to the point of becoming almost like a tribe.

709
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,740
Can we just say, building camp at the top of a steep hill

710
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,860
in the middle of rainy season is the stupidest idea

711
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
we've ever had?

712
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,940
Yeah.

713
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Ever had.

714
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,820
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

715
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,420
And I'm obviously the weakest link.

716
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,660
Joe, you're not the weakest link, you're just missing home.

717
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,860
It's a natural thing to feel.

718
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,980
I think some people do think I'm the weakest link, mate.

719
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,980
Do you think that?

720
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,980
I don't think so.

721
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,980
No, but I think you do.

722
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,980
Do you think so? Yeah.

723
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,380
Crikey, what's made you think that?

724
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,260
Day one when I met you, you've been shouting orders at me from day dot.

725
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,260
Have I? No.

726
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,900
We're carrying stuff in and out of a jungle

727
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,740
and I've got a really heavy rucksack on my back

728
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,940
and you're saying, Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do this.

729
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,940
Joe, I think it's a good idea if you do that.

730
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,180
I don't know if it happens to anyone else,

731
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,420
but I think you feel that I'm the youngest,

732
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,340
therefore, naturally, you've got some authority over me.

733
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,140
And that's been grinding on me a little bit.

734
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Joe intimated that I'd been giving him a hard time,

735
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,820
which I truly have only tried to be positive with everybody.

736
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,180
I was devastated.

737
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,500
You're being aggressive. I'm telling you what.

738
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,260
You're being passive aggressive and that's not fair.

739
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,420
All right?

740
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,860
He just told me I'm being passive aggressive

741
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,020
while we're having a laugh.

742
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,620
I'm being passive aggressive.

743
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,460
I'm being passive aggressive.

744
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm being passive aggressive, you know.

745
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,860
However bad your situation is, you can't wallow in negativity.

746
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,660
Survival is about dogged determination,

747
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,300
learning from your failures and never giving up.

748
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Churchill once said a great quote.

749
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,580
He said, if you're going through hell, keep going.

750
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,460
My balls are doing the backstroke in a bucket of sand.

751
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,820
I'm hungry. I'm tired.

752
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,940
All that's going through my head is, I don't self-arm at home,

753
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
so why the hell am I self-arming out here?

754
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
6am.

755
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,940
I've never been in an environment where last night you hear a thunderstorm

756
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,940
and it's now daylight and it's still thundering and it's still raining.

757
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Overnight, torrential rain has once again battered the island.

758
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,940
The men have managed to protect the fire, but their spirits are low.

759
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,940
It is a bit mind-boggling that you can have this much rain in so long.

760
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
It just keeps coming.

761
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,940
Yesterday, the men started work on a new shelter.

762
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,940
But only half built, it was no match for the elements.

763
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,940
I'm massively underestimated at this place. Massively.

764
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm so scared of hiking for as long as I can remember.

765
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Last night, when I got my first Hunger Rumble,

766
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
it was playing on my mind a lot more.

767
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
It's hard.

768
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,940
This is apocalyptic weather.

769
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,940
It's going to threaten to wash us out of this camp.

770
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,940
For the third night in a row, the men have barely slept.

771
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
The positive? It's daytime.

772
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,940
I can see how crap it is.

773
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Here in the tropics, when it rains...

774
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,940
It's not just nice British drizzle, it's torrential.

775
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,940
We can hardly hold a conversation.

776
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,940
You've got to spend so much time and energy trying to keep your fire alight

777
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,940
when you could be out there fishing or hunting or making shelters.

778
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,940
However strong and determined, after a while, it saps you.

779
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,940
It saps your spirit in the same way it saps a life out of a fire.

780
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I cannot face another day on here. Honestly, I can't.

781
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
I'm at the stage of almost a breakdown, to be totally honest.

782
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
You just can't imagine.

783
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,940
I can't imagine how tough it is.

784
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
Unbelievable.

785
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,940
The island's youngest member, Joe, says he's had enough.

786
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,940
Four weeks, I think, would be a push for me.

787
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Six weeks, anything I'd ever make.

788
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,940
The pain that I'm going to go through here,

789
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,940
leaving the loved ones at home, Charlotte, all the rest of it...

790
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
Then why did you sign up?

791
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
I don't know.

792
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,940
10am. The storm finally passes.

793
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Determined to leave as soon as possible,

794
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,940
graphic designer Joe uses the emergency satellite radio

795
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
to request an evacuation boat.

796
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,940
I just really strongly believe that as a person,

797
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,940
physically, mentally and all the rest of it,

798
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,940
I'm not going to make the rest of the time on the island.

799
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
And I've not made any rash decisions, cos I'm aware that you can make decisions

800
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,940
in the heat of a moment.

801
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
And I haven't.

802
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,940
I just really fancy a margarita pizza.

803
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Joe wants to go home.

804
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
I can't believe it.

805
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
He's not been here four days.

806
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,940
He's not even started and he wants to go home.

807
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Joe has agreed to stay on the island for another 24 hours

808
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,940
before making a final decision about whether he wants to leave.

809
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
You hold it up there, mark it and then we'll cut it.

810
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Is it long enough?

811
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
No.

812
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
You can go halfway there.

813
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
You can go halfway there.

814
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,940
In the jungle, work continues on the shelter.

815
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Can you get that any higher?

816
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
The group have persuaded Andy to help out,

817
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,940
hoping the prospect of a dry night will encourage him to stay.

818
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
One there.

819
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Yeah.

820
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
And then one down here.

821
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Right, so not there then?

822
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Eh?

823
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
So not there then?

824
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I didn't say to put it there.

825
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,940
The whole reason I said I don't want to tie a sled knot in this piece

826
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
is because we need to get the piece of wood in there first.

827
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Paul is a project manager in a construction company

828
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
and Andy is a builder.

829
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,940
Them two personalities just clash

830
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,940
because one wants to tell the other one what to do

831
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,940
and then this one wants to tell this one what to do.

832
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
All we need to do is tie this on here, please.

833
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
That's all we need to do.

834
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Where's the bit of wood?

835
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Because I'm not tying a fucking knot if there ain't a bit of wood in it.

836
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Look, that ain't going nowhere.

837
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
That's the shape I want.

838
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,940
Andy really has a massive problem with me.

839
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Everybody's been tip-toeing around me for the past four days.

840
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,940
It's just been a fucking prick.

841
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
But what can you do?

842
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Something's just going to explode at some point.

843
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,940
Since yesterday, Andy has been hinting

844
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,940
that he too might request evacuation from the island.

845
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Why are you threatening to go home, Andy?

846
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
All sorts of reasons, mate.

847
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Come on, spit us out.

848
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
No, I don't need to.

849
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
Why are you so aggressive?

850
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,940
I'm asking you a simple question.

851
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,940
Yeah, you've asked me it three times.

852
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
The first time should have been enough.

853
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
Then the second time.

854
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Now you're asking a fourth time.

855
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
No, they were different questions.

856
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
And then you're calling me aggressive

857
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,940
because I don't want to answer a question that you've asked four times.

858
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,940
I haven't asked it four times.

859
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
You have.

860
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
I said, why do you want to go home?

861
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
You went, because I do.

862
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
I went, well, give us a reason.

863
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,940
You went, I'm not going to give you a reason.

864
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,940
Exactly.

865
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
So then you asked again.

866
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,940
There must be a reason.

867
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
And then you asked again.

868
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
I didn't ask again, Andy.

869
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
You did.

870
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
What is the fucking matter with you?

871
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Nothing the matter with me, son.

872
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,940
At all.

873
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
Do we wedge that there and then prop it up?

874
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Whatever Andy wants to do.

875
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I've had enough.

876
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Hang on.

877
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,940
We need your expertise.

878
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I said, stop asking me.

879
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,940
And he carried on asking me.

880
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Fucking unbelievable.

881
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,940
With the camp's two builders walking off the job,

882
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
construction of the shelter grinds to a halt.

883
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,940
There's no doubt there's a lot of strong, pretty macho personalities on the men's island.

884
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,940
And yeah, they're all trying to find their place in that pecking order.

885
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,940
But the danger when you get these high pressure situations like this is that the alpha males

886
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,940
start to compete instead of cooperate.

887
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,940
And then the danger is it blows a whole group apart.

888
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
I'm used to being in control.

889
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
I'm used to being organized, everything running efficiently.

890
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,940
It's what I do.

891
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,940
That ignorant twat wants to do it his way.

892
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
Yeah.

893
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
I have no fucking clue.

894
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
It makes your head.

895
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,940
It's like it wants to implode.

896
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Seriously, my world is a punch to the throat.

897
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
He's down.

898
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Gone.

899
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
Finished.

900
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
It's over with.

901
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
I walk away.

902
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Happy days.

903
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
I can't do that here.

904
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,940
Bang.

905
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
Done.

906
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Fat cunt.

907
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
You know what I mean?

908
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:50,940
There's a lot of bad blood in camp at the minute, largely between Paul and Andy.

909
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,940
We've got enough on our plate in this island without alpha male dick swinging.

910
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,940
I think everyone just needs to man the fuck up, really.

911
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,940
I just feel like everything I do, mate, he's just there, ready to fucking knock it down,

912
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
you know, or criticize.

913
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
It's like, fuck off, you know?

914
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
If he goes, I'll stay.

915
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
People might make problems.

916
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:23,940
So I overheard a conversation with Andy.

917
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
His exact words were,

918
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,940
if Paul leaves, that would be good because then I will stay.

919
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,940
I'm not dealing with that sort of immaturity.

920
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,940
He's supposed to be a grown man.

921
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
I'm not being blackmailed.

922
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,940
I don't need to be surrounded by this immaturity.

923
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,940
I might just have to go.

924
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Are you thinking about fucking off?

925
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Can't be fucking bothered.

926
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
Mate, you can't go, mate.

927
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
You literally can't go.

928
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,940
Do you think that you would regret it later on?

929
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
You will regret it.

930
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
I think I won't.

931
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Just suck it up, mate.

932
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Lift up your skirt.

933
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,940
Wash the sand out of your vagina, mate.

934
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
In a disastrous turn of events,

935
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,940
three men, including the island's two builders,

936
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,940
are now threatening to walk.

937
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,940
Andy, Paul and Joe all want to leave this island.

938
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,940
I'm amazed that they've come this far

939
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,940
and want to give up so early.

940
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,940
As yet another storm hits the island,

941
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,940
the men call a crisis meeting.

942
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,940
I know it sounds cutthroat,

943
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,940
but we need to keep as many of those guys here as we can.

944
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,940
But for any of them to change their mind is a win.

945
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,940
There's been so much discussion about people leaving.

946
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,940
My personal opinion is that we are stronger together

947
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,940
than we are apart.

948
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Agreed.

949
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Joe, my hope is that you might have thought differently...

950
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,940
We've already done this.

951
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,940
I've already had the chat with everyone.

952
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
People have already said their thoughts.

953
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,940
I've already said my thoughts, but...

954
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,940
On that note,

955
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,940
I will be saying no more.

956
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,940
I'll just be waiting for the boat to arrive and to leave, OK?

957
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Paul, would you just let us know

958
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,940
how you're feeling at the moment?

959
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,940
I came to this island as a bit of a release,

960
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,940
you know, to get away from my everyday life.

961
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
I'm not really confrontational.

962
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
I don't like having arguments with people.

963
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,940
I'd rather just step away from the situation.

964
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,940
The final nail in the coffin was to hear somebody say

965
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,940
that it was good that I was going,

966
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,940
which I thought was a bit of a shame,

967
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,940
but in another way, it confirmed my decision.

968
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,940
And in that case, that's why I decided to go.

969
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,940
If one goes, there's no point in the other going.

970
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,940
Right, here we go.

971
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,940
How we make that decision...

972
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,940
Here we go.

973
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,940
This is now we're getting to the country.

974
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,940
He's segregated himself from the group from day one.

975
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,940
We're having a discussion, he doesn't want to know.

976
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,940
We haven't got any beds, he makes himself a bed.

977
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,940
He goes off in socks.

978
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
Somehow, that's my fault.

979
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,940
I've had no sleep the whole day.

980
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Neither has anybody.

981
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,940
You've been sleeping.

982
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Sorry, mate, you've been sleeping.

983
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,940
Andy, nobody's had any sleep.

984
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,940
As a group, no-one here has had enough sleep

985
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,940
to give them the energy to do what they're about to do the next day.

986
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,940
So you pointing a finger at me and saying,

987
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,940
well, you've had sleep, fine, that's your problem.

988
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,940
I've been having a laugh up until I heard

989
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,940
one of my team-mates say they wanted me to go.

990
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,940
I was having a right crack.

991
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,940
Now I'm not.

992
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,940
In a community, not everyone gets on,

993
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,940
and that is a fact of life.

994
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,940
We can't change that.

995
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,940
So let's build our community.

996
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,940
You and you, just keep your distance.

997
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,940
At least we're together.

998
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,940
We're two men up.

999
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,940
We can build a shelter in a day

1000
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,940
rather than taking two days with two men down.

1001
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
The big strong man and the builder.

1002
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,940
If you two fuck off, then we're fucked, aren't we?

1003
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
See, I don't want to lose two builders,

1004
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,940
regardless of your characters.

1005
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,940
We need you to stay.

1006
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,940
I'm going to walk away, and then that would hopefully...

1007
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,940
No, listen.

1008
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,940
So Andy can engage.

1009
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,940
Enjoy his experience, and hopefully five.

1010
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,940
Then you're not losing two people, are you?

1011
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,940
You're losing one.

1012
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,940
I'm leaving the island.

1013
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,940
Whether Paul leaves or not.

1014
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,940
Whether Paul leaves or not.

1015
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,940
I would rather Paul stay.

1016
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,940
He's a stronger man than me.

1017
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
He'll be more benefit to you.

1018
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,940
But either way, I'm sorry, I'm going.

1019
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,940
For him to fucking say, I'm glad he's going, good,

1020
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,940
then I'll stay, then all of a sudden

1021
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,940
he hasn't got his own way again,

1022
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,940
and it's, oh, I'm going, there's other reasons.

1023
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,940
It's fucking immaturity.

1024
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,940
It's sulking, and it's attention-seeking.

1025
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,940
And you don't want to be scapegoated, I realise this.

1026
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,940
Pollocks, absolute pollocks. I'm not having it.

1027
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,940
I am going off this island,

1028
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,940
because I'm not being held responsible for that.

1029
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
End of story.

1030
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
Next time on The Women's Island...

1031
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
Oh, my God!

1032
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,940
A huge fucking snake came towards me!

1033
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,940
Fucking hell!

1034
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,940
At the minute, we are barely coping

1035
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,940
with the situation in which we find ourselves.

1036
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,940
Oh, shit, no, wait, sit forward.

1037
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,940
We have nothing to drink.

1038
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,940
We don't know where we are.

1039
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,940
Hello!

1040
